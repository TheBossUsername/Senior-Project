The movement you perform on Round 1 will become your momentum for the next round, and so on.<br/><br/>But that&rsquo;s not all.

Assemble your team, visit haunted locations and submit evidence to close the cases - but be warned - not only must you deal with Murphy's Law, but with other paranormal teams investigating the same places as you - and chances are, they won't be helpful. Never before has Paranormal Division been so fun!<br/><br/>Players compete to score the most points they can by playing Evidence cards at three separate locations. Each turn a player picks up a card and either plays or discards a card - each time they are faced with a choice: they can play a card to help themselves or to hinder their opponent.  Event cards are triggered at various points in the game to introduce an element of randomness and can either be good or bad - you never know!<br/><br/>Meant as a stand-alone game, it can be played straight out of the box.  Expansions are being developed to keep gameplay fresh, while maintaining the core rules.<br/><br/>",

But there have always been a few brave souls who have fought to hold it back. They are called HUNTERS. Hunters: Battle of Arkady is a fully cooperative action/horror board game for 2 to 6 players ages 13 and up.<br/><br/>Hunters: Battle of Arkady uses poker-sized cards to create a dynamic playing board, allowing each game experience to be different. Players then work together to defeat the Arch-Demon Avenastur before the town of Arkady is consumed by darkness. Players have a choice of six characters to play as, each with individual stats and abilities. During the course of play, additional monsters are revealed and must be fought or dismissed as the character's abilities allow.<br/><br/>Each turn has eight phases, beginning with the character's movement about the board. Avenastur (the Demon) then moves to &quot;chase&quot; the nearest player. If the player has moved, then one or more monster cards are revealed. Once there is a monster in the player's &quot;stack&quot; then the attack/defense part of their turn begins. The player must always roll their attack, depending on the number of d6s their character has, and then roll the attack of the monster who attempts to hit them. Once all the monsters in the &quot;stack&quot; are defeated, the character my Investigate their location. Certain locations have special perks, such as extra lives that can be collected for use by any player, or additional abilities granted to all players. Next the player can regen their health/mana pool as their stats allow. Finally, the Growing Darkness phase flips a location card facedown, losing any special perks remaining, and ending the player's turn.<br/><br/>The game is won or lost depending on the defeat of the &quot;Main Boss&quot; Avenastur. Killing him wins the game for all the players. However, if the town of Arkady is overrun by the Growing Darkness, the players lose.<br/><br/>",

        "description": "The rules of the game, for example, start out with this explanation: &ldquo;Unlike other board games, nobody really wins at Administration. During the game each player gets poorer as, little by little, all money and property pass into the hands of the Administration. Thus the game is much like real life.<br/><br/>The object is to remain &ldquo;financially solvent&rdquo; if possible and the winner is the player who is still able to pay of his debts at the end of the game.<br/><br/>As one plops around the board, after a throw of the dice, he is able to pick up certain pieces of property.<br/><br/>These include such holdings as &ldquo;The Managed News Service&rdquo;, the &ldquo;Re-run TV Network,&rdquo; the &ldquo;Feather bedded Railroad&rdquo;, the &ldquo;Lemon Auto Co.,&rdquo; the &ldquo;Rusty Steel Co.,&rdquo; and the &ldquo;Big Brother Power Co.&rdquo;<br/><br/>HOWEVER, THERE ARE other blocks to land on and some of these carry rather snide directions such as:<br/>&ldquo;Collect $2,000 for information on fellow taxpayer.&rdquo;<br/>Or, &ldquo;Election time; Administration exacts your contribution. Pay $3,000.&rdquo;<br/>Or, &ldquo;You are remanded to public psychiatric hearing for remark critical to the administration; lose one turn.&rdquo;<br/>Or, &ldquo;You get free Medicare but each other player pays tax of $1,500.&rdquo;<br/><br/>Apparently, the game can get quite complicated. Quoting again from the rules: &ldquo;When a player lands on another player&rsquo;s privately owned property, rent shown on the deed is paid as follows:<br/>1. The landing player pays rent to the property owner.<br/>2. The property owner is taxed half of his rent by the Administration, except that unions are exempt from this tax.<br/>3. If the property has a union, and if the union is owned, the property owner pays half of his remaining rent to the owner of the union.&rdquo;<br/><br/>Still another aspect of the games comes in the collection of cards the player must draw from time to time.<br/><br/>These are broken down into three groups, &ldquo;Planning, Court Rulings and Favoritism.&rdquo;<br/><br/>The Planning cards include such directions as:<br/>&ldquo;Share the wealth. Give $5,000 to the player who has the least cash.&rdquo;<br/>&ldquo;Administration announces a new welfare program. You get something for nothing. A new tax. Pay $5,000&Prime;.<br/>&ldquo;By extensive correspondence, you refute Administration claim that you owe $600 in back taxes. Pay $500 postage.&rdquo;<br/>&ldquo;Administrative planning staff hires malcontent leftist professors recently employed by the university. Pay $2,000 staff salaries.&rdquo;<br/><br/>&ldquo;COURT RULINGS&rdquo; cards include these notices:<br/>&ldquo;You win case but must pay $1,000 to Administration for court record.&rdquo;<br/>&ldquo;You lose case and are charged $3,000 for contempt of court.<br/><br/>&ldquo;FAVORITISM&rdquo; cards run like this:<br/>&ldquo;Rusty Steel Co. gets order from Communist for 190 million shovels. Administration subsidizes sale. If you own the company, collect $5,000 from the Administration.&rdquo;<br/>&ldquo;Administration gives you $9,000 for concocting an October crises for the next election.&rdquo;<br/>&ldquo;Collect $3,000 for not raising cotton.&rdquo;<br/>&ldquo;As a relative of the chief administrator, you get cheap oil lease from Administration, which you sell back at a profit. Collect $4,000.&rdquo;<br/><br/>According to the message on the box the game comes in, Administration is &ldquo;simple enough for children&rdquo; and &ldquo;delightful for adults.&rdquo;<br/><br/>",

The object is to get the most supplies to each of the four major moons. The challenge is to balance fuel and cargo. Each ship carries six units of fuel (represented by dice). Each cargo token displaces a fuel die. To move to the next port roll the dice. Rolls of 1 or 2 are displaced as spent. If any fuel dice remain, move up the track. At each port you can deposit or collect cargo tokens but you can only deposit other players' cargo tokens at Mars.<br/><br/>",

        "description": "Microvores is a 2-4 player game in which players assume the role of a microorganism, and must choose to seek out food, avoid toxins, attack other players, evolve, mutate, or subdivide during their turn.  The winner is the player who had the last microbe alive, or is the first player to begin their turn with 5 microbes.<br/><br/>In addition to the beginning and ending administrative phases of each player's turn, the 3 key phases are the Metabolism Phase, the Drift Phase, and the Action Phase.  During the Metabolism Phase, the player must choose to pay food or take damage to fuel their turn's activity.  The Drift Phase involves randomly determining where to place food, toxins, and special particles on the game board available for all players to consume.  The Action Phase allows players to choose one action: Hunting &amp; Gathering (includes moving, eating, and attacking), Evolving, Mutating, OR Subdividing.<br/><br/>Evolving costs a player 3 food, but allows them to draw an evolution card at random which grants their microbe(s) abilities, possibly to move further, attack harder, and/or have some other unique ability.  Mutating costs a player 4 food (and one evolution - if any), but it increases the total number of evolution cards a player can have in play, the base movement, and the base damage of the player's microbe(s).  Mutation also allows some damage to be healed.  Subdividing costs a player 5 food per subdivision, but each subdivision creates a new microbe on the board for the player, allowing them alternate start locations each turn, an extra life should a microbe be destroyed, and moves the player closer to a win condition.<br/><br/>",

Who will be the first to establish their own nest and win the game?<br/><br/>Players take turn swooping the velt momonga from the tree branch to the landing tree in the center. Your momonga lands successfully if it sticks to the landing tree, which is divided into 3 parts by 2 lines. Depending on where your momonga lands, you either move 1, 2 or 3 spaces on the circle tile surrounding the landing tree. If you land on a tile with a paw print, you collect a food by taking one of the outer circle tokens. If you land on a tile where there is another momonga already, you can steal a food from that player.<br/>There are 5 different kinds of foods and the aim is to collect 4 different types. The place where you gathered the last of the required food tokens will be your nest. Next you have to go around the forest one more time to inform your friends of your new home. The first player to complete the circle and land exactly on their own nest, wins the game.<br/><br/>The game also includes leaf tokens. You can exchange a food token for a leaf token. A leaf token can be played for one of the following two actions:<br/>1) You momonga is allowed to try one more jump.<br/>2) When another player's momonga is making it's jump, you can blow from behind the landing tree to hinder them.<br/><br/>The rulebook contains a few optional rules to change the base game and some other game variants.<br/><br/>",

One player can move the pawns along columns, while the other moves them along rows. Players cannot move the same pawn they moved the previous turn, so strategy is built around knowing which choices your opponent has next, and working to make those choices miserable &mdash; thus putting them in a dilemma. Some of the tiles affect the board when collected: moving tiles or pawns, returning pieces to the board, or stealing tiles from an opponent. When neither player can move, the game ends and whoever has the most points wins.<br/><br/>Skillful maneuvering and forethought are the name of the game in this engaging, classical board game.<br/><br/>",

Players have eight matching tiles that they take turns placing orthogonally into a grid, in an attempt to link three or four in a row.

The grid also varies in size and dimensions based on the number of players.<br/><br/>Spurs and Sprockets sets comes with sixteen tiles and rules for many different ways of playing, ranging from a simple Tic-Tac-Toe-like game where players gain 8 points for four in a row and 3 points for each set of three in a row, to a game where every placement of a tile may result in an attack and removal of another tile.<br/><br/>",

It is designed for a small number of players to recreate the larger battles of this era in a reasonable time.  It is not an overly simple game, but it is designed to have simple and quick mechanics to speed play.<br/><br/>Each side has a fleet of ships (represented by counters or miniatures) subdivided into squadrons.  VUS is based on squadron maneuvers rather than individual ship movement, although each ship is individually moved within the requirements of the planned maneuver.  The movement system uses a true 12-direction movement system on a hex grid that is unique among games of this genre.  Squadron maneuver cards and random event cards recreate the challenges of command &amp; control of a fleet of sailing warships.<br/><br/>VUS uses a &ldquo;Hordes o&rsquo;Dice System&rdquo; for combat that is based on the use of different types of dice to represent various types of cannon batteries.  The dice mimic the results of a traditional combat results table without the need to reference charts.<br/><br/>The game includes more than 30 scenarios from 3 wars.<br/><br/>",

The Recommended Variant is the 3 player free-for-all game which is the basic setup of the game's gameplay. The game can be played 1 versus 1 which will still use the play mat and will still use the unit positioning area such as the left/right flank unit placement.<br/><br/>Game Objective: Reduce all opponents&rsquo; Leader life Points to zero.<br/><br/>Game Setup:<br/><br/>1. Select Race Players choose which race they wish to play and thoroughly shuffle their decks. Pass each deck counter-clockwise to next player for reshuffling until it goes back to the designated player.<br/><br/>2. Place Leader Card Each player must place their leader Card in the field (playmat designated area). A Leader Card starts with 30 Health Points. (If a leader&rsquo;s life points drops to zero, that player is eliminated from the game).<br/><br/>3. Determine Play Order    Randomly select which player will go first. After the first player&rsquo;s turn, player turn order will resume in a counter-clockwise direction.<br/><br/>4. Draw Hand Cards    All players must draw 6 cards from their chosen deck. Every play turn, players can draw 2 cards in their library. All players can assign up to 2 cards on the mining placement area which will produce 1 gold per card per turn. The more cards assigned to the mining area, the more gold it produces. However, re-assigning the cards/using the cards from the mining area has an additional cost of 4 gold. It is the penalty for the cards being re-assigned as unit in the field.<br/><br/>5. First Turn    The first player begins their turn and performs the actions described in the Play Sequence section of these rules.<br/><br/>Game Play Sequence:<br/><br/>These are all the actions a player may perform during their turn. Each action must be completed in the order designated below. In a free-for-all game, the player chosen to go first takes their turn. Next, in a consecutive order (going in a counter-clockwise direction), the other players will fulfill their turns.<br/><br/>1.    Re-draw (Optional) A player can elect to declare a Re-Draw action at the start of their turn. This action is performed in place of any of the regular actions associated with a typical turn. When a player has no useful cards in their hand, they can choose to use the Re-draw action. The Re-Draw action allows a player to discard their hand of cards and draw 6 new cards from their deck. This action ends their turn. The player is not allowed to take any more actions, and will not be able to produce any Gold until their next turn. Note: If you don&rsquo;t need to Re-Draw, skip this action and take a normal turn. Simply begin your turn with the collect Gold action and precede through the subsequent action steps until you wrap up your turn with the Upkeep action.<br/><br/>2.    Collect Gold Collect the amount of Gold equal to the total Gold on all of the cards placed on the mining area.<br/><br/>3.    Draw Card Draw 2 cards from your Race deck.<br/><br/>4.    Activate Cards This action lets you establish and activate any type of cards, use    Command cards, and/or assign new units.    During this play sequence, a player may perform all four of these options: - Play 2 Card to the mining field. Note: All cards in the mining field should be placed facedown. - Play any number of Passive and Instant Command Cards.    - Play any unit cards to assign any number of new units on the left/right flank.<br/><br/>5.    Re-assign Once the unit is re-assigned from mining area to any of the field flank, it cannot go back to the mining area. However, once a unit is assigned to any flank, you can re-assign it the other flank with a cost of 2 gold.<br/><br/>For further information of the game's &quot;How to play&quot;, please download the game's Rule Book.<br/><br/>",

        "description": "&quot;Able Archer&quot; is wargaming syst&eacute;m, which will put players into role of company or battalion commanders durning fictional conflict in 1983. You will assume command of NATO or WARPAC ground forces. You will lead tanks,infantry but even artillery or airforces. You will be fighting in conflict that was greatest fear of every politician and commander durning Cold war. Can you defeat Soviets before they could reach the Rhine? Or will you lead final push towards the Paris as Soviet commander?<br/>Able Archer unlike many games situated in Cold war gone hot scen&aacute;rio, is played in 1:1 scale. That means 1 vehicle represent one vehicle, base of infantry represents team and so on.<br/>In smaller games you will lead companies, while in larger games you can command battalions or even regiment worth of troops.<br/><br/>",

        "description": "Lords of Conquest is a strategy game of territorial struggle.  You begin by taking turns selecting territories on a game map.  Because of their locations and wealth, some of these territories will be important and powerful, while others will be insignificant and weak.  The rich ones contain &quot;resources&quot; such as Gold, Horses, Iron, Coal, or Timber, which you will work to acquire because of the powerful weapons and cities they can buy.<br/><br/>The action in Lords of Conquest takes place in yearly cycles.  Each year has four of five phases.  During each phase, you will have an opportunity to make decisions in preparation for that year's action.  The first phase is Development, during which you can invest in new weapons and cities.  Development begins during the second year, and is the first phase of all subsequent years.  The other phases are 1. Productions, in which your resource-bearing territories produce wealth; 2. Trading; 3. Shipment, in which you have an opportunity to move either your wealth or some of your forces to a more strategic location; and 4. Conquest, in which you relentlessly assault your neighbors' territories.<br/><br/>Battles between territories are decided on the basis of the number of supporting territories and forces (in the form of weapons, horses, boats and cities) held by each side.  During the year, all the players will have a chance to expand their territories and wealth at the expense of their neighbors.  Ultimately, you become strong enough to start building cities. The first player to build three cities, and successfully defend them for a year, is the winner.  One last word of advice, show no mercy, and expect none!  Not everyone has what it takes rules the world.<br/><br/>",

All of the various weapons and systems whose use was formerly tracked using check boxes on unit Data Cards have been modified to simple (Depletion or Usage) die roll functions, obviating the need for most written records during game play, and many other sections have been edited or re-written for better clarity and ease of implementation.<br/><br/>Every section of each rulebook has been collated and consolidated into a unified whole, with all related rules being found in their respective sections. Some of the rules, vehicle systems and infantry attributes have been removed or consolidated to single entries to avoid redundancies, and a few new rules and options have been added for those wishing to implement them.<br/><br/>Each section that has been significantly altered has been marked so that veteran players will quickly be able to grasp the differences and improvements in how the game is played. While the Strike Legion Tactical Rules Compendium is not written in a progressive learning format, sections that are not critical for new players to learn before their first game are also clearly marked, allowing them to begin their first game in short order.<br/><br/>Additional game features include:<br/><br/>6 general scenarios playable with any forces, with some scenarios offering significant suggested variants to change the nature and scope of the action<br/>100 pre-designed unit Data Cards representing the four human and two non-human factions involved in humanity&rsquo;s First Secession War, along with organizational charts for each faction.<br/>A revised Unit Construction section that allows players to create their own forces ranging from savages with bows and spears to genetically modified (or grown) troops and bio-mechanical vehicles, from historically-based armies representing any period (including the modern or alternate Victorian eras) in recorded history to the wildest (or strangest) visions of combat in the far future taken from the players&rsquo; favorite SciFi novels, TV shows, or films<br/>New options for Overwatch order resolution, Air Strikes, and Stomp attacks by Walkers and Large Organic elements<br/>Rules for solitaire play<br/>Revised graphics for all Data Cards and informational markers, including edit-enabled blank Data Card PDF forms for players wishing to field their own unit creations.<br/>Revised game reference charts that include all of the &lsquo;basic&rsquo; To Hit, Hit Location, Terrain, Damage, Infantry Combat, and Crew Quality Test procedures and modifiers<br/>The scope and scale of combat in Strike Legion Tactical have not changed: a player&rsquo;s forces are grouped into platoons of 2 to 4 individual squad, guns, or vehicles and each player can easily handle a reinforced battalion on the tabletop.<br/><br/>",

Your goal is to have more victory points (academic notoriety) than your opponent when the draw deck runs out.<br/><br/>Dinos, Dice and Dynamite is a solitaire game designed for the 2014 Solitaire PnP contest. Each round, the player must supply and then decide which activities they and their crew (dice) will do, from finding new sites to dig, to studying fossils, to sabotaging your opponent's discoveries.<br/><br/>The player places generic cubes and six sided dice to mark these choices. The dice may give a bonus to some activities, but they might also prompt a reaction from the AI controlled opponent. The player may nearly uncover a new dinosaur, only to have their work destroyed by a jealous opponent. A combination of careful planning, and riskier sabotage is needed to earn more victory points than your opponent.<br/><br/>",

Each player takes on the role of a leprechaun trying to be the first to complete their rainbow and get the Pot O' Gold - but they have to be wary of the other devious tricksters who have the same goal!<br/><br/>Pot O' Gold includes nine different cards, each of which have actions associated with them. These include seven different color cards - Red, Orange, Yellow, Green, Blue, Indigo, and Violet - that may be played sequentially to form a player's rainbow or to take an action that will help them manage their cards, get new cards, or attack another player. There are also two special cards: Pot O' Gold acts as a Wild Card as well as the winning card; Leprechauns are tricksters who undo the last action played.<br/><br/>On their turns, players may play in one (or both) of two ways: to add to or to solidify their rainbow in front of them, or as an action. Hand order matters, and players must play the first card from their hand every turn; they may choose to play the second if possible. Play continues until one player has played all colors of the rainbow in order and plays a Pot O' Gold to win the game.<br/><br/>",

It does, however, turn out to be the best place to stay forever...<br/><br/>Darkness Comes is a co-operative board game that tells a story of a family trying to escape from a haunted house. The game begins quickly. The set-up is gamified as the players use their cards to create the initial situation on the board. They decide which areas are haunted and which doors are closed, how much time they need to escape, where they can find useful items, what they should do before leaving the place. Every card they play increases the tension, and strange things start to happen: Menacing shadows gather, and family members' faces disappear from photographs. All these events prepare us for the forthcoming nightmare.<br/><br/>Then the main phase of the game begins. The house tries to ensnare the characters inside or kill them. Trying to find their way out, the family members encounter many kinds of horrors. Every time it happens, they decide whether to strengthen the house, hurt themselves, or change their plans.<br/><br/>Characters co-operate and support each other by transferring love points &mdash; but sometimes they have to risk their sanity to survive. And sometimes they lose their minds. That's why the rules of the game can change. The possessed character may decide to side with the sinister house. It comes as no surprise for horror fans when the father of the family gets mad and finds the axe!<br/><br/>",

        "description": "Pick a Vowel is a 2-5 player (works best with 3) board game for families. Players move together around the board collecting letters and cards, aiming to create long and high scoring words. The first player to reach the word limit (decided at the beginning) ends the game, giving all other players one more turn.<br/><br/>There are many different strategies that can be taken, such as; &lsquo;lots of small words, a couple of long words, or go all out on completing objectives&rsquo;.<br/><br/>The great thing about Pick a Vowel is no one is left idle. Even if it isn &rsquo;t you turn, you still move around the board collecting letters and cards. This makes it especially good for younger players as often children become bored waiting for their turn.<br/>Another great aspect about the game, is the unpredictable winner. Since there are so many ways to get points, like using words which have lots of vowels, or completing heaps of objectives, by the end of the game, the winner could really be anyone.<br/><br/>Cards are one of the most important part of the game, as they are used to interact with other play ers, like stealing their letters, or stopping another player make a word, but also are used for perks, like increasing the value of vowels or allowing you to make two words in a turn.<br/><br/>Pick a Vowel has many different levels of complexity, offering a light,gentle game for children, or an intense, challenging game for adults. The use of objective cards, and letter penalties increases the difficulty dramatically. The length of the game can be adjusted by simply deciding the word limit at the beginning.<br/><br/>&quot;Very cool word game with lots of interaction, interesting twists, and very little waiting time. Makes you want to play again. Why didn't I invent this game?&quot; - Professional Game Designer and Mentor - Martin Nedergaard Anderson<br/><br/>&quot;There are choices, you stay involved, there are different strategies that can work - but it rewards longer/more difficult words&quot; - Manager of Board Games Australia<br/><br/>&quot;Easy to play, good pace, enjoyable - Competitive and encourages bad blood between players&quot; - Designer from Protospiel - Sydney 2014 &quot;<br/><br/>&quot;Fast pace, interactive, different levels of difficulty, great for all ages, can't predict the winner!&quot; - 18 year old play tester.<br/><br/>",

A complete game takes about 20 to 40 minutes to play, but it can be shortened or lengthened easily. The game is comprised of several &ldquo;rounds&rdquo; where each player utilizes his mice to draw cards from any of three cheese piles in an attempt to gather cheese.  Within the cheese piles lie cheese, traps, tools, and the dreaded cat. Each player must gather the number of cheese indicated on their &ldquo;Escape&rdquo; level card and get it transferred to their nest before the other player to win the round!<br/><br/>When a round is won, that player advances to the next highest Escape card.  The first player to finish all of their Escape cards wins the game! By removing some Escape cards the game can be shortened, or conversely adding extra Escape cards the game can be lengthened.<br/><br/>Although the concept of the game is simple enough for even youngsters to pick up quickly, the strategy and suspense behind every card flip make this an addictive game for all ages!<br/><br/>",

The resource roundel is used to control the availability of resources to the players and also to establish which player is in control of the game at any given time.<br/><br/>Each player is managing one or two IT services, where each service relies upon one application and several technical services (represented in the Stabil-IT matrix).<br/><br/>Over the course of six rounds, each player performs actions to improve the confidence in their IT services and to life-cycle them to an updated version. Each action takes one or more resources which can be technical specialists, application specialists or analysts/test specialist.<br/>At certain points in the game, stress tests are carried out to find the weakest point in the matrix which leads to a loss of confidence at that point. If there is no confidence to lose, an incident occurs.<br/><br/>Solving an incident may result in gaining permanent or temporary knowledge which you can use to reduce the resources needed for your actions or retained to give points at the end of the game.<br/><br/>",

The board is littered with many different type of &quot;Landscape&quot; tiles [house, barn, and field tiles] that inhibit movement, but also provide bonus points if a picture is captured during destruction. These tiles are placed randomly during setup. Road tiles are also included and provide bonuses to movement.  Road tiles are placed either according to scenario rules or by each player in turn order.<br/><br/>The tornadoes are spawned and moved via the &quot;Storm Deck&quot; which is built during setup. The game's speed is dictated by the number of spawning cards, with the higher ratio equaling a faster game. Tornadoes dissipate randomly via dice and time track mechanic.<br/><br/>At the end of the game, players count only money on hand. The player with the most wins, ties are broken in favor of the player with the most pictures taken.<br/><br/>",

On the back side, you find a piece of track to enlarge your circuit to three sheets, connecting one track part with the pit lane and one with the curve of the basic game.<br/><br/>New options are saving fuel and tires by driving over matching symbols on the track.

Veggie Sales is a simultaneous action game where players try to fulfill, as quickly as possible, their shopping cards with a variety of vegetables. The player, who collects the most vegetables in order to fulfill their shopping cards, becomes the happiest veggie shopper and wins the game!<br/><br/>How to play:<br/>Players start the game with a certain number of Shopping Cards in hands and share a basket of random Vegetable Tokens in the center of the table. The youngest player shouts out &ldquo;Veggie Sales!&rdquo; and everyone tries to manipulate the Vegetable Tokens in the Shopping Basket so as to match the compositions on their Shopping Cards. There are three things players can do: <br/>(1) put ONE Vegetable Token into the basket, <br/>(2) remove ONE Vegetable Token from the basket, or <br/>(3) swap exactly TWO Vegetable Tokens in and out of the basket.<br/>If a player thinks that they can fulfill one of their Shopping Cards in hand, they immediately play the card in front of them, grab the Shopping Basket, and perform exactly one of the three possible actions to fulfill the card they have just played. If it successfully matches the card, they place the Shopping Card, face-up, beside them as their scores, and return the basket to the center of the table. After that they give exactly one Shopping Card in hand to any one player next to them. However, if they fail to match the card, they must turn over one of their scored card (if any), face-down, and return the basket to the center of the table, and other players may try to play cards and grab the basket for themselves.<br/>The game ends immediately when one player has got rid of all their cards in hand. All players count the total vegetable icons shown on their scored Shopping Cards. Whoever collects the most vegetable icons wins.<br/><br/>",

Unlike the blood-craving vampires of Western myth that turn into flying bats, Chinese vampires do not transform and their bodies become stiff. The only way for them to travel is to hop and that&rsquo;s why they are called hoppers (well, that&rsquo;s why I call them that).<br/><br/>Hoppers is a 4 to 9-player action/dexterity party game for all ages. In the game, players are guardians of the realm and each holds a power stone that gives them the ability to travel into the Mystic Forest. Player must beware, however, because one of the players may be a demon in disguise and hold the evil Hopper Stone.<br/><br/>Each game of Hoppers is played over the course of up to five rounds. In each round, players attempt to pass a dexterity challenge in the Mystic Forest and only successful players can examine the stones of power. When a player&rsquo;s matching power stone is found, the player has the ability to capture the Hopper Stone and win the game. Otherwise, the game ends in the Hopper&rsquo;s Way and all guardians disappear into the dark of the Mystic Forest.<br/><br/>",

It was released at Tokyo Game Market 2014 as a set of 4 postcards, 3 of which are the Chepy playing cards (6 per postcard) which must be cut out prior to playing. The last card is a double sided rules card. All cards are Japanese language only, unlike the dual language (ENG and JPN) Shephy.<br/><br/>The rules are basically the same as Shephy, but scaled down slightly. The player starts with one sheep in their field, and must manage the event cards presented to you in order to accumulate ONE HUNDRED sheep in the field before you go through the deck of event cards three times.<br/><br/>The sheep deck consists of values 1, 3, 10, 30, and 100; at the start of the game, you place a 1 sheep card in your field, then shuffle the event cards and lay out three cards to form your hand. On a turn, you choose one card, carry out its effect, then refill your hand to three cards. Event cards might duplicate existing sheep cards, add new ones, swap one value of sheep for another, remove sheep, etc. Play through the deck until you have no cards in hand, then shuffle the event cards.<br/><br/>If you go through the deck three times without having at least one 100 sheep card in the field or if at any point in the game you have no sheep in the field, then you lose.<br/><br/>",

Reveal the last card for the trump suit. Suit must be followed if possible. Tricks are won by the highest trump played, else by the highest card of the suit led.<br/><br/>A point is awarded for winning three tricks. On the other hand, if every player wins one trick, whoever won the first trick gets a point. If neither condition is met, no points are awarded. Play to six points.<br/><br/>",

        "description": "Castle Men 4X is a 4X micro-game set in a fantasy world.  Players are vying to create the most successful civilization on a small map made from just 9 cards. As each card contains multiple territories of different terrain types, the map varies from game to game.<br/><br/>Players must explore the terrain on the map, expand their settlements by exploiting local resources and of course try and exterminate their opponent.<br/><br/>To help their civilization grow they can gain knowledge which is traded in for developments that impact upon game play.  18 different developments are available to help, on just 9 cards. Each development a player chooses deprives them and their opponent of another alternative one.<br/><br/>Player actions are selected on a roundel, with a range of actions available each turn, although repeat actions are not possible.  Each completed journey round the roundel completes a season of the year and the different seasons confer benefits and responsibilities upon players that affect the progress of the game.<br/><br/>Players win by being the first to accrue a specified number of  victory points.  Victory points are achieved through gaining developments and building developing settlements.<br/><br/>All components for play can fit in a 2oz tobacco tin making it highly portable, and files include labels for the lid of such a container.<br/><br/>",

The previous games in the series were ZOU in 2012 (an adaptation of MOW) and Kizz-Kizz in 2013 (an adaptation of Okiya).<br/><br/>Yakkaz is similar to Yahtzee, but instead of regular dice, five sides have images of the Tootizz, guardians of Le Grand Massif (see the Tootizz story).  The sixth side has an image of Zhinzho the dragon.<br/><br/>On a turn, players roll the dice up to three times and mark one (or optionally two) results on a score sheet. If more than one Zhinzho is rolled, they can be used to improve an already marked score; each line can be improved only once. The highest score at the end of the game wins.<br/><br/>",

Fortunately for this group of disgruntled trolls they happen to be quarreling in a field full of boulders. In Me Throw Rock players play the role of trolls who happen to be in the thick of an argument that can only be settled by throwing large rocks at each other. The player who has the best accuracy wins the game!<br/><br/>Me Throw Rock is an eighteen card dexterity game where players throw a set of six double sided rock cards at target troll cards over a series of rounds. Every round a single target troll card is thrown onto the floor. Each player takes a turn throwing their own colored rock cards at the target card until all their cards have been thrown. The player who has the majority of three rock cards that are the closest to the target wins the round. The winner of the round collects the target card and any of the three closest cards that are showing the split side up.<br/><br/>The games ends after all five target troll cards have been collected or if a player has one or less rock cards to throw. After the game has ended the players must tally their points by looking at the cards they have collected. Each target troll card collected scores three points and each rock card of the players color scores one point. The player with the most points wins the game. Ties go to the player who has collected the least number of rock cards of their opponents color.<br/><br/>Me Throw Rock is designed to be played on the floor with a space of about 8 to 10 feet in length. However, Me Throw Rock is not limited to play on a floor and can be played on any surface with a suitable flat target area such as a table or bed.<br/><br/>",

He gets a dance board which he has to fill with tiles of five different colors. The tiles have different length and shape so each player has to think fast and grab the tiles that he needs before his opponents take them. The first player to fill his board gets 5 points but beware of mistakes! If you used a tile that you were not allowed to or a tile was wrongly placed the player receives penalty points. Additional points are scored for unfilled hexes on opponents boards.<br/><br/>The first player to score 25 points is declared the best choreographer and wins!<br/><br/>",

In all three games, whoever collects the most cards wins.<br/><br/>In the first game, shuffle the cards with the capitals face-up, then take turns naming the country depicted on the card. Guess right and you claim the card; otherwise, remove the card from the game.<br/><br/>In the second game, deal the cards out evenly among the players with the capitals face-up. On a turn, you hold one of your cards capital side-out toward your left-hand opponent. If he can name one of the countries adjacent to the depicted country, he claims the card; if not, the next opponent in clockwise order can try to do so. Remove the card from the game if no one guesses correctly.<br/><br/>In the third game, deal ten cards capital side-up to each player. On a turn, choose two cards and hold them out to your left-hand opponent. If he can guess which country is larger in size or population (depending on what choose at the start of play), he claims both cards; otherwise, remove the card from the game.<br/><br/>",

At the end of the three moves, you must reach the accessory tile. The first player to find a solution calls out and demonstrates it, receiving one diamond if correct.

The rules were honed across nearly two years of testing. The board shape and core mechanics were inspired by ancient Greek geography and warfare. Greece has many narrow valleys and mountain passes, and sometimes the only way to defeat an enemy force was to collide with them head-on and literally push them off the field. This othismos (&ldquo;shoving&rdquo;) is thought to have been the critical phase of most battles between hoplite armies, who were the heavy infantry that dominated ancient Greek war for four centuries. In this game, you command a Greek city&rsquo;s hoplite soldiers who must force their way through enemy lines. Your troops can push or rout those who would block their way across the narrow battlefield. Coordinate attacks with your ally to secure victory, but make sure to watch your flanks!<br/><br/>",

Each player arranges his hand and lays down any pairs he has been dealt.<br/><br/>Player to the dealer's left begins by drawing a card from the dealer's hand.  If he can make a pair, he lays them down.  Play then moves clockwise, the player on the left taking a card from the player on his right.  The game continues until all the cards have been paired.  If a player has used all his cards he waits until his opponents have played all of theirs.  The first player to use all his cards receives a bonus of five points, but his pairs can still be captured.<br/><br/>Using the points on each card the scores are then added up and recorded.  The first player to reach a score of 50 or the player with the highest score over 50 is the winner.<br/><br/>A Superman card has no value alone.  However, it can be used to (a) cancel out a pair of minus cards, (b) capture an opponents pair, (c) protect one of the player's own pairs.  It is placed on top of the pair it has captured, cancelled out, or protected from being captured.  Players must wait their turn before using a Superman card.

(The weather reduced flight operations considerably.)<br/><br/>The surrounding of the German 6th Army in Stalingrad had happened, and in the game von Kluge must try to (irretrievably) withdraw as many panzer divisions as possible to send to Stalingrad, while stopping Zhukov's attempt to retake Rzhev and erase the salient it was in.<br/><br/>The Russians get points for any victory point cities they take, for clearing out German defense zones along the front line, and for eliminating German units, outright or in exchanges.<br/><br/>This heretofore little-known battle was the subject of Col. (rtd.) David Glantz's revelatory book, Zhukov's Greatest Defeat.  Historically, the Russians took horrendous casualties and achieved little, other than preventing panzer divisions from being transferred south, to try to help save 6th Army surrounded in Stalingrad.<br/><br/>",

England has been at peace for a decade, the family and guests are at the Hall for a evening meal, the cook has prepared a delightful supper, and the staff have arranged the summer&rsquo;s mauve and white flowers in crystal vases in impecible fashion. Everything is simply tip-top ... except for the still-warm body found on the grounds of Woodperry Hall. Was it murder or suicide? Was it simply an accident, or something far more sinister? Oh, without a doubt it&rsquo;s murder alright, and now Oxford City Police detectives will arrive and dramatically solve the case. Who will be discovered to have commited the crime?<br/><br/>A Very English Murder: Murder at Woodperry Hall is a three- to eight-player murder mystery game set in the fictional village of Thornbury, near Oxford, England in 1955. It is a narrative game where players cooperatively construct a story about a murder that takes place by answering questions and trying to appear innocent. Each player assumes the role of a character who is frequently found in classic English murder mystery novels. Every turn, one player assumes the role of an Oxford City Police Detective to question the other players who, in turn, build a case against each other to make sure another character is responsible for the murder that took place. At the end of the game, the Detective will solve the crime and&mdash;in dramatic fashion&mdash;reveal who the murderer is. Will you turn out to be the one who committed the murder?<br/><br/>",

Along the way, we have, among others, views of Pittsburgh, Omaha, &quot;surprise by savage Indians&quot;, &quot;wild heard of buffalloes&quot;, &quot;railroad bridge over the Platte river,&quot; Cheyenne, Green River, Humboldt Valley, &quot;Trukee&quot; Valley, Sierra Nevada and Sacramento. The text is titled &quot;Trip from New-York to San Francisco by the Union Pacific Rail Road. A new illustrated Travel-game with 45 stations, 1 dy, 12 cars and 12 numbers charts&quot;. The text is written in German and English and explains the game and the views. The cover of the game box (19x24) has a lovely colored litho view of two women joining hands across the American Continent, one representing America and the other Asia.<br/><br/>(Trivia: It is very likely that this game was also sold by the on-train concessionaire (&quot;news butchers&quot;) on the trans-continental trains of the Union Pacific, just as promotional picture booklets were sold showing the scenic views along the route -- in other words, a tourist's memento).<br/><br/>",

Each unit can only capture units that are as strong as it or weaker, except that some units can &quot;trump&quot; stronger units: a trebuchet is the only unit that can kill a dragon. Many units have unique powers, like the ability to move twice or to attack from a distance.<br/><br/>",

        "description": "The Kenya Safari Game is a roll-and-move game that simulates a traveler exploring the sights and tourist attractions of Kenya.  Players start from a pre-chosen base in the capital city of Nairobi.  They draw a variety of different-colored cards, each of which represents a different type of site or tourist attraction they must visit or an animal they must photograph on safari.  They then roll two dice each turn to move around the board by a roads, trails, trains and airplanes to visit the required locations.  The first player to complete all their photography assignments and see all their designated sights returns to his or her Nairobi base and is declared the winner.  Special rules allow players to take flights or extra turns when rolling doubles.<br/><br/>Although this is primarily a roll and move game an element of strategy is introduced by the fact that players must visit a variety of sites in a variety of areas and may travel by various routes.  Players who plan the most efficient routes from place to place may gain an advantage.<br/><br/>",

        "description": "Sicilia is a mid-weight strategy game for 2-5 players, with a 6-player expansion.<br/><br/>During the middle ages, Sicily was the melting pot of its day. Greeks, Italians, Arabs, French, and Spanish all mixed together on the island. Rarely did the ruling king live on the island. Instead, leaders, such as barons and dukes, were appointed to govern the island.<br/><br/>One such leader, the Baron Beneamato, governed the territory of Sicily. In his advancing years, he wanted to ensure that his people were governed by a good leader&mdash;a person they trusted and loved. So rather than pass his sovereignty to his evil son, he proclaimed that the people would decide who would become the next ruler. The island would now be governed as a democracy.<br/><br/>The players in this game are potential candidates for the throne, trying to earn a majority of support, by influence, strategy, or force. You must also learn to avoid or control the Innominato (the un-named), a secret society predating the modern Mafiosi, who will thwart any ruling power.<br/><br/>You all start out in your home village with minimal support and very little transportation. You must work to increase your transportation speed, out guess your fellow players to earn more support of the people, avoid duels with other players, and work out your strategy to succeed. Will you quickly try to grab the smaller villages through education? Or prove your dedication to larger villages with food and wine? Will you earn the trust of a certain region or try to please everyone in all regions? Or will you spend your resources for the benefits of Potenza cards?<br/><br/>",

        "description": "LEXI Card Game is a new word game. There are 55 cards in one deck of LEXI Card Game. There are 52 letter cards; the number of each letter of the alphabet in the deck is according to the frequency of usage for each letter in the English language. There are two WILD cards which may be substituted for any letter of the alphabet. There is one (shortened) Rules/Score card.<br/><br/>At the beginning of the game, the players set a goal of whatever score to be reached to win. (The winning score may be 100, 200, 500, etc.) Every player takes turns dealing. All players get nine cards each at the beginning of the game. One card is flipped open next to the deck, and both are placed at the center of play. The first player draws from either the deck or the opened card, but not both. He may lay down one or more words to be scored at the end of the round; he does not have to lay down any words. When this player is done, he discards one card. Play moves to the next player. All players will take turns playing. When it is a player's turn, he either draws one card from the deck or pick up card(s) from the open discarded pile. If the player draws from the discarded pile, he has to pick up all the cards from the card he wants to the latest discarded one and take it (or them) into his hand. This player has to play the bottom (oldest discarded) card he picks up and spell a word with it. He can, but does not have to spell words with the rest of the letter cards he picks up. When this player is done laying down words in front of him, he must discard one card. A player may add to an existing word he has laid down in a previous turn--by adding a prefix or a suffix--to form a longer word. For example: A player has laid down &quot;ALL&quot; in one turn, and has &quot;E&quot;, &quot;R&quot; in his hand. In a subsequent turn, he picks up &quot;T&quot;. This player may add to the existing word, &quot;ALL&quot; and form &quot;TALLER&quot;. A player may only play and add to his own words and no one else's. For words to count toward a score, the words must be laid down in front of the player during his turn. If the words are not laid down when the round ends, those letters (forming a word) left in a player's hand will not count toward scoring. Moreover, one (1) point will be deducted for every letter left in a player's hand. All players must have taken at least one turn to spell words before the round may be ended. Only the player whose turn it is may end the round. To end a round, a player must use all his cards to spell one or more words, except one which must be discarded. Scores are added up according to the Summation principle:<br/><br/>1 letter word = 1 point; 2 letter words = 1+2= 2 points; 3 letter words = 1+2+3= 6 points; 4 letter words = 1+2+3+4= 10 points; 5 letter words = 1+2+3+4+5= 15 points; 6 letter words = 1+2+3+4+5+6 =21 points, etc.<br/><br/>The players play a new round and add up the scores. Rounds are played until the set score is reached. The first player to reach the set score wins.<br/><br/>",

        "description": "The twelfth and final portion of the North Africa collection is ASLComp AFRIKAKORPS: El Guettar Stakes and it brings those pretty green American bonus counters into play with actions that all take place in Tunisia. Almost all of the scenarios depict American troops in action (a couple depict British units vs. Germans) and once again the overlay collection is used to create one interesting battlefield after another in ways that just cannot be done with geomrphic boards. This set of 8 scenarios includes the namesake Battle of El Guettar, as well as action alongthe Gafsa-Gabes road and one of the final encounters of the War in North Africa, outside the gates of Tunis.<br/><br/>",

        "description": "FRONTIER POST, LIBYAN-EGYPTIAN BORDER, 12 JUNE 1940: The frontier wire was some 12 feet wide and 16 feet high; the Italians had built it along the Libya-Egypt border from the coast near Sollum to the oasis of Jarabub, 150 miles to the south. On 12 June patrols from the 11th Hussars and the KRRC quickly breached the wire. Attacking at dawn and out of the rising sun, the Hussars surprised and confused the Italian defenders, who watched as their machinegun posts were suppressed by British mortar fire and their tankettes destroyed by British armored cars and close-range machinegun fire from Vickers tanks. These raids continued through the rest of June and July of 1940, until the British 7th Armoured Division was recalled for a refit in Egypt. The raids destroyed many Italian vehicles, considerable supplies of ammunition and petrol, and significant water storage. Twenty-five Italian officers (including a general of engineers) and five hundred other ranks were captured. This series of raids also marked the beginning of an overall erosion of Italian morale, as the inadequacy of their tank armor and the scarcity of effective antitank weapons and ammunition became apparent....<br/><br/>ASLComp AFRIKAKORPS: Frontier War is a detailed new ASLComp VARIANT that tells the story of the War in North Africa. It's about time the desert warfare goodness that was spawned by Hal Hock's seminal work TOBRUK back in 1975... was brought to the gaming tables of ASLers. And now it is, in a big way.<br/><br/>The eighth portion of the set-piece is ASLComp AFRIKAKORPS: Frontier War and depicts the British push forward during the blazing hot summer of 1940. Italy had the meatballs to declare war on Great Britain as Mussolini decided to join his fellow dictators and gorge on Europe's spoils. Il Duce failed to take into account the fighting spirit of Tommy Atkins and his commanders. The result was anything but a massive offensive by numerically superior Italian soldiers in the Western Desert. Instead, British probes became attacks. Attacks became offensives. And the entire affair became a major problem for Mussolini's Italy and dreams of more easy conquests on the African Continent. This batch of 8 scenarios takes things from the frontier raid of 12 June 1940 through Graziani's offensive and the &quot;first haul of booty of the desert war&quot; along the coastal road west of Alam el Dab, Egypt some months later.<br/><br/>You receive a set of 8 scenarios, all depicting actions from the exciting offensive, rife with combined-arms actions. And yes, these are aimed at playability. Slap them down, bang them out, do it again. And again. Please do a little hooting and hollering while you're at it... at least when you roll 'snakeyes' (or the other guy rolls 'boxcars').<br/><br/>",

Rommel depended on this lifeline for his supplies, well known to the Allied command. For the first time, British fighter-bombers roar overhead looking for prey. As the Gazala positions crumbled, Rommel pushed his men and machines ever eastward along the Via Balbia, in pursuit of what he thought was a beaten enemy. Rommel's best troops raced forward in the van. Italian units followed behind. The Desert Fox knew the enemy was in disarray. Rommel also knew British supply lines and the ability to move units into the front line improved with every retrograde mile they retreated. The Italian XX Corps began moving east along the Via Balbia late on June 30, heading for participation in Rommel's last ditch attempt to reach Alexandria. Their trip would not go without incident as the British suddenly appeared from the desert flank, precipitating a vicious firefight. Their tormentors were units of the British 7th Motorized Brigade, sent forward to buy time for a new line to be formed at El Alamein. The quick-hitting unit handled the Italians roughly before pulling up stakes and moving off. The resulting Axis losses were not serious in terms of manpower. They were in terms of the time bought by tying up the coast road...<br/><br/>ASLComp AFRIKAKORPS: Along the Via Balbia is a detailed new ASLComp VARIANT that tells the story of the War in North Africa.

        "description": "Don't Be That Guy is a casual party-style card game which highlights the annoying natures of other people. Each card presents a situation that is found by most people to be irritating (Examples: Driving slowly in the left lane, Teaching someone's child to swear, etc).<br/><br/>Game play is as follows: (Normal Rules)<br/>One player reads the card and shows it to the other players. <br/>Each player votes to see which player is most likely to be guilty of this bad habit. The person with the most votes is &quot;That Guy&quot; and receives the card. The first person who hits 7 cards loses, as the game is called &quot;DON'T be that guy&quot;.<br/><br/>Alternate Rules:<br/>For groups where people are not as familiar with each other, before the first card is read, each player chooses a famous person (real or fictional, male or female, etc) and plays as that person for the rest of the game.<br/><br/>",

        "description": "Long ago at the beginning of time, there existed only the Wombatonians and the One Wombat. The One Wombat gained his power by draining it from the Wombatonians. Eventually the Wombatonians launched their attack on the One Wombat to save themselves. In the end, the Wombatonians created six weapons called the Wombat Stones. When they used the weapons, the One Wombat split into many pieces, although its consciousness survived. The Wombat Stones became lost in six different pieces of the One Wombat. Eventually, these pieces became the planets we now know as Jupiter, Mars, Venus, Saturn, Neptune, and Earth. As time went on life began to grow inside them.<br/><br/>Every One Hundred Wombatonian Years a tournament is held, Wombat Combat. The evil Combat Croc has won the tournament for the past nine centuries--except suffered failure in the last Wombat Combat Tournament to the warrior known as West Wombat. Combat Croc ordered the Crocodan horde to attack the Island known as Australia on Earth. The horde raided and injured most of West Wombat's fellow warriors, including his Wombat Masters. This enraged West enough to re-enlist in this centuries tournament. He was not alone. Marauder Maus, Kaolin, and Major Waylin Bear, who was in search of his missing subordinate, Elizabeth Emu, were also following right behind West Wombat seeking revenge, and to compete in the next Wombat Combat tournament at the same time. But unbeknownst to West Wombat and the warriors, the tournament was a ruse, a diversionary trap set by the Combat Croc in an attempt to break the rules set forth by the Wombatonians, and in rescuing Elizabeth, Combat Croc's scheme was thwarted and the Combatants prevailed.<br/><br/>In retaliation Combat Croc has scheduled an unsanctioned tournament on Earth. He seeks revenge and to claim all Wombat Stones so that he may take the place that the One Wombat once held.<br/><br/>Each player is dealt one Wombatant and a Wombat Stone. Both of these cards will be laid face-up on the table in front of the player who holds them. Each Wombatant has a certain amount of hit points they can absorb before they are defeated. As attack cards are laid in front of Wombatants, the points will be deducted from the hit point total until they are expended. The object of the game is to use your Wombatant to take the Wombat stones from all the other Wombatants in the game.<br/><br/>Each player will be dealt five cards from the Combat deck. On their turn, a player has the option to play an Attack card against any opposing player, or to lay a Counter card against the Attacks already played against them. After playing an Attack or a Counter, the player draws another card from the Combat deck. When a player's hit points are consumed, their player is out, and the last Wombatant to Attack them takes their Wombat Stone. All of the Combat cards in a defeated player's hand or before them are placed in the bottom of the Combat deck.<br/><br/>The Wombatant who earns all of the Wombat Stones wins!<br/><br/>",

Each player also has a single Dark Secret that can give a massive amount of points toward winning the game.<br/><br/>Goal: The first player to reach the point total on the &quot;Premise&quot; wins the game. Premise cards included have 10, 20 and 30 point goals, though the 10 point goal tends to be an hour long game by itself.<br/><br/>",

        "description": "User summary:<br/>カミムスビ (Kamimusubi) is a middle-ware game, to be used with other Trading Card Games (TCGs). This game is intended to let cards fight each other. You can play Kamimusubi as a stand-alone game, but by adding other TCG's cards as an extension deck, it is possible to produce a variety of play. The cards which are lying idle in your house get ready to fight for a battlefield never seen before. Let's create the strongest deck with your TCG cards!<br/><br/>You play a card from your hand and pay cost and send a character to the battlefield, like in the card game &quot;San Juan&quot;. When you pay higher costs for your character, you can put an expansion card on the top of a character card, thereby transform a character itself into an expansion card.<br/><br/>Kamimusubi is a 2-player game and has 36 cards in the deck. Players let characters fight, and the winner is the first player to cause direct damage on their opponent five times.<br/><br/>The game uses artwork by the designer but also free artwork from an open source video game, ジュエルセイバー (Jewel Savior). The publishers of the video game wanted the widest possible use for their work, so turned it into open source. The artists for the video game are listed on their website.<br/><br/>Publisher's summary:<br/>カミムスビは「異なるＴＣＧ同士を戦わせることを目的とした、ミドルウェアゲーム」です。<br/>これ単体でも遊ぶことが出来ますが、他のＴＣＧのカードを拡張デッキとして追加することで、多彩な遊び方を生み出すことが可能です。<br/>あなたの家に眠るカード達がまだ見ぬ戦場を求めて張り切っています。<br/>目指せ、ＴＣＧ界最強のデッキ！<br/><br/>サンファン方式で、手札を捨ててコストを支払いキャラクターを戦場に出します。キャラクターはさらにコストを支払うと拡張カードを上に乗せることが出来ます。それによって拡張カードに変身します。<br/>そして、キャラクター同士で戦闘を行い、先にプレイヤーへ5回直接ダメージを与えた方が勝利します。<br/><br/>",

Each player secretly belongs to one of the five Factions, with the goals of dominating the most locations on the City Board, and slaying the agents of factions with which they have a Vendetta.<br/><br/>Players take turns placing cards from their hands onto the limited slots at the various board locations. Each card belongs to a different faction, and has special abilities which can: add new agents to a location, transform agents from one faction into another, trigger a combat vote, make an accusation against another player, and more. Any player can play a card from any faction on their turn, thereby manipulating their enemies into doing their dirty work for them. A Calendar of Auguries tracks the cycles of the sun and moon, triggering a location's bonus ability when the proper faction card is played.<br/><br/>",

        "description": "From the publisher's website:<br/><br/>Ground Pounders is a card game of STAR CORPS combat.  It simulates the battles of the Corporate-Colonial Wars of the late 22nd Century.  It simulates those battles on a scale much larger than the STAR CORPS miniatures rules normally allow, with most Force Cards representing a Company (which is 4-10 squads).<br/><br/>User description<br/>The game is played with large Force Cards face up in front of each player. Each Force Card has both a Victory Point and Hit Point value. Once enough damage has been done to a card to equal or exceed it's Hit Points, the unit is eliminated and the player who eliminated it gains it's Victory Point value.<br/><br/>The players are also dealt a hand of smaller Action Cards which are not revealed when dealt. Action Cards are generally played to inflict damage to enemy units, although some activate other effects such as healing friendly units or allowing a player to draw additional cards.<br/><br/>Games may be played either until a player has reached a set Victory Point total, or until only one player has units remaining.<br/><br/>",

These stats are number of actions, spaces moved per movement action, dice modifier, rerolls, and how many gifts can be carried. The players can deliver the &quot;nice way&quot; which takes more actions but is a sure thing or the &quot;naughty way&quot; which uses only one action per delivery, but requires you to draw from the Naughty Deck and pass the obstacles on the card through dice rolls.<br/><br/>Santa Showdown includes four different enemy figures that affect game play, forty single-use gadgets the Santas can employ to help them on their deliveries, and a modular board to allow for replay and experimenting with which mode of play works for you.<br/><br/>",

        "description": "In In the Loop, you are a product producing company who must meet customer demands. Navigating through resource mines and unpredictable markets will involve making economic, social, political, and environmental trade-offs. You will have to make difficult strategic decisions: should you collaborate with your competitors, invest in mining new materials, or change your business model?<br/><br/>In the Loop gamifies the complex, global supply chain in less than 90 minutes. As the game unravels, players will learn about product lifecycle as well as resource efficient and effective solutions. And they will be ready to come up with their own resourceful strategies.<br/><br/>How it works:<br/>In the Loop is a turn-based game. Players roll dice to move around the board in order to collect material tokens needed to make their products. Event cards occur at intervals throughout the game and hinder or help players' abilities to obtain material tokens. Players can choose to purchase strategy cards to combat these events. The first player to make three products wins!<br/><br/>",

        "description": "Woodrow Wilson brought peace to war-torn Europe in December 1916, but many French politicians believed they had been robbed of the fruits of victory. Alsace remained under German rule, and in September 1940 the French Third Army surged over the border to recapture the symbolic city. The Second Great War had begun.<br/><br/>Spearheaded by well-equipped armored divisions and backed by plentiful air support, the French pressed hard against the Bavarian First Army tasked with defending this sector of the border. Would they be able to take Strasbourg quickly to show the French people that victory was assured in this new war, or would their offensive bog down into a replay of the First Great War&rsquo;s horrors?<br/><br/>Alsace 1940 is a variant set of scenarios for our Alsace 1945 game, set in the same alternative-history background as our Second World War at Sea games. It is not a complete game: ownership of Alsace 1945 (and only Alsace 1945) is necessary to play all of the scenarios included. Alsace 1940 also includes 140 laser-cut and mounted playing pieces.<br/><br/>(from Avalanche Press website)<br/><br/>",

Whenever major mining equipment breaks down your team gets the call.<br/><br/>Your mission: repair the damaged reactor core and clear the base of any alien presence before it&rsquo;s too late.<br/><br/>Alien Overrun is a cooperative game that combines exploration, resource gathering, press-your-luck dice combat, and an escalating countdown timer. Your team has taken remote control of the robotic mining rigs of the  mining facility and uploaded custom software that will customize your rig. Now all you have to do is pilot your rig to the reactor core. The only problem is the countless aliens that have overrun the facility and feed on the very radiation you seek to eliminate. Lucky for you that the facility is rich with resources, workshops, repair facilities, and even an armory that you can utilize to upgrade your rig but each facility has a different layout so you will need to explore to find them. Once you feel like you have all of the upgrades you need you can move on to the ultimate showdown with the alien queen herself. But be quick as the core will soon go critical and destroy the facility.<br/><br/>Move your pawn to explore the facility and uncover the random hex-based board. Draw encounter cards to find out what alien threat lurks in the dark. Roll dice and press-your-luck to defeat the aliens. Use your rig's special abilities to help your friends. And discover powerful alien artifacts to help you defeat the alien queen.<br/><br/>",

        "description": "In On Air, players are building their own TV Network. They start new programs, upgrade and customize them, hire stars, use their staff in their optimal way. Acquiring fans and researching the audience is key to getting the best ratings. Ads and product placement are extremely important for making money but they shouldn't be overused because the viewers might get annoyed and change the station. The most delicate thing is to know where to stop your best TV programs. They can go into the archives at their peak and always be remembered or they can be prolonged for profit but go down by their age and be forgotten forever.<br/><br/>On Air is an action selection, resource and hand management board game that lasts for a certain amount of rounds. Each player has three slots for TV programs. Morning, Afternoon and Evening (Primetime). At the end of each round audience cards for the three time frames are revealed. Each one has different requirements for content. If a player&rsquo;s TV program at that time frame fits their requirements the player win their attention and score ratings.<br/><br/>The players fight for victory points. Victory points are accumulated in three ways.<br/><br/>1.    Rating scored during the game<br/>2.    Points for archived program<br/>3.    Points for secret objectives<br/><br/>Each game of On Air will feel different. Players choose their role at the beginning of the game. There are 4 roles with not only unique skills but unique mechanics that change the game. Also, every role itself has several completely different ways to play.<br/><br/>The game comes with plenty of staff cards that also break the standard rules of the game. Each card has multiple ways of using it, so players can customize their style even further.<br/><br/>Every program can be fully customized. For example, you can start a children puppet show but if you want you can change it by adding drama and 16+ content. Later on you could even change the type from being TV series to being a reality show or even a game show. You can get stars for the show or put a lot of absurd product placement in it.<br/><br/>Whatever you do, your TV Network is all up to you!<br/><br/>",

        "description": "Chess married to Dice. The game consists of 8 dice, 4 in white and 4 in black. The dice are all identical, having the 6 chess pieces on each die.. You need a chess-set and board to play this game.<br/><br/>Four games are described:<br/>Game 1: Kamikaze. Each player rolls 3 dice and may move any chess piece on the board that is shown on the dice. If a pair is rolled you may move that piece and throw again for a second move. If a triple is rolled, any piece can be moved and you get a further throw. If a player is placed in check, the opponent has up to three rolls to escape. If he fails to do so, it is Chuck-A-Mate.<br/><br/>Game 2: Pair-Fect. Same as above but only two dice are rolled. A pair rolled lets you move any piece. After a pair, the same player rolls again, even if his opponent is in check.<br/><br/>Game 3: Pair-Less. Four dice are rolled. Pairs in this game do not count and cannot move.Triples allow any piece to be moved and a second throw. If four of a kind are rolled, you may take any piece from your opponent and roll all the dice again. If four Queens are rolled, that is automatically Chuck-A-Mate.<br/><br/>Game 4: Four-Fun. Same as Game 3 but you may move any piece showing on the four dice that you roll. There are no extra moves. You may use the doubling die that is included in the game which works like in Backgammon. This is only sensible if you are playing for points over a set number of games.<br/><br/>",

You do this by collecting 10 points of evidence before the other team.<br/><br/>Solving Crimes requires acquiring cards through draw actions, and special locations you can shape your hand of cards to aid you in the crimes to be solved all over town.<br/><br/>The city map has locations like The Docks, and The International District where crimes go down. The City Hall, and Police Station are where you can kiss up to the Police Chief, and Police Commissioner. And there are even a couple spots where you and your buddy can go for some entertainment to get to know one another.<br/><br/>",

You were selected from an incredibly competitive and capable group of applicants, and showed an intense devotion to creating weapons worthy of legend.<br/><br/>Masamune is a game for two to four players, and takes place over the course of an academic year at Masamune Shining Forge Academy. As a pupil at Masamune Shining Forge Academy, you and your opponents will start the game with identical 12-card decks. Over the course of the game, you will forge sentient weapons called Chibis and teach them powerful special techniques to defend the Academy from attacking monsters. Alternatively, you can use Chibis to gain more powerful cards and bolster your deck.<br/><br/>Just like normal schools, Masamune Shining Forge Academy uses Exams to measure its pupils&rsquo; academic growth. Every time a new card is added to your deck, there is a chance that the next card drawn from the Academy deck will be an Exam, an intense battle staged by your instructors that lures the monsters teeming in the surrounding forest to attack the Academy! After the fifth and final Exam is completed, the school year is over, and the pupil who harvested the most monsters has won the game!<br/><br/>",

The Monarch is revealed, and points are counted. Continue playing rounds until someone reaches 20 points.<br/><br/>",

        "description": "Quick Draw is a card came designed for 2-4 players whereby each player takes on the role of a Gunfighter in the old west. Each player begins the game with 30 life points, you can use glass beads or pen and paper to keep track of the life points. You will need a standard pack of cards that have 2 jokers, and around 10-15 six sided dice (less depending on number of players).<br/><br/>The game is divided into turns with each turn being made up of 3 rounds; Quick Draw, Aim and Fire. At the start of a turn the players are dealt 10 cards and then 5 communal cards are played face up in the middle of the play area.<br/><br/>For each round the players must use three cards from their hand to make the best poker hand they can. They place each round of cards face down in front of them (3 stacks of 3 cards). The left stack are the cards used for the Quick Draw round, the middle stack is used for the Aim Round and the Right Stack is used for the Fire Round. The last remaining card is placed to the very right of the Fire Stack.<br/><br/>When all of the players have made their selection all of the stacks of cards and the remaining card are turned over, spread out and revealed for all to see, then each player places 2d6 on top of their remaining card.<br/><br/>Starting with the Quick Draw Round, the poker hands are compared, players call out their best hand in turn giving the other players the opportunity to challenge their call. Once all hands have been called, the highest scoring player performs the action from the table below using the quick draw column and cross referencing it with his poker hand, once his action has been completed the next highest highest player performs their action in the same way, this continues until all player have taken an action.<br/><br/>Play moves to the Aim round which is repeated exactly as with the quick draw round and then the Fire round is performed.<br/><br/>When the dice are rolled in the Fire Round, their result is deducted directly from the player to the left or right of the active player who may choose either one. If a player ends with a negative results, then they take the damage themselves. When instructed to add or deduct dice in the fire round, just add or deduct the dice as directed to or from the remaining card of the player.<br/><br/>",

        "description": "From the company web site...<br/>Since its inception in 2003 Twenty/20 cricket has gained in popularity making it an important part of the modern game, batting, bowling &amp; fielding techniques have become more evident in the longer versions of the game as more &amp; more T20 games are played year on year.<br/><br/>Twenty20 cricket is currently the shortest version of the game with scores in excess of 200 possible on the (mainly) batsman friendly wickets used for this format of the game.<br/><br/>Twenty20 cricket emulates to reproduce the excitement &amp; tension that draws such big crowds to the real thing, within this game are four batting grids for different types of wickets. Along with four batting &amp; four bowling grades plus a few other charts that will enable the user to replay a full game in around 30-45 minutes when the rules have been mastered, this will ensure a statistically accurate scorecard with a wealth of stats (strike rates, economy rates etc.) and hopefully a nail-biting finish to boot.<br/><br/>Rating players is a simple task &amp; although the grades are in themselves quite basic they will reproduce roughly what is achieved in real life (a T20 batsman's strike rate is regarded as a more valuable asset than his average and a bowlers economy is his main &tilde;weapon&quot;).<br/><br/>The game includes the following Ratings:<br/><br/>ICC World T20 (2014)<br/><br/>Friends Life domestic T20 (2013).<br/><br/>Big Bash league 2013-14<br/><br/>Indian Premier League 2014<br/><br/>Champions League 2013<br/><br/>Caribbean Premier League 2013<br/><br/>The game is played mainly with 2d6 and a d10, which is used occasionally.  Batters score runs by rolling a die and moving up a grid, different ones are based on the condition of the wicket.  Their starting point on the grid is based on their letter grade.  Certain points of the grid will then reference the bowler's grade - you roll a d10 to determine if the batter is out or not.<br/><br/>",

Before that, almost 20 years ago Tank brought you Pointe du Hoc, with a healthy on-site assist from Steve and Rob Pleva, plus map work (and on site research too) by Phil Nobo. The TANK is back and this time he is modeling another uniiqe Festung, the Sevastopol bastion of Stalin's Soviet Union and this is a MONSTER MODULE to do his work justice.<br/><br/>Some of the interesting details you'll receive: Russian Naval Infantry, German demolition AFVs including Kettenkrad and Bren Carrier Demo vehicles; massive Naval Gun Turrets; Concrete Trenches; German Engineers, Fortress rules; and so much more. Plus a large map with healthy-sized hexes, more terrain variants, all using official ATS nomenclature for the SSRs while avoiding 5 point type and eye-watering verbiage bloat in what will be the largest Engineer-operation ever gamed at this scale.<br/><br/>",

        "description": "For I dipt into the future, far as human eye could see,<br/>Saw the Vision of the world, and all the wonder that would be;<br/>Saw the heavens fill with commerce, argosies of magic sails,<br/>Pilots of the purple twilight dropping down with costly bales;<br/>Heard the heavens fill with shouting, and there rain'd a ghastly dew<br/>From the nations' airy navies grappling in the central blue;<br/><br/>&lsquo;Locksley Hall&rsquo;, Tennyson<br/><br/>This was the world&rsquo;s first strategic bombing campaign, the first time death rained from the skies onto an unsuspecting populace. Although seemingly ponderous and fragile, and filled with inflammable hydrogen, in 1914 the airships built by Count Zeppelin for the fatherland were a much more viable platform to bomb the English than the rickety wood and canvas aeroplanes that struggled into the sky at the time. Able to fly for days and cover thousands of miles, they were a true &lsquo;airy navy&rsquo;. However, despite the conviction of its champion, the Leader of Airships Fgtkpt Peter Strasser, this Teutonic leviathan was not a war winning weapon, and failed to deliver the hoped-for victory.<br/><br/>Any reading of the campaign will show that their greatest challenge was not the British defences, but just finding their way over the British countryside. In the dark (all raids were at night), it all looks much the same, and there were no radio beams to guide them like in WWII. This is reflected in the game; above all it is a game of navigation.<br/><br/>The Zeppelin's movement is governed by a system that limits what you can do depending on how well you know your location. The latter you can improve by using landmarks, such as towns, rivers, railroads and coastlines. Alternatively, you can ignore these and rely on dead reckoning, but then you might end up totally lost in the middle of nowhere. And of course, there's weather (clouds, rain, mist) to frustrate you too. However, there's a chance of opportunistic targets when towns randomly fail to blackout.<br/><br/>However, it wasn&rsquo;t only the Germans who faced the problems of the night. British aviation struggled to develop the technology and practice to deal with night raiders. A warning system that could enable timely launch of aeroplane patrols was never really developed, and once in the air the airman was on his own not knowing where the raider might be, or even where he was. Of course searchlights were the essential item to make the air defence viable, but the wily Zeppelin commander did all he could to avoid them, including using cloud cover.<br/><br/>This is similarly modelled in the game. The British player makes a hidden set up for his airfields before the German player comes on. Once the raiders arrive, he can launch aeroplane patrols, but the number and location is restricted by how much activity the raiders do to reveal themselves. Once launched, the patrol remains in place until a searchlit Zeppelin is in spotting range, and then it can attempt to intercept and attack. In the early scenarios aeroplane attacks can be damaging and cause a Zeppelin to scuttle home with leaks, but after incendiary ammunition was developed in mid 1916 it became sudden death to the Zeppelin.<br/><br/>The British player also has anti-aircraft guns, which are distributed over the map and controlled largely by random rolls, except for the mobile guns which the British player can place at strategic locations and use to set up ambushes.<br/><br/>Combat is largely abstracted to die rolls, but the challenge is to bring the raider to bear. As the British, you plan your fighter patrols and move mobile AA guns to defend areas or set up ambush. But reveal a unit too soon and the German player will know its there and avoid it. As the German, use stealth to avoid combat. Hide in clouds; at all costs keep out of those searchlights. But in the end, you have to brave them if you want to bomb the good targets.<br/><br/>This game offers a definitive study of that unusual campaign, with a set of 20 scenarios (each being an actual historical raid), covering the entire 4 years of the campaign. The subject matter naturally lends itself well to solitaire play as well, and specific rules for this are included.<br/><br/>",

Something is laying next to a rock with feathers on its back? &quot;Does a sea lion have feathers like a bird or does it have fur like a dog?&quot; Suddenly somebody claps their hands and the duck that was hiding behind the sea lions flies off quacking. Relieved, both of them laugh at each other after seeing that the sea lion doesn't have any feathers after all.<br/><br/>In Manimals: Loro Parque 1, players compete to find as many animals as possible with a certain characteristic. To start play, shuffle the animal cards, then spread forty of them on the table so that everyone can see them. Flip over one card, see the characteristic identified on this card, then race to pick up all animals that feature this characteristic. Once everyone has finished picking up cards, check all the cards collected to see whether anyone made a mistake; if so, that player must return the mistaken card and one correctly collected card.<br/><br/>Players repeat this process six more times, first laying out three more cards from the deck each time, then they see who has collected the most cards and won!<br/><br/>Manimals: Loro Parque 1 includes rule variants that allow for play with children as young as four.<br/><br/>",

The player playing Sweyn starts at the center of the board with 1 king and 28 vikings. Harald starts as an outer rim on the board with 1 king and 47 vikings.<br/><br/>The players take turn moving one piece at a time. Pieces are moved horizontally or vertically - never diagonally - on the board. Vikings can move as many or few spaces as they want in one direction without crossing other pieces. Kings can only move one space at a time.<br/><br/>Kings can only be beaten by a king moving to the same space. Vikings can be beaten by having enemy pieces on 2 opposite sides of it. Beaten pieces are removed from play. A piece is captured if it is surrounded by pieces on all 4 sides and at least one of these are an enemy piece.<br/><br/>Sweyn wins by having his king reach the outer rim of the board or by capturing or beating Harald. Harald wins by capturing Sweyn or by beating him.<br/><br/>",

The group asked the Captain to take the boat way out to sea, away from any lights so they could party under the stars and maybe see the Northern Lights put on a show. When the boat set out, it was a clear, pleasant evening and the sea was calm. The Captain did mention something about a possible storm front that was due to move in early the next morning.<br/><br/>For hours, the party aboard the boat had enjoyed themselves. Then someone noticed the stars had all disappeared, and the stillness of the sea was quickly turning into gale force winds. The storm front had moved in faster than anyone could have expected. A sudden microburst tore the boat to pieces, plunging you all into the sea.<br/><br/>Now you all find yourselves sitting atop a piece of the boat, bobbing in the water, somewhere in the Atlantic Ocean. Scattered in the water all around you, are pieces and debris from the boat. As it all happened so fast, the Captain had no chance to radio for help. You realize it may be some time before you are rescued, and you will need to survive until then.<br/><br/>To survive (and win the game) you must find a flotation device, a signaling device, a water source, and a food source. To find your survival tools, you will have to swim around searching the sea for floating parts. You might even have to might have to steal parts from others, or withhold parts from them to save yourself.<br/><br/>Survive being awash at sea by using deduction, hand management and memory.<br/><br/>This game uses cards as boat pieces, and floating debris. It comes with 6 player tokens to move from card (boat piece or swim card) to card. Each turn you have 2 strokes to move. As the game progresses it takes more strokes to move as the pieces are drifting further apart.<br/><br/>",

        "description": "Bezzerwizzer Musik uses the same rules as Bezzerwizzer Kompakt but contains only questions regarding music.<br/><br/>The game contains 100 cards with questions in 12 music categories and therefor only 1.200 questions - less than previous versions. Both question cards and category tokens are kept in an orange color to make them distinct from the original BEZZERWIZZER game and BEZZERWIZZER Kompakt. This means that you can mix tokens from all of the games together and create your own game with precisely the categories you like.<br/><br/>The rules below are an exact copy of the ones from Bezzerwizzer Kompakt:<br/><br/>To start with the players are divided into two to six teams. Each team can consist of one or more players. Each team then gets a bezzerwizzer token that can be used once per round (see below).<br/><br/>Now the game starts: Each team picks a token at random out of the included bag. There are 20 tokens - one for each category in the game. The token must be kept secret for the other players. The first team to go then choose either to answer a question in the category on their token or to swap with one of the other teams without knowing what they will get. If they answer the question that they end up with correctly, they will receive 3 points - a wrong answer does nothing. Scoring is kept on the included pad. This continues till all teams have answered a question. The last team will not have the possibility to swap as all other teams have used up their categories.<br/><br/>Each turn each of the teams have one opportunity to bezzerwizze one of the other teams question. This means that if the team does not answer the question correctly the team that has bezzerwizzet has a chance to answer as well. If the first team does answer correctly however the others team will have wasted their chance to bezzerwizze. The number of points you get for bezzerwizzing and answering correct is dependent on at what time you choose to do it. If you choose to bezzerwizze after the category is revealed but before the question is read aloud you will get 2 points for a correct answer. If you do it after the question has been read aloud you will only get 1 point. If the teams that bezzerwizzet can not answer correctly either the original team will receive the points.<br/><br/>The turn order then switches one place and the process starts again. If there are fewer category tokens in the bag than the number of teams when a new turn is started all of the tokens are returned to the bag.<br/><br/>The game ends when one of the teams have 20 points (the round is finished to allow other teams to reach 20 as well). Alternately you can choose to only play until the bag is empty.<br/><br/>",

Famous bridges, including the Brooklyn Bridge, cross the East River.

In addition, a fifth symbol makes it clear that this tile side can only be attached to the same tile sides (with a ferry connection).

With them you will hunt dark creatures and restore the town's resources and buildings to their former glory!<br/>In Bellwether, the card game, each player starts with five cards in hand. There are two ways to gain points: The first is to build buildings and societal organizations.  The second is to hunt dark creatures. All cards have a magical energy (color of the boarder of the card), a magical artifact, a creature to hunt, and civilization advance or building to build.  When a player chooses a study action all players gain more cards--the player choosing the action gains an extra card.  When a player chooses to hunt dark creatures he uses the magical artifact on a card or combination of cards to target the creature on a card in his hand or the top of the discard pile. Again all players have the opportunity to hunt, the player choosing the action gets bonus damage.  When a player chooses to build he chooses a combination of cards from his hand or from creatures previously killed, the player choosing to build gaining a bonus.<br/>Points are also gained by having a variety of different types of creatures killed and buildings built.  If a wizard builds or kills all of the same order, he becomes obsessed and loses points for being a dark wizard.<br/><br/>",

Many argued that golf should be available to all, not just those who could afford top flight membership fees. Bowing to this pressure the RGA have launched the 'Municipal Golf Club' initiative and challenge local authorities and councils to redevelop their suburban and brown field sites in a competition to design and build  the best golf course that will be accessible to all members of the public.<br/><br/>As Chairman of your local council parks and recreation department, you must do all you can to secure this coveted prize for your borough. However with your neighbouring districts equally driven to win, you might have to resort to underhand tactics to sabotage the opposition's plans. Perhaps by the construction of a disruptive by pass through their course or even funding a sewage treatment facility a bit too close to a fairway. Perhaps the winner may not be decided by which course is the best, but which is the least worst!<br/><br/>Eighteen new 'urban' course cards to be spliced into the original deck. New Market and Club House cards along with special cards focused on making the design of your opponents courses as difficult as possible. Not to mention those dastardly fly tippers dumping rubbish all over your lovely fairways! This second expansion for The Front Nine requires a more ruthless  attitude for the prospective golf course designer. Not for the faint hearted!<br/><br/>",

        "description": "Masters of the Tourist Trophy is a motorcycle racing sports replay game simulating the Isle of Man Tourist Trophy. The Isle of Man TT has, for many years, been regarded as the most prestigious and oldest motorcycle race in the world... and also the most dangerous motorcycle road-race in the world!<br/><br/>Summary<br/><br/>The game is typical of Lambourne's sports replay simulations in that it takes place on tables and charts (no board or counters) with minimal player decisions required.<br/><br/>The simulation has been developed to capture the confused progress of the Isle of Man mountain bike races. With drivers setting off at different times, the system is able to record both the positions on the course from a spectator viewpoint as well as keep track of the actual driver times for determining a race winner. As in the actual Tourist Trophy, crashes and mishaps are common and not all riders can be expected to finish.<br/><br/>The game includes race control sheets for six different classes of race, from the ultra-lightweight 125cc bikes to the Formula One 1200cc monsters. The famous TT sidecars are also represented in a class of their own.<br/><br/>The drivers represented and rated are drawn from the &quot;all-time greats&quot; from over 100 years of Tourist Trophy events.<br/><br/>Brief outline of the Game System<br/><br/>The race is set up on a Race Control Sheet that lists Driver Name, Driver Rating and Start Time. For each stage of the race every driver rolls two pairs of dice (red and green) to advance their progress.<br/><br/>The difference between the green &quot;+&quot; and red &quot;-&quot; dice, when added to the driver performance rating, determine whether the driver performance improves or degrades on each stage of the lap. Comparison of the driver performance ratings will reveal the order of the drivers on the circuit as they pass each checkpoint on the circuit.<br/><br/>Rolling doubles on either pair of dice may improve or degrade the driver performance rating, but rolling double &quot;6&quot; requires a further roll on Rider Mistakes or Mechanical Trouble charts. Such problems usually result in a performance loss, but can also cause retirement through a crash or serious mechanical failure. Game charts will determine the precise location of each such accident on the circuit.<br/><br/>Drivers must also elect to Pit Stop at least once during the race. This can be dome at a time decided by the player and requires a die roll and chart reference to determine the effect the pit stop has on race time.<br/><br/>At the end of the lap the cumulative performance for each of the four lap stages can be cross-referenced against the game charts to determine the lap time and average speed for each driver on the circuit.<br/><br/>",

        "description": "From Mancala World:<br/><br/>Alemungula is a mancala game played by the Wetawit (formerly spelled Wetaweat) in Ethiopia, around the towns of Asosa and Beni Sangul, towards the Sudan border. Wetawit is an ethnic group in Ethiopia and Sudan. They speak Berta, a Nilo-Saharan language. The population of this group is about 248,000.<br/><br/>The game is played mainly by youngsters, though sometimes also by adults in their leisure time. It is closely related to Um el Bagara (&quot;the cow game&quot;) which is played by the Baggara in northern Sudan. However, Alemungula offers bigger challenges because singletons may also be moved.<br/><br/>Alemungula was first described by the ethiopist Richard Pankhurst in 1971. The game was implemented by Arty Sandler for online play at igGameCenter on December 19, 2010.<br/><br/>Rules<br/><br/>Alemungula is played on a wooden board which consists of 2x5=10 holes known as tisiya alemungula (&quot;alemungula wood&quot;), while the holes are called ful alemungula. Play is begun with five stones in each hole.<br/><br/>At his turn, a player picks up all the contents of one of his holes and then distributes, one by one, the stones into the following holes, the direction depending on the hole chosen. Moves from either of a player's two left-hand holes are made in clockwise direction, moves from either of the player's two right-hand holes are made in an anti-clockwise direction, and moves from the center hole may be made in either direction. The move is finished after a single lap.<br/><br/>A singleton which is played into an empty hole of the opponent's side, that is either the last or the first hole of the opponent's row), may not be played back in the next move.<br/><br/>If the last stone is dropped in one of the opponent's holes and makes a two or a four, these stones are captured. Should one or more of the opponent's holes immediately preceding this on the line of play, also have been increased to two or four stones these will likewise be captured.<br/><br/>The captured stones are removed from the board and stored.<br/><br/>The game ends when a player has no legal move. Each player then captures the stones remaining on his side.<br/><br/>The winner is the player who captured the greater number of stones during the game. If both players captured the same number the game is a draw.<br/><br/>",

Not like a combination. This will make you end up on 2 different square.<br/><br/>Avoid the &quot;C&quot; spot, if you end your move on one,  You'll have to take another card in your hand.<br/><br/>If you end up on a square with a drawing of a dice, you have to moove your pawn by that number of square in any direction you want.<br/><br/>You can only moove one direction with the first dice no come and back. But you can choose to move back with the second dice in any direction. Or even use a different pawn for the second dice.<br/><br/>You need a 6 on one dice or on a combination of the 2 dices to put a pawn into play. You have tree role to get it otherwise you loose your turn.<br/><br/>If you got a 6 on one dice you can move your pawn by the number of the other dice. You can move on any direction.<br/><br/>You get rid of a card by ending your moove on a card symbol identical as your card. The card symbol count as a square. You can only enter that card symbol square by the exact number and by the only way make with an arrow. This is a safe square and the only place your safe to be eaten by an another player.<br/><br/>You get eaten by a player if they end up their moove on the same space as you.<br/><br/>",

The teams must get the crews to the base camp as soon as possible before they become dinner of the beast. They also need to get enough food to feed the survivors or people will start to fight for food.<br/><br/>Escape from T-Rex Island is a quick family game for 2-4 players. Each player controls three teams of survivors but only two actions may be taken each turn, so a player must choose which team to move. On the way back to the camp, players may encounter other fearsome dinosaurs like raptors &amp; pterosaurs. Players must avoid the dinosaurs while collecting food &amp; weapons dropped from the victims. Besides, players may take valuable dinosaur pictures for bonus scores.<br/><br/>In each turn, a player has two actions. You may play an action card to move a team or to take a picture if available. You may also spend an action to draw a card from the deck. But beware. No more than four cards can be held in hands.<br/><br/>The game ends when a player has 3 teams back to the camp. Then players score VPs for survivors &amp; dinosaur pictures. The player who scores most VPs wins.<br/><br/>",

        "description": "Alternate versions of some of the character cards (different backside). A single cards was given out for free with each game bought at Spiel'15, or they could be bought there as a complete set. They are sold out since.<br/><br/>The new cards include Sybille of Cleves, Charles IX de France, Charles de Solier, Mary I of England, Isabella d'Este, Isabel de Portugal, Edward VI of England, and Felipe II de Espa&ntilde;a.<br/><br/>This is what Among Meeples published as an update during their Kickstarter campaign:<br/><br/>Everybody loves promo-cards! So we naturally decided to create some for game fairs, as &quot;thank you's&quot; to the people who have helped us etc. We ended up creating 8 new Character cards and a silly alternate artwork first player card with our faces on - the last one only in 14 copies, they are for family and friends.<br/><br/>While including them in the game was not an option, we really wanted to give something more to the backers. While people attending game fairs and buying the game can get one or two cards, we now bring you the option of getting them all as PnP. We will release them all in October, but we will also add one to the PnP files each time the number of likes (thumbs) on the big Essen preview list rises by 5 (it is currently at 74 likes, currently making it the 13th most liked game - out of more than 1.000!)! You can find links to the latest PnP edition in this backers-only update.<br/><br/>The cards all substitute other cards in the game. If you play using sleeves, simply swap the original card with the promo card before playing. If you do not use sleeves, the best method is properly to wait for the original to be turned over and then substitute it with the promo card.<br/><br/>Please notice, that this &quot;Kickstarter mini-expansion&quot; is designed as promo-cards, they are not perfectly balanced or nearly as thoroughly tested as our regular cards are. We do not recommend to use them in the first few games, but for experienced players, especially the ladies add more complexity during the first rounds - and alters the tactics immensely. Have fun!<br/><br/>",

        "description": "From the publisher:<br/><br/>Our Second Great War setting is based on the premise that the First World War came to a negotiated end in late 1916, leaving the great empires intact but planting the seeds of renewed conflict a generation later.  Second World War at Sea: South American Navies looks at the involvement of Latin America's leading powers: Argentina, Brazil and Chile.<br/><br/>Each of these fleets has undergone the expansion and reconstruction allowed by strong economic growth and relative political stability - without a German economic collapse to fuel it, the Great Depression is no more than a world-wide recession. Political and especially economic ties have aligned the Latin powers with their European partners: Argentina with Italy, Chile with Britain, and Brazil with the Central Powers of Imperial Germany and Austria-Hungary, while maintaining a strong trade relationship with the United States.<br/><br/>Their fleets reflect this: the Argentine battleships have been re-built along the pattern of the Italian Conte di Cavour class, the Brazilians much like American battleships, and the Chilean ships like their British near-sisters. And each has added new ships and aircraft from those sources in pursuit of a balanced fleet. Of course, there are airships as well.<br/><br/>South American Navies is a supplement for the Second World War at Sea series, based on battles that never happened. There are 12 new scenarios in a story arc following the participation of the South American fleets in the Second Great War. It is not a complete game: Ownership of Cone of Fire (and only Cone of Fire) is necessary to play all of the scenarios included.<br/><br/>South American Navies includes 90 laser-cut and mounted playing pieces: 50 &quot;long&quot; pieces representing major warships and 40 square ones representing aircraft.<br/><br/>",

        "description": "In Taking Food From Bears, each player takes the role of a hiker trying to take food from a bear<br/><br/>At the beginning of the game, each player receives a set of seven cards, with numbers from 1 to 5, 1 whistle, and 1 bear trap. The Bear cards have values 3, 5, 7, 9, 11, 13, and 15. In a round, players attempt to steal from the target bear by playing his cards in sequence. The first player secretly looks at the target bear (the top bear card) and plays one of his number cards face up. If he plays a &quot;3&quot; card, it means that the player intends to steal 3 food from the target bear. Next players have two options: 1) look at the bear card just as the first player did and play a number card face up; or 2) play a number/whistle/bear card face down, take a multiplier (x2) card from the pool, and put the multiplier card on his face down number card.<br/><br/>After all the players played their cards, the Bear card is revealed. Beginning from the player who played the lowest card, add up the value of the number tokens. Suppose that the Bear is &quot;9&quot; and Josh played &quot;3&quot;, Becky &quot;5&quot;, Lupita &quot;2&quot;, and Samuel &quot;3&quot; with &quot;x2&quot; multiplier on it, Lupita (2), Josh (3), and Samuel (3) are entitled to receive 2, 3, and 6 (3x2) food respectively. However, Becky will receive a wound (worth -2 food at the end of the game), since she fought the bear and lost. 9 is bigger than 2+3+3 but it is smaller than 2+3+3+5. Becky triggered the Bear's wrath. Playing the Whistle card will startle the Bear and trigger each other player to be wounded, but the player playing the Whistle card will receive no food this round. Playing the Trap card will keep the player safe against being wounded, but the player playing the card will receive no food this round. The player that received the most amount of food the last round, going clockwise from the starting player, starts the next round.<br/><br/>Play continues in this manner for a specified number of rounds,or until all the food is depleted, or until one player receives 5 wounds. The player with the most food at the game end is the winner.<br/><br/>",

Taking part in historical events appearing on cards, players shape their character and develop the four cardinal virtues: courage, justice, prudence, and temperance. The winner is the player who gains the most from the historical experiences on the cards and emerges from the turbulent times with the strongest character.<br/><br/>The aim of the game is to build the character of our paratrooper. Players take part in events which let them develop their virtues: courage, justice, prudence, and temperance (C, J, P, T). Players collect appropriate sets of events and earn points for them, moving their markers on their individual virtue tracks (C, J, P, T). It is important that none of your markers falls too far behind. At the end of the game, a player&rsquo;s marker with the lowest value (the least developed character trait) is that player&rsquo;s score. The player with the best score wins.<br/><br/>GAME COMPONENTS <br/>&ndash; 1 game board<br/>&ndash; 1 paratrooper card<br/>&ndash; 52 event cards<br/>&ndash; 4 player boards, representing military service books<br/>&ndash; 20 coins or other markers<br/><br/>",

Combat is resolved by playing cards from one's battle reserve (where the cards must have been previously placed in anticipation).<br/><br/>The 2 player decks have different themes and art: one deck has a &quot;Don Quixote&quot; theme (with Gustave Dor&eacute; art) and the other deck has various Esperanto authors (&quot;Verdaj Donkiĥotoj&quot;).<br/><br/>With multiple sets, it is possible to play with more than 2 players.<br/><br/>",

Austrian Emperor Joseph II sought Bavaria for himself; Prussian King Frederick II wished to block this acquisition. Their conflict became known as the War of the Bavarian Succession or, more colorfully, as the Potato War. Armies of both sides marched about Bohemia, scouring the landscape for food (potatoes in particular) while the diplomats hashed out a solution.<br/><br/>Soldier Kings: The Potato War brings this worldwide interlocking conflict to Soldier Kings, as Britain struggles with a growing insurgency in her American colonies, France fans those flames and supports Austria, Prussia seeks to block the annexation of Bavaria and Russia supports Prussia. Happy Austria has once again married her way to more territory, but still has to take possession.<br/><br/>The Potato War is a 64-page book supplement for Soldier Kings, a multiplayer game of the Seven Years' War. In addition to the new Potato War scenario and its pieces, there are new pieces (with optional rules for their use) for the Seven Years' War scenarios of Soldier Kings, plus some additional options.<br/><br/>",

With so many of these battles taking place around islands or in narrow channels and shallow waters, sneaky tactics and cunning maneuvers are a hallmark of warfare of this era, and the rules use an integrated turn system to allow a commander to position ships to go in and ram without being rammed in return, or to employ feints and traps to tempt the enemy out of position and leave his ships vulnerable to a follow-up strike.<br/><br/>With data for ships throughout the period, rules for famous admirals, historical scenarios, a campaign system and a brief historical summary for those who wish to refresh their memory of the era, Poseidon's Warriors offers everything players need to bring to the tabletop the battles and campaigns of the first great age of naval warfare.<br/><br/>",

The players then deal out there focus pile and stamina cards, leaving the remainder of their cards as their luck deck.<br/><br/>To clear your focus deck, players simultaneously play with four zones gaining experience points and treasure. These zones are the level (where the monsters are milling about, ready to fight along with the level cards), their focus, stamina, and luck decks.<br/><br/>When a players focus deck has been cleared, unless otherwise noted by the level, the round ends. Players count up the cards played into the field, subtract any remaining focus, and take their hidden treasure which is revealed at the end of the game.<br/><br/>The player with the most experience points at the end of the game, including their hidden treasure, gains bragging rights until the next time the adventures play.<br/><br/>",

        "description": "Bukkake! takes a classic fetish and turns it into a fun card game that mixes strategy and luck. It's weird, addictive, and makes for a very interesting game night. The goal of the game is to &quot;come&quot; on the player in the middle of the circle and get them out. If you're the last player standing, you win! Despite how it sounds, Bukkake! is not erotic and does not require anyone to literally ejaculate. While the theme of the game is clearly sexual, that's about as far as we take it. None of the cards are pornographic-all imagery is euphemistic. For example, the genital named &quot;the spicy pepper&quot; is just an image of a chili pepper. The only exception is the vagina card, which depicts an anatomy textbook-style vagina. It's not pornographic. We felt society is underinformed about female anatomy and wanted to educate in a weird way.<br/><br/>",

The primary focus of the game is on soldiers and NCOs in light &quot;flank&quot; companies, as they scout ahead of larger forces and take part in man-to-man actions against enemy skirmishers.<br/><br/>Although the game allows for the formation of accurately sized companies of light infantry and cavalry if you wish, these formations are broken down into small groups of up to a dozen men. For the most part, officers are not swashbuckling super-heroes, but staunch commanders who rally and direct their men to achieve the battlefield objectives. Although the games uses an alternating action turn sequence, officers can use their influence to multiple units at the same time in an effort to steal the initiative. With all rolls resolved using standard 6-sided dice, this game combines a classic wargaming feel with modern wargame mechanics.<br/><br/>",

On the back of the game-map sheets were shown the assembly diagrams for the parts contained in the package and the game rules, in four languages, with numerous illustrations for clarification.<br/><br/>The main fight rules were checkers/chess like: the player pieces must enter the enemy squares to eliminate his soldiers, with some hierarchical precedencies: e.g. no foot soldiers can eliminate horse-mounted ones. Non dice were used anywhere in the games.<br/><br/>From the publisher (translated):<br/>Adobe Walls - June 27, 1874 &ndash; n&deg;1458<br/>The village of the Canadian name Adobe Wells in Texas served as centre for goods exchanges with the Comanches and Kiowas. The spreading of the buffalo hunting that menaced their life-style enraged the Comanches, Kiawos and Cheiennes so much, that they attacked the village under Quanah Parker's orders, on June 27, 1874. After a ten hours battle the Americans had 3 fallen and the Indians 80. The assault had failed, since the buffalo hunters were all sharp shooters.<br/><br/>RULES<br/>HOW TO START THE GAME<br/>One of the two players keeps the Americans and the other keeps the Indians. The American player moves first, but initially the soldiers are placed outside the west side of the playing map. The Indians player goes second, but start with his pieces already on the squares on the east border of the map.<br/>HOW TO MOVE<br/>A) On each square the players may place from 1 to a max. of 4 soldier pieces.<br/>B) Each piece may be moved l square at a time.<br/>C) Each piece may move in a straight line only, never diagonally.<br/>D) Each turn each player can move only the pieces that start the turn on the same square: i.e., at each turn can be moved only the pieces of 1 square (one or more of them).<br/>E) Foot soldiers only (i.e.: no vehicles or horses) may enter the squares where there are houses.<br/>HOW TO ELIMINATE THE ENEMY<br/>A) In order to eliminate the enemy pieces it is necessary to enter the square where they stand.<br/>B) Foot soldiers con eliminate only other foot soldiers (e.g.: no horse mounted ones). <br/>C) All the enemy pieces in a square are eliminated even if only a single adversary piece enter the square.<br/>WHO WINS THE BATTLE<br/>The player who succeeds in eliminating all opposing forces is the winner of the battle.<br/><br/>",

        "description": "Palette Swap is a 2-4 player logic puzzle game in which you are given a 'palette' of primary colors that you mix, match, and swap with your fellow artists in order to complete your schemes to win the game. If you're clever you can complete multiple schemes in a single turn, and close attention is rewarded if another artist creates the scheme you were after when it's not your turn.<br/><br/>On your turn, you may spend two of the five colors in your palette for their effects. Red allows you to match the colors your opponents have, yellow lets you mix your colors and theirs together, and blue lets you swap a color from your palette with one of another player's colors. Playing two primary colors gets you a secondary color, which simply combines the effects of the two primaries. Playing two secondary colors get you a black, which you must use on your next turn and costs you your secondary colors.<br/><br/>As you change the colors you possess and your opponent's, you will be able to complete your goals, all of which are based on actual color schemes such as split complimentary and analogous schemes. Accomplishing all five of your schemes first makes you the victor.<br/><br/>The game also includes cooperative rules for playing with younger children and rules for solo play.<br/><br/>",

You will customize your 25' tall Mech with a selection of weaponry and upgrades, and then hunt and engage the enemy.<br/><br/>This solitaire game is played over a series of turns where you may engage randomly generated encounters.  Attacks are made through die-rolling that can activate a variety of weaponry and standard attacks.

        "description": "Inspired by fast paced tabletop games and chock-full of jokes, references, and stereotypes that anyone who has ever played a massively multiplayer online game can appreciate, Ready Check is a card based game where players take over the role of leading their guild to become the biggest, baddest, and most popular guild in their realm.<br/><br/>Ready Check boasts very simple and streamlined game mechanics.  Your job is to recruit gamers to your guild and use them to raid dungeons. Dungeons are worth victory points and the first player to 20 VPs is the winner.<br/><br/>Each turn consists of two phases.<br/><br/><br/>     The Guild Management Phase is where gamers (those found lurking the Forums eagerly awaiting to join your guild) are recruited to your guild and loot is added to your Guild Stash (your collection of the most epic bounty and claimed dungeons).<br/>     The Dungeon Phase is where the raiding happens. Loot cards and victory points are earned by successfully raiding Dungeons. Harder dungeons offer more VPs and, of course, a better shot at getting that epic loot!<br/><br/><br/>You can download a complete copy of the rules and free-to-play Print-n-Play from our web page.<br/><br/>",

Storytellers use this information to tell a story using their hand of Plot Cards.<br/><br/>Plot Cards contain tired clich&eacute;s, action beats, random events, and hilarious happenings. Storytellers stitch together as many Plot Cards as they need to tell their version of the selected Trope Card prompt, making up the events between cards as they go. Stories can be simple tales, outrageous romps, or outright-insane cartoons &ndash; as long as you can justify the Plot Cards you use in your story, you can use them however you'd like!<br/><br/>After all Storytellers have told their stories for the round, they cast votes for their favorite stories of the round. Votes in Plot Twist are weighted &ndash; you get three Story Point Cards to use each round and you can give them out however you want. Feel free to spread your votes around to multiple Storytellers, or give all three to your favorite story!<br/><br/>The story with the most votes at the end of each round wins that round's Trope Card as a point.

The concept is incredibly simple -- one player (acting as a judge) draws a random card containing a fill in the blank sentence in the target language and the other players play a card containing a noun from their hand. The player who has played the sentence card then chooses the best card played and that player scores a point. Play continues with that player as the new judge.<br/><br/>All VERBA players benefit from seeing high frequency words, with many repetitions, in a context that fosters authentic learning and comprehensible input. As with all of The Pericles Group's educational games, the play objectives and the learning objectives are one in the same. Players win by making comprehensible sentences, scaffolded by the cards, the images, and the helpful hints included on the sentence cards. We always want to ensure that the learners are seeing correct forms and those forms are continually reinforced by the mechanics.<br/><br/>Core Set: Includes 50 sentence cards and 146 noun cards. Designed for the novice learner. of English as a second language. VERBA: English is also great for younger native speakers of English as they begin to expand their use of language.<br/><br/>",

        "description": "Big Bad Overlord is a card and dice game for 3-6 people in which players assume the roles of evil Dukes vying to take over the world. Players gather minions great and small, ranging from Riff-Raff to Horrible Monsters, battle each other, and fend off attacks by occasional do-gooders (such as adventuring bands and small children). The game takes about an hour to play.<br/><br/>The goal is to eliminate all other players and become the Big Bad Overlord. Players start with six cards, half of which they can keep face-down. The face-up cards serve as the players' armies and can be used to attack other players. Each turn, players draw a new card and add it to their army. (Unless they draw a do-gooder, in which case the player has to fight it off!) There are three combat abilities - Mind control, Magic, and Melee. Most cards have at least one ability, and some have more. A successful Mind-control attack allows you to capture an enemy card; magic blows things up (especially cards weak against magic, such as the otherwise powerful Machines-O-Death); and melee allows you to chop things up.<br/><br/>Players fight each other using all available attacks, rolling 2 six-sided dice to determine the winner of each battle. Die rolls are modified according to the relative attack and defense strengths of each side's army in each combat category. But even the most lopsided of battles isn't in vain - a natural 12 always wins, no matter what the modifiers, and a natural 2 always fails.<br/><br/>In addition to the evil minions and do-gooders, the deck contains two magical artifacts. They're important because players need them to survive the endgame. When all the cards are drawn from the deck, only players who have an artifact survive. At that point, if two players are still in the game, there's a final battle in which the evil Dukes use the artifacts to smash each other's troops.<br/><br/>Players can gang up on each other, help each other defend against attack, backstab each other, and more. Defeat your foes, play them against each other, hoard a precious artifact or obtain one at all costs - Big Bad Overlord is a game where it's good to be bad.<br/><br/>",

        "description": "Wizard's Tower Solitaire is a Tarot card game based on the playing card solitaire game Spider. The game begins by laying out all 78 cards face up in 13 rows of 6. Cards of the bottom column are exposed and may be placed below any card of the next higher numerical value or overlapping the next higher numerical value of the same suit. Overlapping cards may be moved as a unit and removed from play when it is complete. Trump cards may be placed under any other Trumps of a higher numerical value or overlapping a Trump of the next higher numerical value. When the Fool is exposed it is transferred to the top of the tableau to form the foundation of the Wizard's Tower and other Trumps are placed on it in ascending numerical value. Any exposed card may be transferred to an empty column and weaving may be used to overcome a blocked game. The goal of the game is to remove all but the Wizard's Tower of Trump cards which remains mysteriously suspended in the air after the cliffs below it have been blasted away by magic.<br/><br/>",

        "description": "Incredible Courage 100 Days &ndash; Ligny is the second installment in a 4 game set that explores Napoleon&rsquo;s 100 Days campaign that ended his reign and finished his aspirations as emperor of France.  This was Napoleon&rsquo;s Last Victory and he managed it against an enemy force that was larger than his own.  The best part of this game is that the French Imperial Guard is located at this battle. Incredible Courage 100 Days &ndash; Quatre Bras is required to play this game.<br/><br/>There are 7 scenarios included in this game and 3 of them are on the small side in terms of unit density.  These scenarios include &quot;The Battle of Ligny&quot;, &quot;The Battle for the Amand&rsquo;s&quot;, &quot;The Fight for St Amand&quot;, &quot;The Battle for Ligny&quot;, &quot;The Guard Assault on Ligny&quot;, &quot;Pinning the III Korps&quot;, and &quot;Boignee&quot;.  &quot;The Battle of Ligny&quot; scenario takes you into the fight for the entire battle.  With all its intricate details and nuances that show how the Prussians kept feeding the II Korps Reserves into the I Korps battle for the Amand&rsquo;s, and the battle for the town of Ligny proper.  In &quot;The Battle for the Amand&rsquo;s&quot; both players will be faced with how to take or hold a series of villages that are crawling with Prussians.  The tight terrain makes the fight extremely hard and yet the French force more and more of the Prussian II Korps reserves to be moved to this area.  A smaller scenario that focuses on this area is &quot;The Fight for St Amand&quot; which has one French division making its attack and seeing the Prussians respond.  <br/>In &quot;The Battle for Ligny&quot; the French are assigned the unenviable task of pushing a brigade of Prussians out of the town.  In &quot;The Guard Assault on Ligny&quot; the French player is making the final attack of the day with the Imperial Guard.  This is their last success.  &quot;Pinning the III Korps&quot; is the situation on the French right flank and holding the Prussian III Korps in place as the other forces fight the main battle.  The last scenario is a hypothetical.  In &quot;Boignee&quot; the Prussian player is forced to make an attack on the French right and see if he can change the course of the battle by making Napoleon react to that.<br/><br/>There are a couple of interesting options for inclusion into scenarios in this game.<br/>    The French VI Corps arrives earlier<br/>    The Prussian III Korps is Pinned and can't cross the Ligny Stream<br/><br/>This game features the final map artwork of Rick Barber.

While the peace holds you will recruit captains to your side and deploy a fleet of starships. But after a declaration of war there is no course left except to engage your opponent's fleet and triumph!<br/><br/>Starships Assembly is a two-player strategy game played with 20 cards, each with a captain on one side and a ship on the other.<br/><br/>The Assembly phase is a peaceful political arena. A card from your hand could be played as a recruited captain, where captains cast votes and have special abilities. Spend your votes to recruit more captains and also to play cards from your hand using the other side: a deployed ship.<br/><br/>Eventually one player or the other will cause a declaration of war. Then every card that is not a ship gets shuffled together and your fleet of ships is all you take with you to the final Open Warfare phase.<br/><br/>War has been declared! There are no reinforcements! From here on out you must defeat the enemy fleet, ship by ship. Be the last player with a ship to win the game!<br/><br/>",

        "description": "From the publisher:<br/><br/>Crisis is a modern game with many innovations like a virtual, generic map, no general certificate or money limits, rounds instead of operating rounds and stock rounds, structure purchases, and signals but without some traditional elements like off-board connections, terrain difficulties, small cities, empty big cities, or privates. This gives the game a new feeling already on the surface. Square tiles are used to simulate subways in a downtown megalopolis.<br/><br/>While once 1830 could be called the premier game of stock manipulation and 1841 is the game with the greatest speed of technological development, now Crisis is the toughest, most complex, and most unpredictable game of business strategy. Measuring complexity is hard but years of testing have produced counter-strategies for every strategy and not enabled me to foresee just one round, what is possible in 1830 or 1841.<br/><br/>So what makes Crisis so tough? First of all, companies can purchase unlimited numbers of foreign shares. This creates complex combines. Second, companies are forced to own more and more foreign shares, what makes good shares scarce. This is an extra duty besides buying a train. Third, foreign assets may only be bought from the or as a director. Fourth, all shareholders can be responsible for under-endowed companies while some might avoid supports and let the director lose his shares even though having supported. Fifth, other shares in such companies may not be given away and can cause more supports. Sixth, half the companies have only certificates that already allow a director change. Seventh, trading many old or new certificates quickly restructures combines, depletes companies, or inflates money. Eighth, the stock market and the round order, which involves players and companies, are particularly flexible. To conclude, dividends are paid only to owned foreign shares.<br/><br/>While the game has a balanced start and good route construction remains important, it becomes more and more essential to excel at wheeling and dealing. Clearly, Crisis is the game of devious business manipulations.<br/><br/>",

The board uses Necker Cube optical illusion giving the players the sense of each climbing a pyramid though they are all moving in different directions.<br/>Each player starts with 5 pieces on the base of the pyramid, having to climb to the top in order to win. First player reaching the top of the pyramid wins the game. Each turn players must roll 2 dice which can show &ldquo;advance&rdquo; or &ldquo;change&rdquo; 1 or more pieces. Then the player must choose one of them and perform the actions. Advance mean going &ldquo;up&rdquo; in the current pyramid the pieces are on, change means the piece will move in other color pyramid, being then able to take other player pieces but not climbing to win the game. A taken piece goes to the base of it&rsquo;s color.<br/><br/>",

He requires your services but there&rsquo;s still time for a mug of ale if you hurry. As you enter the Drunken Stallion, a foot is extended and causes you to trip into another man. With a curse he turns on you and tries to slap your face. You grab his hand, and he pulls away.

Players grow their victory pile and point total matching rabbits with adopters according to adopter preferences, gaining bonuses if the rabbit is difficult to place (Is it sick or unfriendly? Does it disdain the litter box or other bunnies?) or part of a bonded pair--bunny-to-bunny bonding forming the other matching activity.<br/><br/>Too many bunnies for the available space (on an individual's tableau) and too few (or finicky) adopters at turn's end demand players negotiate with competitors who may have space, or get creative with bonding lest they have to send bunny foo-foos to paid foster care (with its victory point penalties).<br/><br/>Cards for personal assistants (with issues and assets), Easter, dump crises, media fads, rich and fickle benefactors are among the items that provide variety within games and between sessions.<br/><br/>This game is designed, tested by gamers under the oversight of the Los Angeles Rabbit Foundation, a chapter of the House Rabbit Society.<br/><br/>",

        "description": "Hockey Cup is a game about building a hockey team. It is inspired by Baseball Highlights: 2045 by Mike Fitzgerald. It uses Games Cards system.<br/><br/>Hockey Cup is like watching TV highlights of hockey games. In this quick and interactive game, two coaches build their teams as they play, combining both strategy (building the team) and tactics (playing the game) without any of the downtime. During each &quot;mini-game&quot;, each coach alternates playing six cards to simulate a full game's highlights &ndash; 3 defensive and 3 offensive actions. Whichever team wins the most mini-games in the series takes the cup!<br/><br/>Coaches start the game with a team, which consists of 15 1st level players. On his turn a coach sends one offensive player to make 1 trick, and the other coach sends one defensive player to prevent the trick. Next, both players may use one of their special actions. An unprevented trick leads to goal. At the end of third period, if the score is tied, they play overtime, which is followed by a penalty shootout. After every game, a coach uses 3 experience points to raise the level of his players. A 2nd level player can make 2 tricks, 3rd level - 3 tricks.<br/><br/>",

        "description": "Game description from the publisher:<br/><br/>Ostfront is the result of 5 years of research and play-testing. Its a comprehensive World War 2 system aimed at historical accuracy, balance and fun. The rules have been streamlined over the years, and we would consider it &quot;fast play&quot; - Its quick, brutal and rewards bold commanders with sound tactics.<br/><br/>Ostfront covers Infantry, Light Vehicles, all varieties of Tanks and Self-Propelled guns, Artillery in the form of Field Guns and Howitzers, Air Support and Air defense, as well various other forms of support and fortifications. It can be played in any theater of WW2, from North Africa to the Pacific. Aimed at 1/72, 1/100 or smaller scale miniatures. It would also work fine for 28mm.<br/><br/>The Ostfront system is all about combined arms - it plays at a Company to Battalion level, with the smallest unit being the Infantry Platoon. Infantry are deployed in bases, each one representing about 25 men for regulars, and about 10 men for the veteran Assault Infantry units. At 1/72 scale we usually use 3-4 miniatures per base, meaning you can make a large amount of bases from any cheap infantry box - one airfix box of 48 miniatures would give you 10 bases.<br/><br/>Tanks are of course a large part of Ostfront battles, with the average game fielding anywhere from 1 to 20 of them per side, sometimes more in larger games. Light vehicles play an important role, and reconnaissance has a tangible effect in-game - he who scouts out the area first can gain a tactical advantage.<br/><br/>We Split WW2 into 3 periods, allowing balanced battles to be fought and still capture the feelings of operations like Barbarossa and Operation Torch. Its not always about who has the most heavy tanks - in fact heavy tanks are somewhat expensive in the points system, due to the difficulty with which they were produced, maintained and transported. During early war players will need to rely on light tanks, Infantry, Artillery and air strikes to secure their objectives. Mid war covers Kursk style battles - with the Tiger, Panther and Sherman all making an appearance, but before heavier Soviet tanks like the IS-2 or T-34/85 had come into action. Late war covers all the late war toys, from the JagdTiger and Tiger II to the Pershing, to the aforementioned IS-2, among many others.<br/><br/>Ostfront also has a campaign system for combination map-and-tabletop play, allowing you to get that glorious combination of grand strategy and tabletop tactics. The campaign allows up to 5 players to go head-to-head on a map of Europe and North Africa, from Spain to Russia, Scandinavia to Egypt. Each faction fights to control production centres - where they produce more forces each turn, and to spread their supply lines out to the places they need to conquer. A technology race is also implemented, with players who control Tech Centres able to produce slightly more advanced units - even extending to post war tanks if the game is currently in late war - ever wanted a good reason to use a Maus or IS-3? Well here's your chance.<br/><br/>Every time forces make contact on the Campaign map, an Ostfront tabletop battle is fought, with the amount of points on the campaign map dictating how many points you can use in your table top battle. After the battle the results are applied to the Campaign: if you lost 50% of your forces during the game, your force on the Campaign map will also lose 50%. If you were able to win the objectives and cut off your enemies supply train on the table, you will be able to force him back on the campaign map.<br/><br/>This connectedness makes each tabletop battle have a purpose, and adds a lot of flavor to the game as a whole. You might know you're horribly outnumbered, but you need to give the enemy force a bloody nose while you wait for your main force and your allies to come to your aid, and so you will build a specific list for that game, and that purpose. The campaign also allows for combined attacks, out-flanking maneuvers, encirclement and cutting off of supply lines, and a free-form diplomacy system is also implemented.<br/><br/>Two Campaign maps are available for free download, one is a balanced map for a slightly ahistorical but balanced campaign. The other is a realistic map for a  more accurate WW2 campaign.<br/><br/>",

        "description": "INTRODUCTION TO THE GAME<br/>A stormy period of the election to the City Council has just finished. The current model of managing cities has been hugely criticized. Many of the changes that took place in Poland and in the world resulted in the search for new ways of dealing with the problem.<br/><br/>The project CreaCity takes place in a number of big and small places scattered all over the world. Your city has become one of the participants of this great plan aimed at fixing the world.<br/><br/>The project assumes forming a Small Council for one term of office, which will deal with critical issues and those demanding immediate action. Your task will be to take decisions which satisfy the residents and indicate the direction of the development of the city, and at the same time avoid bringing it to bankruptcy.<br/><br/>This experiment may reveal new future leaders, so, even if you do not succeed, this game might be the beginning of something fantastic, both for you and the entire world.<br/><br/>CreaCity is a live action board game, during which players take on the role of councillors during the meetings of the Small City Council.<br/><br/>Each player will receive their character card stating their objectives and the committee they belong to. Each round of the game means very intense 45 minutes, during which committee members will be entrusted with Small and Big Challenges. It is these Challenges that CreaCity will be based on and, depending on the decisions taken by the players, the situation in the city will be changing.<br/><br/>The city is symbolized by a map divided into 8 regions. There are two dice placed in each region: a satisfaction dice (blue) and a dissatisfaction one (red).<br/><br/>Every time players take a binding decision, its effects will be transferred onto the board &ndash; satisfaction in the region will change (by changing the values on the dice), general satisfaction in the city and the available budget will change as well, and special buildings will appear.<br/><br/>Players start with a high degree of social trust and their decisions are aimed at gaining the largest general satisfaction possible. Af ter 5 rounds the game ends and the players check who accomplished the greatest number of objectives. Depending on the condition of the city, the entire Small Council receives appropriate number of victory points<br/><br/>GAME OBJECTIVES<br/>For a period of 5 rounds you must not let the city go bankrupt. It happens when:<br/><br/>     on the board, there will be 5 region bankruptcy tags.<br/>     The Dissatisfaction Tag will cross field number 30.<br/><br/><br/>What is more, fight for your personal result and accomplish your objectives.<br/><br/>",

India-Pakistan War is a Platoon Commander module simulating the conflict during August and September of 1965 between India and Pakistan in the Chawinda region of Kashmir.  The module designer, David K. van Hoose; has brought to life some of the largest armor battles since the Battle of Kursk. The module includes five scenarios that will take the gamer from small skirmishes to the slugfests that produced what has become known as the Grave Yard of Tanks. Fight with Chieftains, Easy Eight Shermans, Pattons, and AMX-13 tanks, insert Guerillas behind the enemy&rsquo;s lines, and call devastating artillery support. The historically accurate forces are at your command. Can you lead them to victory?<br/><br/>Platoon Commander is a Mark H. Walker designed, platoon-level game system depicting armored combat from 1936 into the near future. The counters represent everything from tanks and infantry to armored personnel carriers and, as the technology progresses, even missile teams. The game uses an innovative sequence of play; a card-assisted system that is partially impulse driven, partially turn-based, and all fun. Morale plays a decisive role, and the period&rsquo;s equipment is understandably depicted with colors and numbers on each counter. From the designer of Lock &lsquo;n Load, World at War, and Night of Man, Platoon Commander is an exciting, accessible game of strategy and tactics.<br/><br/>",

This is a game, not a simulation, and while intended to provide an insight into the struggles of the era it is meant to be fast, fun, and challenging rather than an in-depth recreation of events. This pack covers selected battles of what is known as the First Civil War, from the first major engagement at Edgehill in 1642 until the kings decisive defeat at Naseby in 1645. The designer hopes that playing these scenarios will generate interest in the history of the period and will encourage gamers to read more about the era both for education and entertainment.<br/><br/>A half sheet of die-cut mounted playing pieces is also included, as is version 1.5 of the main Holy Roman Empire rule book.<br/><br/>",

This game plays on an old world tavern theme where you try to capture an opponents glass of ale using a set of stone game pieces. The players can utilize augments such as the sword, shield, horse, and war ram in order to gain an advantage.<br/><br/>On your turn you may move any two stones up to a number of spaces equal to that particular stones designation. The Fate stone's maximum movement is determined by rolling 1d6 at the start of each of the players turn. Once two stones have been moved, play moves clockwise among the players.<br/><br/>On their turn a player can attack an opponents stone, sending it back across the board to it's starting position within it's stockade. However, this causes the attacking stone to become knocked prone and vulnerable to being pinned by an opponent moving on top. The pinned stoned cannot move until the start of a turn where it is not longer pinned.<br/><br/>Using augments such as the horse or the shield gives you a bonus to movement or defending against attacks, receptively. Use of the war ram and sword give offensive bonuses.<br/><br/>The game ends once a players moves three of his five stones into the stockade of an opponent, effectively capturing his glass of ale and winning the game.<br/><br/>The game incorporates optional rules for playing with your favorite beverage.<br/><br/>",

        "description": "When some of the most dangerous monsters are captured, they are sent to dungeons all over the world, but some of those dungeons's keepers might be even more dangerous than the monsters themselves as they are part of an evil organization of Dungeon Overlords, and like every dark entity, all they want is to be in possession of the meanest and angriest monsters they can get. That's why when they receive weak monsters, they always try to send them to other dungeons. Who will be the last true Overlord?<br/><br/>Monsters in Motion is a fast paced party game for 3 to 8 players. Each player will have a limited set of choices during the game; the amount of strategy, deception and push your luck will start building up as the game goes on.<br/><br/>Each player will receive 4 monster cards and 3 power souls which represent the live points.<br/>On each turn, each player has to choose a monster card and put it face-down in front of him.<br/><br/>Starting from the Overlord with the Soulstone (first player token) and following in the direction previously selected, each player will have to choose one of two actions:<br/><br/>1.KEEP: The player will keep the face-down monster.<br/>2.SWAP: The player will swap the monster with the next player in turn order, the said player having to accept the swap unless his monster ability indicates differently.<br/><br/>After that, everyone is required to reveal their cards and other monster abilities will trigger.  Finally, the weakest monster will make his overlord lose one power soul.<br/><br/>When a player loses all his power souls he will become a ghost. Living players (that still have power souls in front of them) cannot talk with ghosts, if they do, the ghost will be able to steal a power soul from them. The only living player that can talk with ghosts is the person in charge of the Soulstone.<br/><br/>When a ghost is in charge of the Soulstone he will be able to play that round, and during that round he will get one card from the monster deck. Ghosts are still ghosts, even if they are playing a round, so living players cannot talk with them. <br/>If a ghost succeeds in stealing a power soul from other player or revives thanks to a monster ability, he will be completely back in the game and so he will draw the same number of cards as the other players.<br/><br/>Each monster will have powers that will trigger at different moments during the game. As the game goes on, each power will be crucial to win the game. The winner will be the last Overlord alive.<br/><br/>",

At the beginning, the board is empty. Black moves first. <br/>The Black player's first move is obligatorily on one of the 8 squares along the North side of the board.<br/><br/>After that, each player will choose an entry square for their counter, placed along one of the two next side rows (clockwise) with reference to the last piece played.<br/><br/>A counter slides (also jumping over any other counters already present on the game board) along the line perpendicular to the selected side, and stopping on the first empty square encountered.<br/>Ambiguous moves are forbidden: that means you are not allowed to place your counter on a square that may be reached from both sides where you can play in your turn.<br/><br/>In this game the counters are captured by flanking them; the result of a capture is instead the same as in Othello. <br/>The aim of the game is to be the first to complete an orthogonal or diagonal line of at least four counters of the player&rsquo;s colour, avoiding a simultaneous alignment of four or more of the opponent&rsquo;s counters.<br/><br/>",

Scores for each hand are accumulated and the player with the highest grand total wins the game. Players can draw equal and it is possible for them to end a hand, or even a game, with a negative score.<br/><br/>Having been dealt a hand of twelve cards, players, in turn, move their marker round the board, discarding cards, picking up cards, scoring points, deducting points from other players, and from themselves. The maximum number of points a player can score in any hand is &lsquo;50&rsquo; but they can score extra points if having &ldquo;declared&rdquo; (played all their numerical cards), they are left only with Kings, Queens, Jacks (Court Cards), provided these are ALL of the same suit.<br/><br/>Players move their marker and score points according to the value of the cards which they play. For example; a &lsquo;1&rsquo; of any suit is worth one point and allows the player to move their marker forward one space; a &lsquo;2&rsquo;, two points and two spaces; a &lsquo;3&rsquo; three points and three spaces, and so on, up to &lsquo;10&rsquo;. Players must always play a card of the suit matching the suit on the space which their marker is in.<br/><br/>Court Cards follow a different rule. Players move their marker forward for the number of spaces indicated by the value on the particular Court Card played but, they DO NOT score any points. Instead they DEDUCT from their score, points to the value of the Court Card played. Only when a player &ldquo;declares&rdquo; do Court Cards take on a positive value&hellip;.<br/><br/>(The cards for this game are specialized: The &ldquo;Ace&rdquo; has been replaced with a &lsquo;1&rsquo;; the &ldquo;King&rdquo; has a caricature of Robert the Bruce; the &ldquo;Queen&rdquo; is Mary, Queen of Scots; the &quot;Jack&quot; is Bonnie Prince Charlie (Charles Edward Stewart), and the &ldquo;Jokers&rdquo; are Crowns. An extra Joker/Crown card has been added for a total of 55 cards per deck.)<br/><br/>",

Not quite so simple now is it?<br/><br/>",

Only one person can escape while the rest will perish. Beware as you do not know the other players&rsquo; identities and Enigma might just be one of them.<br/><br/>There are 2 ways to win in highly-addictive game of strategy, deduction and deception from the creators of Mystery Manila:<br/><br/>(1) Be the first person to escape<br/>(2) Be the last person left alive<br/><br/>If you are playing the character of Enigma, the only way to win is to kill everybody else.<br/><br/>Each game box contains the following components:<br/><br/>- 7 Character Cards<br/>- 7 Exit Cards<br/>- 7 Tool Tokens<br/><br/>To start the game, each player is handed at random a Character Card with a specific ability. An Exit Card is randomly drawn and placed faced down in the middle of the table. This card is now the Escape Card.<br/><br/>All remaining Character Cards and Exit Cards are placed in two separate piles near the center of the table. All Tool Tokens are also placed individually at the center of the table.<br/><br/>Everyone closes their eyes. While one person counts loudly back from ten, the player holding the Enigma Character Card opens his eyes, looks at the Escape Card, and places it back to it's original position.<br/><br/>In every game of Escape from Enigma, players take turns doing one of the following actions:<br/><br/>- Take an Exit Card<br/>- Take a Tool Token<br/>- Do Character Card's ability<br/>- Bluff and do another Character Card's ability<br/>- Change your Character Card (except if you are Enigma)<br/>- Attempt to escape (except if you are Enigma)<br/>- Pass<br/><br/>To Escape, a player must call out a Tool Token he owns and peek at the Escape Card. If they match, the player wins the game. Otherwise, that player is eliminated.<br/><br/>When a player is eliminated, all his Exit Cards and Tool Tokens are returned to the center of the table, and the game resumes.<br/><br/>A second way to get eliminated for the game is through bluffing. When a player bluffs and is challenged, the defender and the challenger must show each other their Character Cards. Whoever loses the challenge is eliminated and gives the winner all his Exit Cards and Tool Tokens. The winner may also assume the loser's Character Card.<br/><br/>Will you be the survivor of Escape from Enigma?<br/><br/>",

Each player manages three dreadnoughts that are fighting over the dominion of the solar system. The rules of engagement from the Treaty of Venus after the First Worlds War limit acts of aggression to one-to-one ship combat. Ships that are badly damaged or out of energy often have the option of warping away and allowing another dreadnought take its place. But if your opponent anticipates it, she can block your escape. However, if she tries to do that and you did not try to Swap Out, her turn is wasted. Thus the main mechanics of this game are rock-paper-scissors, bluffing, and energy/damage management.<br/><br/>",

In addition everyone receives 12 coins of starting money.<br/><br/>Each game round starts by the players receiving their income. Players then draw a new card from the pile and play cards from their hand. Many cards have certain prerequisites and most cost coins. Lastly players may discard a card at the end of their turn and may have to redraw new cards.<br/><br/>In order to win the game players collect votes for the mayoral election from districts, people and other cards. The person with the highest number of votes wins the mayoral election and thereby the game. The second way to win is for a player to attain the title Count by collecting 120 experience points through playing out cards.<br/><br/>",

The rule book contains a number finished Popdoku layouts together with the starting tile layout for each.<br/> One player becomes the &quot;host&quot; and they select one of the layouts and set up the board with the shown starting tile layout for it, typically 20 to 30 tiles.<br/> Each of the other players now draw 9 tiles to their rack. The timer is started and the first player then adds as many tiles to the layout as they like but as soon as they lay an incorrect tile their turn stops, that tile is returned to them and their turn is scored, being the total sum of the tile values that they have added. The player makes up their tile rack to 9 tiles again and the turn moves on. The earlier they get rid of all their tiles the larger the bonus they get (15, 10 5 and 0)<br/>A player may give up his turn to change the tiles on his rack with a random lot from the bag.<br/><br/><br/>",

(To play all permutations of player numbers and board sizes would require approximately 75 pieces in one color, 75 pieces in a second color, 50 pieces in a third color, and 40 pieces in a fourth color.)<br/><br/>Basic idea:      In Archipelago, players try to create more islands (i.e. groups of two or more adjacent pieces) than opponents create.<br/><br/>\t\t\t\t<br/>\t\t\t\t<br/>\t\t\t\t\tRULESA group (&quot;island&quot;) is a connected set of two or more same-colored stones. (Thus, single stones do not count as a group.)  Each player is the owner of one color of stone.  A group in a given color will count toward its color-owner's score, regardless of whether the color-owner or an opponent created that group.<br/><br/>Players are allowed two stone placements per turn, with one exception: the first player plays just one stone on his/her very first turn. A player&rsquo;s two stones can be ANY color (i.e. on your turn, you needn't play any of your own color of stones if you don't wish to; you can play any set of colors or any mix of colors in a single turn).<br/><br/>Additionally, a player is permitted to play an extra stone (of any color of his/her choice) for every opponent who is strictly ahead of him/her in the current group score; each player's &quot;group score&quot; = the number of distinct groups currently on the board in his/her color.<br/><br/>When the board is full, or when all players have consecutively passed their turns, the game ends. The player with the most groups wins.  In case of a tie, the winner is the tied player with the highest bonus score total.  (Bonus scores are awarded on the game's scoring track; arriving earlier than one's opponents to a new group score grants one a higher bonus.)<br/><br/>For games with 3-4 players, the following &quot;Frozen Irrelevance&quot; rule is recommended:<br/><br/>o    Frozen Irrelevance: When the board arrangement is such that a player's current rank (e.g. 1st, 2nd, or 3rd) is unalterable by any further play from any player, then that player's rank has assumed its final form, and he/she is &quot;frozen&quot; from further play. That is, he/she takes no further part in the game, and the game play continues on with just the non-frozen players.<br/><br/>For a complete set of rules and examples turns, see the Files section of this webpage.<br/><br/>",

After each round, players may trade between themselves for the goods they need or with the farmers market to make the best use of their goods for points.<br/><br/>",

The series is set in 1985, in an alternate history of World War III. With the Warsaw Pact armies driving deep into Western Europe, and as China simultaneously decides to take advantage of the global distraction to settle some old territorial scores, the Middle East erupts as well. Israel launches a pre-emptive strike to deflate yet another attempt by the Syrians to re-conquer the Golan Heights. But the Syrians have rebuilt their army in the three years since they were defeated in Lebanon by these same Israelis. And the Syrian High Command has anticipated such a move by the Israelis. They have developed a counter-strategy with a simple goal: drive the Israeli Army into the Mediterranean Sea.<br/> The World At War 85 system features a unique combat system that involves die rolls by both attacking units and defending units, which keeps both players engaged throughout the game. Die rolls are compared and hits applied quickly, as all the information you need to fight your units is on the counters. No combat results table is necessary. Initiative, formation activation, random turn length, close air support and air cover are all smoothly integrated.<br/><br/>It&rsquo;s all here:<br/><br/><br/>     Basic, Advanced and, for each Volume, Optional Rules.<br/>     Units include:<br/>         ISRAELI Merkava-2 Main Battle Tank<br/>         ISRAELI F-4E Close Air Support Aircraft<br/>         SYRIAN T-72 Main Battle Tank<br/>         SYRIAN MIG-23 Air Cover Aircraft<br/>         SOVIET AIR ASSAULT Infantry<br/>         SOVIET MI-24E Attack Helicopter<br/>         US MARINE CORPS M-60 Main Battle Tank<br/>         US NAVY F-14 Close Air Support Aircraft<br/>         &hellip;and many more.<br/>    <br/><br/><br/>",

It is a play-at-home version of the very popular participation game of the same name used by the Northampton Battlefield Society on its display stand at game shows and conventions.<br/><br/>The games has similar mechanisms to W1815 but with added non-military options. The players take alternate turns using one of their character cards. These enable the players to take historically plausible decisions whilst still retaining the ability to influence events to go in a different direction to the historical outcome.<br/><br/>The game enables the players to develop a clear narrative of the course of the battle , understanding the options available to the commanders, why the battle turned out as it did and how it might have had a different result. The victory point system also gives an explanation of how history would have changed if the battle had ended differently.<br/><br/>The game usually plays in less than 30 minutes and it is expected that players will alternate roles and compare their relative performances. Following the hard copy book selling out, the game has now been made available as a pdf download from Wargames Vault.<br/><br/>",

        "description": "Description from the designer:<br/><br/>The year is 1492. It is Sunday. The old pope is dead and now the race is on for the election of the new pope. You&rsquo;re one of the hopefuls in this election, however, not everyone is on your side&hellip; yet. But don&rsquo;t worry, they&rsquo;ll come around once you show them a little financial appreciation. After all, everyone has a vote, and everyone can be bought. And once the new pope is elected, the richest player wins&mdash;just like in real life.<br/><br/>The goal in Habeamus is to amass more money than the other players, while electing a new pope. Every player has one vote, and there are three non-player cardinals with a vote each as well. During their turns, players can place bribes face-down on the non-player cardinals in the middle of the playing field. These cardinals will vote for whomever promises the largest bribe when the vote starts.<br/>Each player also has a vote that they can use for themselves, or sell to other players. Every player can make hidden or open bribe offers to other players. If, during the vote count, a player accepts an offer by another player, that bribe goes into their account. However, if they do not accept the offer, the player making the offer gets the bribe into their account. In this way, players will have to balance their offers to other players and make sure they themselves sell their vote for a good price. To shake things up a bit more, a player can increase the papal salary, or play actions to change the bribes already on offer.<br/>Once all cards have been played, the votes are counted. If a pope is elected, he will receive a salary bonus into their account. Then, every player counts their money and the richest player wins.<br/><br/>",

        "description": "The German attack on Poland, codenamed &ldquo;Case White,&rdquo; on September 2nd, 1939 was a gamble on Hitler&rsquo;s part. He wagered Poland&rsquo;s allies of France and Great Britain would once again cave-in to his demands and not oppose his invasion. Even if they did, a lightning-fast war (blitzkrieg) would make mote any of their objections once the rival to the east was subjugated. That a mutual defense treaty stipulating an invasion from the east by the Soviet Union only &ldquo;sealed the deal&rdquo; and further secured Hitler&rsquo;s risk.<br/><br/>Lightning and Steel is a war game simulation of the climatic battle fought near the town of Piotrk&oacute;w Trybunalski during the 1939 invasion of Poland by Nazi Germany. Taking the crossroads town was crucial to the German&rsquo;s XVI Corps offensive. The Poles ordered their 1st and 2nd Tank Battalions, along with elements of two infantry and one cavalry divisions, to counter attack and cut off the Germans. The result was the war&rsquo;s first major tank battle, and one that nearly thwarted the German&rsquo;s plans. Can you do as well or better than you historical counterpart?

        "description": "Description from the publisher:<br/><br/>The Quick and the Dead (Q&amp;D) is meant to replicate the sharp, short actions involving coastal forces during World War II. More specifically, this set of rules and cards is focused on the fighting between coastal forces in the Mediterranean Sea, but if the rules prove popular, expansions for the English Channel and the Pacific theater are planned. It is important to recognize, however, that these rules focus on only a part of the operation of coastal forces. Coastal actions are characterized by patrolling and stealth, usually at night, punctuated by a quick, violent engagement at close quarters, often less than 500 yards.<br/><br/>Quick and the Dead features a unique diceless and turnless system in which players delcare and play action cards as fast as they can.  This creates an unusual tunnel vision phenomenon in which players are focused on the actions of their small craft and can be surprised when an enemy comes alongside and opens fire.  Games usually last between 30 and 45 minutes, so you can play two or three in an evening.<br/><br/>PT-boat actions are generally divided into three phases. There is the stealthy approach phase in which one force lies in wait, trying to get an advantageous position on the enemy. This phase can last several hours, beginning from the time the boats leave port until (and if) contact is made with the enemy. There is the assault phase, in which the boats battle each other, typically at fewer than 200 yards, and nearly always at night. This phase usually lasts between 20 and 40 minutes. Finally, there is the aftermath. Typically one side or the other affects a disengagement and both sides head from home.<br/><br/>The Quick and the Dead focuses on the middle phase. Games last about 40 minutes. There are no turns and no chart cards. Players use cards to control the movement and firing of their boats. All the needed information is on the cards. When a player has exhausted his cards, each of his boats makes a morale check, draws more cards, and continues playing. At the end of a game, players feel exhausted, as if they've just been through a fight.<br/><br/>If you like your naval games pedantic and chart-ridden, The Quick and the Dead is not for you. If you want to feel as if you've actually been in a PT fight, these are the only rules that give you that feeling. The game plays very different than most game you've played. Some players get the hang of the fluid, no-turns system quickly. Others have difficulty. I have found that by a player's third game, they get the hang of it. Many don't like the game the first time they play, but after playing a couple more times, really enjoy it. During play tests some have suggested that I should include an optional standard-style turn sequence. While players would be free to do so, I've decided not to include a tradtional turn sequence, because then The Quick and the Dead would be just another game, and I wanted it to be unique.<br/><br/>The Quick and the Dead comes with a rulebook, the cards to play the game, scenario cards, and boat record cards for most of the German, Italian, British, and American boat types in the Mediterranean. I usually play on a 4'x6' table, but that's for a six-player game. You could certainly play on a dining room table. The basic set of cards is for that size game. The advantage of the .pdf format is that if you want to player larger games (more players) you can print another deck of cards.<br/><br/>",

It can also be involuntarily, with the &quot;ward&quot; actually being a &quot;hostage&quot; for his or her clan's good behaviour or until a ransom is paid. Sometimes, as part of marriage alliances, one of the betrothed is taken as a ward so he or she can get to know his or her future spouse.

Who will place the most bricks of the same colour in a row, diagonally and touching?<br/>The bricks and the die of Wall to wall  are made of wood coming from eco-friendly forestry in respect of the natural and social environment. (100% FSC&reg;)<br/>Wall to wall is a safe, eco-friendly game realised with nontoxic paint and made in Italy.<br/>  <br/>COMPONENTS:  <br/>42 wooden bricks with colours on two sides<br/>1 wooden die with 6 sides<br/>1 instruction sheet<br/><br/>INSTRUCTIONS:<br/><br/>HOW TO BUILD THE WALL<br/>The bricks on the bottom row - the one touching the playing area &ndash; must be placed adjacent to one another, with a maximum of 10 bricks being used. From the second row up, each brick must be placed half over two different bricks. Unlike the first row, bricks do not need to be placed adjacent to each other. Only bricks that have no other bricks above them can be moved.<br/>RULES<br/>Goal: Place as many bricks as possible in your colour on your side of the wall in a row, diagonally and touching.<br/>PREPARATION AND STARTING<br/>The two players must sit facing each other, with the bricks placed to one side of the playing area in a pile. Each player choses one of the colours: green, fuchsia or light blue (the colour that is not chosen is neutral). Thefirst player to go is the one that, throwing the die, throws their colour first. After this, the players alternate turns. The wall is built between the two players. The bricks are placed such that the two coloured sides of the bricks face the players.<br/>TURNS<br/>The player whose turn it is throws the die and performs the corresponding action:<br/>- Green brick: Take a brick from the pile that has AT LEAST one green side and PLACE IT on the wall.<br/>- Fuchsia brick: PLACE a new brick that has AT LEAST one fuchsia side.<br/>- Light blue brick: PLACE a new brick that has AT LEAST one light blue side.<br/> - Little girl: PLACE a brick that has NO SIDES in your colour.<br/>- Grey brick: Take a brick from the WALL and MOVE it to where you want on the wall, or simply TURN IT AROUND.<br/>NB: Once a brick has been picked up, that brick is the one that must be moved or turned. If the wall hasn't yet been started, then you forfeit your turn.<br/>- Little boy: CHOOSE one of the actions from the five options. NB: If the action indicated on the die cannot be done (e.g., the die shows fuchsia, but all the bricks with at least one fuchsia side have already been used), then you forfeit your turn.<br/>END OF GAME<br/>The game ends when all the bricks have been placed on the wall. Points are awarded as follows: 10 points for the longest diagonal (in a player's colour on their side of the wall); 8 points for the longest row; 6 points for the most touching bricks. If there is a tie, then thepoints are shared (e.g. if both players have 8 touching bricks, then each one gets 3 points).<br/><br/>",

During the Exploration Phase, players push their luck by pulling cubes from a bag to travel along their locations, then push their luck further by flipping the location cards to reveal what they encounter there.  If too many dark world locations are revealed, then the players will face horrors from the encounter deck, where the dreaded Pyramid Head lurks...<br/><br/>",

While simple rules make it playable for children from the age of four, the game also has strategic aspects that make it just as enjoyable for adults.<br/><br/>Before beginning the game, place cards face-down in rows to create the board. Arrange each row to start and end at the halfway point of the starting and ending cards of the rows above and below in a double pyramid pattern.There should be a total of 7 rows, but players are free to arrange these rows into any shape they please (doesn't have to be a straight line).<br/><br/>Deal four cards to each player to form their hand. The player who doesn&rsquo;t go first is dealt one additional card. The remaining cards serve as the deck.<br/><br/>The players may then proceed to freely exchange the cards in their hand with cards from the row on the board closest to them to form their own &ldquo;base&rdquo;. After the cards making up the base have been chosen, these cards should be placed face up.<br/><br/>During a player&rsquo;s own turn, they may play a card from their hand that connects with the characters drawn upon one of the cards previously played faced up on the table.<br/><br/>If a face-down card is available where the player places their card, this card is taken into the player&rsquo;s hand. If a face up card is already placed where a player wishes to play their card, the player simply places their card on top of this card.<br/><br/>A player may chose to either place a card or pass and draw a card from the deck.

But runs and lifts only work in one direction, you must carefully plan your route for the day.<br/><br/>Whenever you pick up a stone, you also get a Snow Card, which can give you benefits like extra action tokens or a one-time-only ability.  Some Snow Cards let you help or hinder other players.<br/><br/>When going down runs, you can choose between easy green runs, intermediate blue runs, or advanced or expert black diamond runs.  The more difficult runs are faster, but you might fall and have to take a Wipeout Card, which can cause bad things to happen.<br/><br/>Advanced players can play with special characters that give each player a unique ability they can use throughout the game.<br/><br/>",

The game consists of deck of large cards with images associated with football and wooden ball token. Five of these cards laid on a table produce small board&mdash;football pitch&mdash;combined of five spaces.<br/><br/>The aim of the game is to score three goals. In order to score a goal the player have to move the ball to the utmost space in front of his or her opponent and win the decisive duel.<br/><br/>To move a ball or win a duel players compete, one trying to identify pairs of common symbols faster than their adversary. Ball may be moved from its space to adjacent one only if a player recognizes and names the only image, which these two spaces have in common. Before each move new card is played on board, putting new symbols in play.<br/><br/>Whoever scores third goal, wins the game. Teams may also determine that the game lasts until one team reaches a different, mutually agreed outcome or score more goals in the allotted time.<br/><br/>",

They mostly lived on the sea floor in shallow oceans, but some varieties lived in deeper water and on land in tidal regions.  They were highly diversified in physiology, habitat, and behavior &ndash; ranging from inches to feet in length,  some foraging, some hunting, some filter feeding, and some grazing.  Their closest living relative is the Horseshoe Crab, but all true trilobites went extinct by the end of the Permian.<br/><br/>Trilobite Dice recreates competition between different strains of trilobites as they populate the ocean shallows.  It is a cross between connection games (like Hex, Twixt, or Gonnect) and tactical dice games (like Roll Through the Ages, Octo Dice, or Pandemic: The Cure). It can be played competitively with 2 players or solo against an automated &lsquo;imposter&rsquo;.  Trilobite Dice is a print-and-play game, using consumable sheets of paper each game.<br/><br/>Players take turns rolling and rerolling special dice. The results of the dice provide resources to be allocate towards various special effects, including once-per-game bonus effects, ongoing special powers, and additional dice to roll on future turns. The players use these effects and powers to populate a hex map with their species, aiming to connect two opposite sides of the board before their opponent does so.  Some effects, such as buying extra dice, increase a player&rsquo;s hunger rating, which must be overcome before the player can win, so players must balance multiple objectives. The primary form of interaction between players is on the hex board, but some special powers create additional forms of interaction and alternate win conditions.  The game can be played in basic form, with just 20 special effects available, or advanced form with over 50 special effects to choose from (including more complex powers that combine to support additional tricks and strategies).<br/><br/>",

        "description": "September 1996 - This was a very unique set.  First and most odviously, every card in the set is a photo card, as opposed to just the usual chase set.  This set focused on two things.  Like the previous set, this booster focused on the old undead and made them fearsome again.  New unarmed combat cards for undead, and other boons to the previously alive are found through the set.  The other major theme is the two new card types: Thief champions and thief skills.  This made yet another card type to deal with (are rarely counter), but overall, it wasn't a huge effect yet.  Landmark Cards: Nelanther (#4); Falknovia (#5); Cromlin (#7); Assassin's Guild (#14); Cavern of Ancient Knowledge (#18); Complete Suprise (#25); The Guildmaster (#28); Jacqueline Renier (#32); Julio, Master Thief of Haslic (#34); El-Hadid (#40); Orcus (#44); Trumpet of Doom (#53); Herald of Mei Lung (#54); Use Poison (#63); Nemon hotep (#67); A Sure Thing (#74); Level Drain (#97); Bag of beans (c#11); Gib _________ (All designers, c#18-23); Den of Thieves (c#24); and Mad Scientist's Laboratory (c#25).<br/><br/>",

This supplement fully re-introduces the terrible mutant cannibal family as a fully playable warband, as well as a host of extra material.<br/><br/>The mutant cannibals are a nightmare come true. Living in twisted family clans, they raid wasteland settlements and seek the flesh of their foes. Led by the matriarch or the patriarch of the family, a host of gruesome family members are at your command. Whether it&rsquo;s the deceptively lovely Petunia, the simple, but gargantuan Tiny, or even the blood-crazed psychos who hold torture as an art form. The cannibal mutant warband also feature the ability to access to wasteland critters such a great rats, rad roaches, or the powerful psychic husk.<br/><br/>The mutant cannibals bring with them an array of deadly weaponry and deviant equipment. With everything from new vicious close combat weapons, to guns that literally boil the enemy alive with blood, and armor made out of the skin of their poor victims, the armory in this supplement is a true terror to behold. But don&rsquo;t lose all hope, other warbands can also use most of these weapons!<br/><br/>This supplement introduces two new scenarios: The Night Has Eyes and Snack Attack. Favoring the mutants chosen form of attack, these night raids feature the two most common cannibal themes, attacking your enemy while they sleep and raiding a settlement for a little nourishment. Of course these scenarios are definitely playable by other warbands and don&rsquo;t necessarily have to be about blood and guts, but why would you want that?<br/><br/>",

It seems that Mr. Alfred Worthapenny did not show himself at home for two days. He didn't show at work either, and friends report no sightings. After sending the woman home, you place a quick phone call to Commissioner Victor. After a short investigation, it turns out that the case is much more complicated that it seems. Lots of mutually exclusive evidence and a lack of connection between them &mdash; this looks strange. The Commissioner gathers his most trusted detectives. Time to solve the mystery of missing Alfred Worthapenny!<br/><br/>In Commissioner Victor: Case of Missing Alfred Worthapenny, players try to find out what happened to Mr. Alfred. They do so by placing evidence tiles in four colors on a grid. Each player has a different pattern to form from tiles of the same colors. Also, each player gets a tip that crosses out one possible outcome, which means that players cannot win with one of four colors.<br/><br/>",

        "description": "Players are aiming to get their secret wagers to earn the most points. It is played with a deck of 56 cards consisting of 2's to 7's from two packs of cards. Plus 1 King of each suit and 4 Jokers. Finally add the layout cards of 1 Ace of each suit and another Joker.<br/>The layout is placed on the table in this order from left to right:<br/>Club Ace, Spade Ace, Joker, Heart Ace and finally Diamond Ace<br/><br/>Each player is dealt 12 cards. From these he selects two cards which will be his secret 'wager'. He may choose two of the same suit or one each from two of the suits. His chosen cards are kept face-down in front of him.<br/><br/>The remaining 10 cards that a player has are used to influence or deter cards in the layout to get as far left as they can. Being a Knizia game the card play is quite novel and a little complex even.<br/><br/>When each player has used up his 10 cards, that ends the game. The secret 'wagers' are revealed. If the suits you picked are in the first 3 positions you get 3, 2, or 1 point (for 1st, 2nd and 3rd) if the black suits or Joker are in those positions. You score double points for red cards that get into the first 3 spots which reflects their 'start' at the back of the order from the Start. If a suit you bet on comes last you lose 3 points regardless of the colour.<br/><br/>The designer suggests that you play one hand equal to the number of players and the player at the end with the most points, wins.<br/><br/>",

        "description": "From the Avalanche Press website:<br/><br/>At the end of the Great War, the German High Seas Fleet was interned at Scapa Flow at the northern tip of Scotland as a guarantee of the November 11th Armistice. Within weeks, French leaders were demanding that at least a portion of the ships, if not all of them, be handed over to France as compensation for the destruction wrought on French soil during the war. The discussions came to an end in June 1919, when the German sailors still aboard the ships scuttled them rather than see them flying enemy flags or worse, displayed in victory celebrations.<br/><br/>Victoire is a variant for U.S. Navy Plan Gold, in which the French have successfully received the most extreme of their demands: all of the most modern German battleships, battle cruisers and light cruisers. Newly refitted and ready for action, these vessels join the French fleet projecting the Republic&rsquo;s naval power into the Caribbean basin. With the addition of 14 formerly German dreadnoughts and six cruisers, the Marine Nationale is now a match for the U.S. Navy. The Monroe Doctrine is about to become a dead letter.<br/><br/>The Harvest 2015 Golden Journal includes twenty new laser-cut, mounted pieces depicting these ships in Great War at Sea format. They bear French livery and new names, and revised artwork. It&rsquo;s a good-looking set. Plus you get scenarios for their use.<br/><br/>",

They utilise a lot of AOE to control space and deny their opponents manoeuvrability. Their combo play comes from layering AOEs and generating huge areas of danger across the pitch.<br/><br/>They are quick on their feet and capable with the ball, but not as resilient in combat as other teams. They excel in the early to mid-game due to their ability to cover a good amount of space.<br/><br/>Alchemists will reward players who can anticipate their opponent&rsquo;s plans and block them through good placement and positioning of models and effects. On offense, Alchemists can use their AOEs almost as additional models in order to restrict the counter play options of their opponent. No one wants to charge the Alchemist with the ball if you have to go through an acid cloud!<br/><br/>What nature provides, man can improve. The Alchemists know this well and it is reflected in the scientific marvels they bring to the Guild Ball pitch. Watching the Alchemists play is part carnival, part fireworks, part illusion. The crowds cheer in awe at the visual spectacle as fireballs, smoke clouds, and slick oils dominate the field of play, delighting the children, decimating the opposition.<br/><br/>Flexibility is the watchword of an Alchemist's Guild coach. In Midas, Calculus, and Mercury you have all the ingredients for the purest of alloys, a team that can be much greater than the sum of its parts. Whether you are blinding the enemy with oil or turning them into little more than human candles, the Alchemists will always have a response to any play; their vast knowledge putting them one step ahead of the rest of the pack with every kick of the ball.<br/><br/>This set provides you with all you need to start playing the Alchemist's Guild.<br/><br/>",

Mid-game is where they really shine - once well laid plans have turned to mush, Morticians can begin to dictate the play.<br/><br/>Morticians provide an interesting take on &lsquo;force projection&rsquo; by making their opponents consider how and where they&rsquo;re going to position models.<br/><br/>Morticians will reward players who like to dominate and control the game by playing mind tricks on their opponents.<br/><br/>They say that form is temporary; class is forever.

        "description": "Final Round Fighting Card Game is a two-player card game which emulates Arcade Fighting Games of the 90s.<br/><br/>In Final Round Fighting Card Game, players play cards to simulate attacking and defending against their opponent as they attempt to deal damage to one-another, removing cards from their opponents deck as damage is done. The players deck is made up of cards, each of which represent a move the character they are playing as is able to perform. Cards lost from the deck through damage become a resource from which players draw.<br/><br/>As with Arcade Fighting Games, there are Basic Attacks (simple 1-button punches and kicks), Special Attacks (more complicated or specialized moves, frequently unique to a character), Basic Block and Special Blocks (Basic Block is reusable throughout the game, Special Blocks have an additional effect) and Ultimate moves (the big, flashy finishers).<br/><br/>Cards/Moves in Final Round Fighting Card Game are balanced by i. Attack Speed (how fast a card is), ii. Combo Speed (the maximum Attack Speed of the card to follow it in a Combo), iii. Damage (the number of cards your opponent loses from their deck when they're hit with the attack alone or in a Combo), and iv. Card Abilities.<br/><br/>Gameplay consists of playing cards defensively to your own High, Mid, and Low zones, or playing a card aggressively to Attack your opponent in one of their three zones (the zones are largely thematic, to represent the &quot;spacing&quot; aspect from fighting video games). Attacks are successful when they are faster than the card in the zone they were played to, with Blocks being an automatic success for the defending player, and ties being broken by revealing the top card of players' decks and using the Attack Speed of the revealed card. On successfully attacking the opponent, players have the ability to play additional cards, making a Combo, with each successive card in a Combo requiring having an Attack Speed which is equal to or less than the Combo Speed of the last card which was played. During a players turn, they have two Actions, in which they can play defensively to draw cards and reset their defenses, or to attack.<br/><br/>&mdash;description from the designer<br/><br/>",

Can you breach the Russian defences and seize the initiative in the East, or will you defeat the fascist invaders and restore the safety of the motherland.<br/><br/>Twenty-seven pages long, this Pint Sized campaign provides the background history to the campaign with situation maps.  Uses period maps to show the location of the actions and then provides a complete campaign with forces for both sides, support options for players to select from and full victory conditions for all six battles and the campaign as a whole.<br/><br/>",

        "description": "A simulator of karma. Magical game with dices and cards.<br/>That is a unique game about rebirth, desires and karma. As a bonus, a solo mode for fortune telling and cooperative mode without conflicts.<br/><br/>Brief description of the game<br/><br/>The ancient sages have said: &ldquo;we are alive only if we have desires&rdquo;. Someone has a lot of dreams, other has only one dream, but everyone who lives in our world constantly wants something. It&rsquo;s a pity, but accomplishment of  desires  is not a simple thing. Sometimes we need to do any serious actions. These actions can be as good, as bad. And our actions develop karma, which can be as light, as dark due to our desires...<br/><br/>In the game 7 Desires''we become souls embodied in our world. There are many disadvantages in this world. For example, illness and death. Therefore, every player wants to leave this cruel world as quickly as possible. We would like to liberate the soul, and, of course, fulfill all the desires which have brought us here.<br/><br/>The world is multilevel. Souls rise, and then fall, because they are so different! There is a plan of being for each level of consciousness.<br/>In the beginner of the game everyone starts at the level of human being.<br/><br/>To win the game 7 Desires, you just need to move from the level of human being to the level of angels, then to the level of the gods. And when all the desires of the divine level are accomplished, you can go home, away from the world of births and deaths. We wish you good luck with that!<br/><br/>In summary, every turn looks like this: a player draws a card, fills his hand with three cards, and then plays one card, placing it in the discard deck face -up. This card becomes an active desire. Next step, the player chooses whether he wants to accomplish this desire. If yes, then he discards the crystal (s) of desires indicated in the upper left corner of the card, and if he does not want to accomplish the desire, he adds to his avatar the item which is indicated in the upper right corner of the card. If it is more than one crystal on the left, you do not need to reset all the crystals. You can have any number of crystals indicated on the card. For example, accomplishing of &quot;A cherished Desire&quot; you can reset 1, 2 or 3 red crystals.<br/><br/>If you have accomplished the desire, then karma comes for the actions you have taken to. This karma is described at the bottom of the card. All the received karma is placed under your avatar. Clearly pointed crystals (white and black) of karma are simply added, and undefined karma (tricolor crystals) is played with 3 dices of dark, light and red colors. The result is determined by the largest value of the dice. If the largest number falls on a light dice, light karma is added, if it is dark on the dark one, and if the red cube &quot;won&quot;, then at the value of 5 and 6 - you add an additional desire crystal, and for 1, 2, 3 or 4 &ndash; one crystal of desire is removed. If two of three dices have the same value, the third is always considered to work, even if it has a lower value than the other two.

After generating a fiction setting together, players take on the roles of dynamic but recognizable spec-fic archetypes.<br/><br/>Drawing episode frameworks from a plotline deck, players collaboratively create an episodic epic of conflict and romance. By bidding clich&eacute;s on each episode they capture keywords associated with their hidden motivations and compete to see who has final say on the fate of their story.<br/><br/>While there is no winner, per se, the character who secured the most of their keywords reveals the post session denouement of their character last, getting final say on plot outcomes.<br/><br/>",

Every turn there are three cards in your path that can be one of three types: enemy, location or event. When you roll the dice you can assign pairs of dice with total value that matches exactly the rank of the card in order to overcome it. Undefeated enemies deal you damage and so do the locations that are in your path more then one turn due to fatigue. Unresolved events make you lose resources that you can gain when defeating enemies. You can also spend your resources to travel easier through locations.

Cards have a points value between 1 and 5 and 1 of 2 types of abilities (cards used in combination with each other or cards that initiate an event/activity).  Abilities activate as soon as the card is played.<br/><br/>Each player starts with 2 cards and then take turns to draw 1 card from the deck and play 1 card from their hand.  When a card is played it is placed face up on the table in front of the player.  If the card has a non-combo ability (e.g. discard 1 group, steal character, draw 1 card etc.) this gets used immediately. All the cards in front of you are known as your Fief.<br/><br/>When the last card is drawn the discard is shuffled and cards drawn from it (cards only ever go into the discard pile when another card sends them there).  When there is no deck or discard left, players continue taking turns, playing one card at a time from their hands until all cards are played.  At this point scoring is undertaken.<br/><br/>Cards score their basic points value but if they are combo cards may score extra points if the player holds the right combination of cards. The final scores are based on all the cards in your Fief and the combos they make. The winner is the player with the most points at the end of the game.<br/><br/>",

They also receive additional starting stats through the pre-game phase.<br/><br/>During the pre-game phase players place one pawn each on the start space of the Pre-History track which has 23 spaces (including the start).  Players take turns rolling the die and moving their pawns forward along the track. When a player lands on a space they get the indicated boosts to their stats. They also put a marker on the space. If a player lands on a space that already has a marker they move to any space of their choice. When every space on the Pre-History Track has been marked the pre-game ends.<br/><br/>During the main game turns are conducted over a series of 16 phases, with players taking turns within each phase.  During most phases each player will roll one die and move along the indicated track (i.e. during the leader phase, players move on the leader track). Players gets the stat bonuses as described in the space they land on. Certain phases allow players to increase population size in exchange for resources, trade with other players, or declare war on other players in an attempt to steal territory from them.<br/><br/>The game ends when anyone reaches 20 or more territories. If a player ever goes to zero territory or population he automatically loses.  At the end of the game, the player with the most Victory Points wins.<br/><br/>",

The other two games in the series are Election 1960 and DEFCON 1: The Cuban Missile Crisis.<br/><br/>The Game is played over a period of 4 Rounds, with 10 turns per Round.  The solitaire player, takes the part of Kennedy as he tries to successfully complete missions against the Japanese in the Solomon Islands in 1943.  Each Round has several phases, which include drawing cards which represent Random Events, Missions, and possible contact with Japanese military units, such as Barges, Destroyers, Aircraft attacks, etc.  If Contact is made it leads to a Combat phase.<br/><br/>Once the player knows what his orders are (his Mission he must complete), he must prepare his PT boat for the mission.  This includes a series of decisions as to the amount of fuel, ammunition, medical supplies, etc. that he will need to increase his chance of success.  Victory Points are accumulated over the four rounds to determine if the player has scored enough points to win the game.<br/><br/>",

This corridor can be used to place the large flying beast in the center of the cave.<br/><br/>On top of the regular 'static' challenges, the flying Ice Skeleton presents an extra moving obstacle affecting its surroundings.<br/>Each turn the beast moves 1 or 2 positions through the cave. Based on the strengths and weaknesses of the beast, players need to strategically plan and time their route through the cave.<br/><br/>",

With four players, NYX plays as two partnerships.<br/><br/>In NYX, you assume role of an immortal Scion locked in an eternal struggle to influence mortal thoughts.  Take the side of Morpheus, God of Dreams and bearer of prophetic visions.  Or take the side of Morpheus&rsquo; menacing brother, Phobia, bringer of phantasms and nightmares.  Use your powers of prophetic dreams, nightmarish phantasms, powerful rifts, and enchanted cloaks in a clash for control of the ancient realm known as the Dream Plain.<br/><br/>The goal of NYX is to gain the most Victory Points.  You earn Victory Points by composing Divinations to collect Poppies and by building connected territories on the Dream Plain of either Nightmare or Prophecy.  Final scoring is based on the amount of area controlled and the number of Poppies cached.<br/><br/>The game of NYX is inspired by the legend Morpheus and Phobia.  They are brothers and scions of ancient gods:<br/>Their father is Hypnos, the gentle, black-winged God of Sleep; twin to the Lord of Death; and &lsquo;balm to the mortal soul.&rsquo;  Their mother is Nyx, the frighteningly fierce and powerful primordial Goddess of Night borne of original Chaos, her overwhelming might revered and feared by all other gods...even Zeus himself.<br/>  <br/>The sons of Nyx and Hypnos dwell within an immense cavern buried in the deepest chasm of the Underworld.  Each night, Phobia, always envious of Morpheus&rsquo; renown, wages a great war with his formidable brother.  Since the beginning of time, while mortal men slumber, the two scions have been locked in an eternal struggle vying for absolute control of mortal visions and dreams.  At sundown, the two race from the depths of the Underworld as a cyclone rising like a smokey mist of bats. The two brothers hurtle towards their battle and their destiny on the Dream Plain.<br/><br/>",

Outmatched in every meaningful category of economic, political and military power, sometimes by astronomical margins, Japan never had a chance to win a military victory in the Second World War. No amount of battlefield valor could change the final outcome and the Empire's defeat was only a matter of time.<br/><br/>Co-Prosperity Sphere is an expansion book for our Great Pacific War game that studies what circumstances might have given Imperial Japan an opportunity to match American power. It&rsquo;s part of our Long War naval game setting, which includes Second World War at Sea: Plan Z. In this alternative history, Japan has greatly increased her power and rules an Empire of 153 million people while holding firm political and economic dominion over the puppet Chinese Empire as well.<br/><br/>Co-Prosperity Sphere includes six new scenarios and 90 new playing pieces to bring this setting to Great Pacific War. This is not a complete game; ownership of Great Pacific War is required to play these scenarios.<br/><br/>",

But watch out for the volcano looming over the island...it might destroy everything!<br/><br/>Dice Age: Eggstinction is an entry level strategy game for 2-5 young/new game players and families to introduce them to contemporary game concepts like player asymmetry, resource collection, tech trees, and victory points. Players chose from a variety of dinosaur species and move around an island gathering goods in order to produce eggs...the first to produce 6 eggs in their nest wins the game! On your turn you'll roll a bunch of giant dice to populate the island with resources like insects, ferns, ginko, meat, and fish. Then you'll move around the island (possibly using your dino's unique ability) and gather up those resources to feed and grow your broods to produce more eggs. As you nest fills up, you'll gain new and enhanced skills to help you on your journey. But be careful when you gather goods from the dangerous areas of the island, as the volcano might erupt laying waste to valuable goods and scaring you back to safety.<br/><br/>Double-sided components are designed to enable competitive play between gamers and non/early-gamers at the same time and let young kids grow into the game by watching and learning from older players.<br/><br/>",

Each player takes on the role of a Dinosaur (the deck has three carnivores and three herbivores). Your goal as the Dinosaur is to get as many Victory Points as possible by Biting, Clawing, Stomping, and Smashing the pesky, trophy-seeking Victorian Hunters as they sip their tea and eat their lunch.<br/><br/>A game takes about 15-20 minutes to play. Each player is dealt three Hunters that they are racing against their opponents to complete. You complete a Hunter by matching (in order) all of the symbols on the Hunter&rsquo;s card with your Attack cards, while trying to use the best Victory Point card on each Hunter.<br/><br/>Each Hunter is also looking to catch a specific Dinosaur (that upper left hand corner image of the Dinosaur on Sergei&rsquo;s card). If a player completes a Hunter that was looking to catch them, they earn double points.<br/><br/>But watch out! There are special cards that allow your opponent to steal your Attack Cards or even swap your Hunter with theirs (getting all the associated Victory Points as well)!<br/><br/>Team Play and Simple Play (for young kids) As there are three Carnivores and three Herbivores in the deck, players can split into two teams and compete together, rather than playing a free-for-all. Also, if you ignore the VP and specials, you can use the game as a simple color/symbol matching game with younger children&ndash;work them up to Victory Points after they learn math skills and finally teach them the Special Rules when they have mastered Victory Points.<br/><br/>",

Now it's your turn to shine as you remake your favorite zombie classics.<br/><br/>Adventures is Zombiewood is a cooperative game where players each command a different actor each turn.  They use the actor to take on the Z-lebrities that spawn during each Scene they are shooting.  They roll dice in an attempt to match the symbols required to defeat the Z-lebrity.  Anytime a player is unable to defeat the Z-lebrity, their actor is zombified and joins the growing horde to be faced in the game's final scene.  Combat must be fast (as you are trying to conserve film reel) so each combat phase is timed, and all players must be finished with their attack rolls before the timer signals the end of the scene.  Team strategy and quick thinking will give you a chance to survive to the end of your movie.  How many stars will your film earn... and will you survive to find out?<br/><br/>",

The players assign various actions for their kids to perform, including finding a suitable tree, gathering tools, and constructing various parts of the treehouse. The kids can be assigned to work alone, or in teams of two to four. The more kids assigned to a task, the greater the chance of success. There is no direct player interaction, just a competition to finish the task first.<br/><br/>The Treehouse Building Game was originally designed in 2003, in conjunction with a re-reading of the Mad Scientists' Club stories, and was first released as a print-and-play design in 2017.<br/><br/>",

As the crisis unfolds, players will try to use a combination of diplomacy and military posturing in a bid to claim victory without the situation devolving into a conflict that could leave both sides in ruins.<br/><br/>Players attempt to reduce their opponent's resolve and control regional tension by playing diplomacy and progress cards. When tension rises above certain levels, players receive more progress cards and the crisis develops, yet these cards are the most powerful way to reduce opposition resolve. Each decision could have far-reaching consequences and the challenge is to claim victory in the crisis without both sides destroying each other.<br/><br/>&mdash;description from the designer<br/><br/>",

        "description": "In the near future, humanity suffers an existential threat in the form of a highly negative first contact with an alien race. The result is the Seeding &ndash; an alien invasion, but not a normal one. The invasion comes not in high-tech assault, but in a massive injection of foreign species, many only semi-intelligent.<br/><br/>Westhope centers around the actions of eight main characters who, through your actions, attempt to survive and resist.<br/><br/>Westhope is not simply a board game. It is a cluster of multiple games containing a common core mechanic called the Plan. For example, during a period the characters may be attempting to search for refugees over a wide area. They play a Journey mission. They search, evade or face enemies, working to survive while journeying over a large area. The next mission may be penetrating a facility, and they instead play a Tactical mission, where play style is more tactical RPG game with the Plan at its core. During Interludes, a specialized form of choose-your-own-adventure sets the characters and their allies on different paths, and pulls you into their lives so that they are far more than simply stats.<br/><br/>Westhope will have nearly every style of play available. Its core is an ambitious campaign where you truly begin to empathize with the characters and their allies (and enemies). However, players can engage in separate solo, cooperative, or competitive modes in each of the individual board game elements.<br/><br/>The campaign spans months and years, and expansions continue the story, some adding new board game methods to play.<br/><br/>&mdash;description from the publisher<br/><br/>",

        "description": "The board has a square grid on the four sides, numbers 2 to 12. In the middle, 10 wooden trees are randomly placed and, at random, one pawn per player. Then each player rolls two dice, sums them up and places on one of the four boxed number one of the 10 wooden game animals. At this point you have to move the animal with the result of either of the two dice. With the other die you can do one of the following: cancel it and do nothing; move his pawn orthogonally, in the desired direction; move another animal already on the board, in the direction of the head. At the end of these movements, if the pawn of the turn player is orthogonally within 4 boxes from an animal (or even more than one) without the line of sight being obstructed, he can &quot;snap a photo&quot; by picking the corresponding card from the deck . The first one who manages to collect ten photos of the ten different animals won the game.<br/><br/>",

Players can also land on squares that allow them to bet other players on how many of a certain exercise they can do.

To do this, they created a demonic portal over a pentagram with magical gestures. As the rite progressed, some acolytes soon became clear with horror that they were not capable enough to keep these demonic circle upright. What happened to them was not handed down. But now you are in possession of this old rune tome. So what will you do?<br/><br/>In SIGNS, 3 to 9 players try to sustain a sequence of numbers with their hands in each round. They are obliged to follow the rules imposed on them by runes. Each round comes with a further card, so the rules become more and more extensive. Anyone who shows a wrong sign and is caught by the other players must leave the circle. Only the bravest and cleverest summoner will succeed in maintaining the ritual to the end.<br/><br/>SIGNS is the first publication of Rocky Bogdanski, finalist of the 2016 Young Author scholarship and his co-author Kai Wetzel.<br/><br/>&mdash;description from the publisher<br/><br/>",

Kobolds move parallel to the edges of the board. Goblins move diagonally. The monster player gets a piece for each player, and may move each piece 1 time per turn. Monsters controlled by another player can hunt players for points. Each player is worth 5 points to the monster player.<br/>Players control peices that navigate an 8&quot;x8&quot; board using dice to determine if a space is a trap, a wall, or a hall. Sometimes player obtain treasure or gold. Gold is used to determine points at the end of the game. Treasure is represented by cards drawn from the treasure deck. Players determine the effect a treasure has when it is used. This causes the treasures to change each game. The game concludes after all players have exited or have been captured. The surviving player with the most points wins.<br/><br/>",

        "description": "It's Medieval Crazy Eights! Cards are powerful when possessed in numbers, but only the first player to discard them all wins the game.<br/><br/>The game of Kingship uses an 80 card deck ranging in card values from Ace to King and contains 3 various suits (Light, Dark, and Terra). Players must compete against their opponents to become the first player to use (or lose) all of their cards. Anyone familiar with the popular card game &quot;Crazy Eights&quot; with be able to jump into a game of Kingship right off the bat. Match the suit or number value to play a card and trigger its awesome card abilities! It is important to remember however that the closer you are to victory, the greater the chance you will become a target. That is why it's often a good idea to remain passive at the start and wait for another player to make the first move. For once a Queen is declared, any player may acquire Kingship, and from there, they can literally change the rules of the game.<br/><br/>",

When the alphabet card is turned over, everyone must think of something that starts with the letter and matches one of the four categories. If a player has an answer, he or she must slam their hand on the category card and say their connection to win that card.<br/><br/>For example, the four categories are Action Movie, Ice Cream Flavor, Biblical Name and Vampire.

You buy companies and set up start-ups in eligible industries, get profit or sell your company if right the moment has come. You may even try to make a corporate raid. Doing all that you have to acquire your business reputation symbolized by the Stars - special game chips - that's how you score your points. <br/> The game board represents 11 industries (agriculture, telecom, raw materials, etc). Each industry is marked with a die roll number. Each move players throw dices, the roll of the dice denotes an active industry in which players can bid for a company (private or public), start start-ups or sell their companies. Each player who owns a company in the industry marked with the number rolled or in a neighbor industry receives profit. <br/> There are three decks of cards: options, events and crises. Option cards give additional advantages to a player, event cards hit all the players (negatively or positively) and crisis cards may turn your profit into a loss. <br/> Main features:<br/> <br/>     A unique compound game board. Each time you will have a new game!<br/>     You won't get bored waiting for your turn, each move players interact with each other. <br/>     Each move you have to make decisions: how to invest in the industry (buy a company or set a start-up), when to increase your financial leverage, sell your company in a crisis industry or increase your share when prices plunge<br/>     Two game modes: a quick game (30 minutes, good for playing with kids) and a full game (1,5-2 hours).<br/><br/><br/>&mdash;description from the publisher<br/><br/>",

        "description": "PORT-EN-BESSIN, NORMANDY, 7 June 1944: Port-en-Bessin was a little fishing harbor west of Arromanches in Normandy, it was situated between two landing zones, Omaha Beach the American sector, and Gold Beach the XXXth British Corps sector. The 47th Royal Marine Commando came ashore east of Arromanches and progressed toward Port-en-Bessin; at night the Commando stopped a few kilometers from the objective. On 7 June the British launched the attack with fighter bombers support; about forty men were killed to capture the harbor's western side. On 8 June British commandos liberated Port-en-Bessin and linked up with Americans from the 29th I.D.<br/>Welcome to ATS Port-en-Bessin! Even some of our vaunted tactical-level gaming compatriots may not realize that a house-to-house battle took place as part of the Normandy Invasion. The place was Port-en-Bessin, a small but important fishing town that was to be the objective for the 47 (RM) Commandos ... an amazing group of soldiers that would suffer heavy casualties in the operation. One source put it this way, &quot; About two miles outside Port-en-Bessin, you'll reach a wooded hill with a grassy crown covered with orchids called Mont Cavalier. It was here that the surviving men of 47 RM Commando spent the night of D-Day, the twin peaks of the Eastern and Western features brooding ominously on the horizon. They had supplemented their weapons with German Schmeissers and Spandaus, captured in firefights along the way.<br/>On the morning of June 7, they had got safely through the outer defences and headed into the port when disaster struck. While clambering up the steep slopes of the Western feature, one of their troops was caught out by withering fire from two German Flak ships, which were unexpectedly moored in the harbour. Eleven men were killed, 17 wounded and one &ndash; George Amos &ndash; captured. Meanwhile, back on Mont Cavalier, the unit's rear HQ was overrun.<br/>By the evening of June 7, the Commando was in a desperate position: isolated and under constant threat of counterattack from numerically superior enemy forces; low on ammunition, depleted by heavy casualties and exhausted after two days' fighting with no more than two hours' sleep. And still those impregnable features loomed. &quot;<br/>To make things easy for you to get YOUR boots on the ground, a complete set of a set ofcombat counters is provided -- and a mission that will test your tactical-level mettle!

        "description": "From Malifaux Wiki<br/><br/>Bishop, Outcast Enforcer<br/><br/>Overview<br/>Bishop is a Mercenary pit fighter whose main claims to fame are Swift, granting him a third AP, and a handful of useful triggers that make him quite effective in a variety of different situations. <br/>Table of Contents<br/>Overview<br/>Mobility<br/>Offense<br/>Resilience<br/>Upgrades<br/>Tactics and Tips<br/>Playing Against Bishop<br/><br/>Mobility<br/><br/>While Bishop's Walk of 4 is a bit of the slow side, his Charge of 7 makes up for it by letting him move quickly into combat. He's also Swift, granting him 3 AP during each of his activations, which allows him to move further than one might otherwise think after glancing at his stats.<br/><br/>Offense<br/><br/>Bishop is a melee-focused model, and that's where he shines.<br/><br/>His main attack is Chain Wrapped Fist, which has a high Ml of 6 but a damage spread of 2/3/4, which is a bit low for a model of his price. However, Bishop makes up for that with a variety of triggers which make him very versatile, and his Study Opponent ability allows him to target either Wp or Df, allowing him to both hit his opponent where they are weakest and to bypass a number of defensive triggers (such as Lady Justice's Riposte trigger, which only triggers on her Df flips, but not her Wp flips).<br/><br/>Bishop also possesses the Adaptive ability, which lets him choose a suit when he activates and add that suit to each of his duel totals during that activation. This makes Bishop very independent from the suits in your hand and essentially lets him pick which of his suits he wants to guarantee hitting during that activation. This also provides him a bit of defense from enemies that strip printed suits (such as Hannah or the Freikorps Librarian), as the suit gained from Adaptive is not considered to be printed on his card.<br/><br/>The triggers on Chain Wrapped Fist allow Bishop to quickly adapt to whatever enemy his is fighting. Penetrating Blow ignores Armor, Hard to Kill, and Incorporeal, Choke Out makes his opponent Slow, Knock Around pushes his opponent 3&quot; in any direction, and Critical Strike just increases his damage by +1 for each Ram in his final dual total. With a flipped or cheated Ram and a Ram from Adaptive, this can increase Bishop's damage spread to 4/5/6, which is pretty impressive for a model with 3 AP!<br/><br/>Bishop's second attack is Haymaker, which costs 2 AP and doesn't deal any damage, but does make the target Paralyzed if it connects. It has a very high Ml of 7, making it a very accurate attack, especially when used as a Disengaging Strike.<br/><br/>Finally he has Flurry. This allows him to spend 2 AP and discard a card to get 3 Ml attacks against a single target. They will all have to be Chain Wrapped Fists as Flurry only allows Bishop to take attacks costing 1 AP.<br/><br/>Resilience<br/><br/>Bishop has higher than average defensive stats and a good number of wounds, which makes him difficult to kill in the best of situations. He's even harder to take down in melee, as his Cage Fighter defensive trigger deals 1/2/4 damage to anyone that makes a Ml attack against him and misses. The Crow he needs to hit his trigger is already built into his Defense, so he can Cage Fighter every attack that fails to strike him. Because of this, Defensive Stance is a good option with Bishop once he's in melee, as it improves his chances of dodging an attack (and thus counter-attacking via Cage Fighter) and still leaves him with 2 AP to fight back.<br/><br/>Upgrades<br/><br/>Bishop has two upgrades available to him in Outcasts.<br/><br/>Scramble increases his WK and Cg, which becomes even better on Bishop, as he has a third AP with which to get even more extra movement out of the upgrade.<br/><br/>Oathkeeper can be discarded at the start of Bishop's activation to give him Fast. If you thought that Bishop with 3 AP was good, 4 AP is even better. With it he can charge and flurry in the same activation, Charge twice, or Flurry twice.<br/><br/>When hired into Arcanists, the Imbued Protection upgrade will make Bishop have Df 7. This makes attacking Bishop in melee a huge risk, as he's just that much more likely to avoid the attack and hit his opponent right back with Cage Fighter.<br/><br/>With Guild, Lead Lined Coat grants Bishop Armor +1, which only serves to make him that much harder to kill.<br/><br/>Resurrectionists have Decaying Aura available to them, which punishes any model that lingers too close to Bishop for very long. Because Bishop is so difficult to escape in melee, this can be a viable option for those who like to toss him into the thick of things.<br/><br/>When hired into Ten Thunders, Recalled Training becomes an option, granting Bishop a +flip to all duels he makes for the rest of the turn. Because of his third AP, and his ability to counter-attack models that fail to strike him with Ml attacks, this upgrade makes Bishop very scary for one turn.<br/><br/>Tactics and Tips<br/><br/>Bishop is a melee-focused model, so try to get him into the thick of things as soon as possible. He does very well against weaker enemies that are likely to miss him and trigger his Cage Fighter counterattack, but can also hold his own against Henchman and Enforcers (particularly if he focuses on using Haymaker to paralyze them).<br/><br/>When you activate Bishop, take a moment to consider which triggers you need the most and then gain the appropriate suit via Adaptive. Remember that you can still use the suits from cards that you flip or cheat, so don't feel constrained by Adaptive if you need to hit different triggers during his activation or if the situation changes unexpectedly.<br/><br/>Playing Against Bishop<br/><br/>Bishop is a very versatile model that can be used in many ways. You don't really want to get engaged with him if you can help it, as his Df trigger makes him risky to attack with Ml attacks, and his high Ml makes it hard to disengage from him. Shoot him with ranged weapons when possible.<br/><br/>",

Game play involves throwing two dice to determine which tiles to use, and once placed, they may not be rearranged (tiles may be discarded, or refused). Throwing a six allows you to steal a tile from another player.<br/><br/>With dice, there is an element of luck, but strategic play can help mitigate this. Games are comparatively short so they are ideal fillers between more complicated longer games. Sometimes gameplay can be frenetic.

At his age they are very skilled at recognizing the many emotions vital to their social development. Joy, sorrow, anger and fear are four basic emotions underlying social interaction. This game provides an excellent opportunity for you to accompany little ones in this new way of interacting with others through a simplified game designed just for them. With its two levels of difficulty, this association game will follow children as they progress.<br/>The aim of the game is to fill the illustrated game boards with the emotion-disks. At first the child is just playing a matching game on their own which introduces them to emotions. In multi-player form each player gets a board and on your turn you turn over a disk. If a player has that disk on their board they get to keep it otherwise is it set aside. In the more advanced version you only keep the disk if it is on your board otherwise you put it back face down. The first player to fill their game board wins.<br/><br/>",

So, for instance, if there are 3 free spaces in the play area and players have 3 cards in their hands (one player with 2 cards; the other, 1 card), no more cards can<br/><br/><br/>be overlapped.<br/><br/>     If there are no free spaces and you have a card whose number is lower than the numbers of the cards in the play area, that card is out of the game.<br/>     The game ends when all the cards are played and the winner is the one with most virus or leukocytes on the board. In case of a tie, play again.<br/><br/><br/>",

Each player has a hand of 4 cards; first player draws a new card and discards directly to the next player, who must take that card and discard to the next, etc. When the final player has drawn, s/he discards to a discard deck, and the beginning player draws a new card from the draw deck. As soon as one player has acquired a full 4-of-a-kind set, they discard and then claim a bone from the table, which triggers a mad dash on the part of the other players to grab the remaining bones. The slowest to claim a bone is eliminated from the game each round, leaving a single winning player.<br/><br/>This version differs from regular Spoons because that one requires players to simultaneously transfer cards to the left while accepting cards from the right, while this version has one player drawing then discarding at a time, and progressing around the table, one player at a time. Furthermore, the rules about being a &quot;pig&quot; and then a &quot;hog&quot; are nowhere in the Disney version,<br/><br/>",

        "description": "Spots is a traditional Irish card game. A bit similar to Rummy, but older. Designed for four players, but can be played with three players using a 'dead hand' or with five players if the dealer 'sits out'.<br/><br/>Using a standard 52-card deck, each player is given eight cards and each turn a player must first draw a card from either the deck or the discard pile. A maximum of four cards may be laid on the table, either as a new set or connected to any existing set. At the end of the turn a player must discard a card from hand. Thus each player can make no more then two sets each game.<br/><br/>When a player has no more cards or when the deck is depleted, the game ends and players receive penalty points for all cards in hand. These are equal to the number of spots on each card, hence the name of the game. To clarify: Ace=1, 2=2, 3=3..., jack/queen/king=10 penalty points.<br/><br/>Additional rules: The ace is always low, so cannot go behind a king of the same suit. A player may play a double, which is extremely rare. These are exactly eight connecting cards of the same suit. The discard pile may not be spread out but the deck may be in order to know how many turns may be left.<br/><br/>",

The great empires survived, yet the peace proved flawed and world-wide war returned in 1940. That war is the background of our Second Great War at Sea series.<br/><br/>Tropic of Capricorn is a complete boxed game in the Second World War at Sea series, bringing our alternative-history Second Great War story arc to the shores of South America. Argentina, assisted by Chile and Britain, faces off against Brazil in a naval war in the South Atlantic.<br/><br/>Tropic of Capricorn includes one 22x34-inch operational map, the same &ldquo;Rio de Janeiro&rdquo; map included in our old Cone of Fire game (which will soon go permanently out of print). It covers the most important politically- and economically-important stretches of the Argentine and Brazilian coastlines including Buenos Aires and Rio de Janeiro.<br/><br/>Tropic of Capricorn also has 180 new silky-smooth and die-cut playing pieces: 100 &ldquo;long&rdquo; ship pieces and 80 standard-sized ones representing small warships and aircraft as well as task force and flight markers. These represent the fleets of Argentina, Brazil, Britain and Chile, though not exactly as they appeared in our reality.<br/><br/>Each of these fleets has undergone the expansion and reconstruction allowed by strong economic growth and relative political stability - without a German economic collapse to fuel it, the Great Depression is no more than a world-wide recession. Political and especially economic ties have aligned the Latin powers with their European partners: Argentina with Italy, Chile with Britain, and Brazil with the Central Powers of Imperial Germany and Austria-Hungary.<br/><br/>Tropic of Capricorn tells the story of the Second Great War in South American waters in our popular story-arc format: there are 24 scenarios, tied together with a narrative of the wider events they represent. The Second Great War setting was designed to maximize battleship action, and Tropic of Capricorn delivers.<br/><br/>Tropic of Capricorn is one of the first two new games to includes the Second Edition rules for Second World War at Sea: they&rsquo;re even easier to play with, with more options plus full-color play aids.<br/><br/>",

You keep on passing until either you can capture again or both players have to pass. <br/>The game is won by whoever has the most pawns left on the board or, in case of a tie, by the second player.<br/><br/>The rules suggest to score one point per remaining pawn followed by the switching of the first player.<br/><br/>",

        "description": "Deep within the heart of the planet Insectivus, the Bee Clan and the Wasp Clan battle for supremacy. Both sides pit their fiercest warriors against one another in the hope of weakening or taking control of their enemy&rsquo;s hive. Every hive that falls brings the war one step closer to ending.... Side with the honorable Bees wielding weapons of polished gold or align with the villainous Wasps, feral warriors of the badlands. But whatever you do...Protect the Queen!<br/><br/>Hive Smashers is a two-player card game using hexagonal cards to wage war. Each opponent creates a hive by circling his or her queen with strong warriors.<br/><br/>Once that's complete, each player takes turns laying a card down and then picking one up from the reserve pile. Laying a card down means covering an opponent's card on either hive. This is done with higher numbered cards. If a player lays down a card that strengthens their hive or weakens their opponents, then they are allowed to pick up an &quot;Action&quot; card. Action cards help players build tunnels or smash tunnels. If a tunnel is created to their opponent's queen (in the center) then a smash card can be placed on the queen to win.<br/><br/>But watch out, your opponent can do the same thing. On your turn, you must decide whether to strengthen the numbers in your hive, or attack your opponent.<br/><br/>",

        "description": "1973 was possibly the nearest that the world came to World War Three. Just following the U.S. withdrawal from Vietnam, and during the height of the Watergate scandal, the Americans were both war weary and disillusioned. The stock market crash of that year only made the situation worse, and when the Yom Kippur War erupted in October, the Israelis began to prepare thirteen of their nuclear weapons to halt the invading Arab armies! In response, the Soviet Union threatened to intervene, thereby causing the United States to alert its forces worldwide to prepare for a war against Russia. Such a war would have occurred when the United States was the most vulnerable and divided, but, ironically, the Americans would have had a vast reservoir of combat veterans from the Vietnam War to commit to action.<br/><br/>The Dangerous Year: 1973 uses a standard area movement system but includes a deck of 54 event cards that add a chaotic element to the game, such as &quot;Denmark Withdraws from NATO&quot; which prevents units from entering the Denmark space that turn, or &quot;Hotline&quot; which allows a player to prevent his opponent from conducting tactical nuclear attacks for the current game turn, and so forth. Event cards represent the various occurrences that could happen in the midst of a sudden war, and they ensure that this game gives the feeling of World War III. One moment, a U.S. aircraft carrier may be sunk by a Soviet submarine, but the next moment, a Soviet ballistic missile may explode on the launch pad. The randomness of a shuffled deck each game ensures that no two games are the same, and there is no perfect strategy...only a sudden execrable war of the worst variety.<br/><br/>This game uses a very simple combat system that is designed to resolve combat quickly, and includes the full panoply of combat units, armor, mech, infantry, artillery, SAMs, ships, fighters, bombers, et cetera, and not to mention the inveterate threat of tactical nuclear weapons. One thing is for sure, if the players do not trigger Armageddon, casualties will nevertheless be high for both sides.<br/><br/>",

Compete against your friends, rivals, and enemies by navigating the city using 91 unique combinations of powers. Rescue the most civilians and prove that you are the greatest hero in the city! Welcome to City in Peril!<br/><br/>This is a two to four person, free-for-all tactical navigation game. It plays in about 30-60 minutes regardless of the number of players. Each player controls a hero, and the goal of the game is to rescue the most civilians. There are 100 civilians that spawn throughout the game at an increasing rate. Players repeatedly navigate their hero from their corner of the city to the opposite corner using abilities from a common power pool.<br/><br/>The board is a top-down view of a city. There is a 6 by 6 grid of street intersections that have one of five obstacles. Civilians appear at these intersections by dice rolls, but the heroes must use power cards to get to them. Each turn, a player chooses one of five pairs of power cards. After their turn is over, the abilities are discarded and replaced by a new pair of cards. Game-play continues until all the civilians are saved.<br/><br/>Each player has a unique starting corner of the board and must move forward towards the opposite corner. Although there is a common pool of powers available to all players, what is useful to one player might not be useful to another. Players who are too greedy to rescue a lot of civilians in a single turn, might find themselves poorly positioned for future turns.<br/><br/>&mdash;description from the publisher<br/><br/>",

Each year, the mega city of Gettown plays host to a gladiatorial arena match like no other... 'The Tournament'. Combatants with powerful abilities and high tech weaponry, fight to the death to win wealth, fame and, the ultimate position of Master of Gettown.<br/><br/>Masters of Gettown is the world's first 'full contact dice' battling game. To that end, each game sees all players throwing combat dice in to a three dimensional acrylic arena, trying to end with the highest combat score each turn to either deal damage or defend themselves. During the game, players are encouraged to throw their dice at their own or other player's dice in order to physically change their value as well as activate character or combat abilities via the custom 'ability' die.<br/><br/>With this new 'full contact dice' combat mechanic, interchangeable arena bases (covered in various effect areas to aim for and avoid), a plethora of different characters and futuristic weaponry to equip them with, no two games will ever be the same. Also, with the inclusion of both easy to learn 'beginner' rules as well as 'experienced' rules, players can quickly get to grips with the practice of throwing their dice at other dice and then move on to advanced aspects of the game like bidding hit points and equipment drafting.<br/><br/>&mdash;description from the publisher<br/><br/>",

        "description": "The battle of the Washita River in 1868 is one of the most confusing and misunderstood engagements in the history of the United States military.<br/><br/>George Armstrong Custer led the 7th Cavalry in a dawn attack on what he thought was a single tribal village. It was discovered that Custer had struck one of several Native American camps along the river; now the Gallant Seventh faced hundreds of Arapaho, Kiowa, and Cheyenne warriors. Custer barely avoided encirclement as the Indians moved forward in an attempt to defeat the soldiers and complete the disaster by seizing the regiment's supply column.<br/><br/>One-Minute Washita River is a microgame attempting to portray the battle with a small map and a limited number of counters. This game is a solitaire challenge. The entire battle can be completed in a minute or two.<br/><br/>The player represents the tribal leaders. Groups of Native American fighting men pour out of their villages to block the advance of the cavalry. Rules cover historical elements like the protection (or possible rescue) of tribal noncombatants, the importance of &quot;counting coup&quot; within the tribal military structure, and the danger of reckless action in the face of an unpredictable enemy. Victory is determined by the safety of the noncombatants, the losses suffered by the Indians, and the damage inflicted on Custer's regiment. The playing pieces for the 7th Cavalry represent units the size of a battalion or a company. The supply column is also depicted. The maneuvers of these army formations are controlled by the game system.<br/><br/>This is a companion title in the previously released One-Minute game series that included Waterloo, the Little Bighorn, and the 1967 campaign of Che Guevara in Bolivia. It is a free Print &amp; Play game with a single 8.5&quot; x 11&quot; map, charts, rules, and about two dozen playing pieces or markers.<br/><br/>",

        "description": "Blood Before Richmond is a series of games recreating some of the Seven Days Battles fought between George B. McClellan&rsquo;s Army of the Potomac and the Confederate Army of Northern Virginia, under its daring new commander, Robert E. Lee. McClellan squandered a numerical advantage by demonstrating what would become a characteristic knack for turning tactical victories into strategic failures. Lee&rsquo;s ambitious battle plans were hindered by subordinates who seemed incapable of carrying them out - chief among them, oddly, the usually exemplary Stonewall Jackson. If either side had  been up to snuff, the war might have been decided in Late June 1861. Tiny Battle Publishing is proud to present the conclusion to this series of quick-playing, medium-complexity games about these fascinating and overlooked battles of the American Civil War.<br/><br/>A modified 2d6 die roll determines which Confederate Divisions activate on a given turn. Divisions that didn&rsquo;t pull their weight historically are less likely to show up than those that did most of the fighting. It&rsquo;s a simple, clever, and elegant way to recreate the difficulties Lee had during the Seven Days, and it creates the frustrating and tantalizing possibility that Jackson could do something if he&rsquo;d only show up.<br/><br/>Flipping a counter over when you take a hit doesn&rsquo;t capture the feel of bloody infantry collisions or the horrifying impact of artillery fire. The unique &ldquo;stack of steps&rdquo; system uses Step Counters stacked beneath the ID Counter to account for brutal attrition and devastating wipe-outs<br/><br/>The fifth and final game in our series brings the last engagement of the Battles of the Seven Days to light, where having lost his chance to envelop the Army of the Potomac, Lee now faced an enemy firmly entrenched atop Malvern Hill.<br/><br/>Contents:<br/>A whopping 176 action-ready counters.<br/>One beautiful 11x17 inch map.<br/>One gritty 12-page full-color grognard-friendly rule book.<br/>Zippered plastic bag perfectly designed to store your steps.<br/>Six sided dice, cutlasses, and Springfields not included.<br/><br/>",

        "description": "Joker Go is a Go variant/expansion using a special deck of cards.  Each player has an identical deck of 27 cards which show a configuration of Go stones.  In the basic game players choose to either play a stone normally or randomly draw and play a Joker Go card.  When you play a Joker card, you place the stones shown on the card onto the board in a spot of your choosing.  In the advanced variant you either play a stone normally, draw three Joker Go cards or play a Joker Go card.<br/><br/>A Joker Go card can completely change the board state, making a lost group safe or killing an unkillable group.   The potential for multiple stones to suddenly appear on the board subverts player's conventional understanding of the game of Go.  It forces players to think about shapes in a new way.<br/><br/>The basic game adds a very random element where you are challenged to make do with a random Joker Go card as best you can.  They are powerful, but the shapes you need may not be the shapes you draw.<br/><br/>In the advanced variant you have some flexibility as you have a choice of cards you can play.  Having a hand of cards also gives you some strategic goals.  You can play in a way that will make your hand cards more valuable.  Your opponent has to worry that the &quot;odd&quot; moves you are making will set up a devastating Joker Go card down the line.<br/><br/>",

        "description": "Inside the Cup is a simulation of the sport of golf using PGA Tour players and courses.<br/><br/>The development of the game started as a spinoff of the old Avalon Hill Golf game and then blossomed into something all its own. The stats the PGA tour keeps are much more detailed than ever before allowing for players to really show their strengths and weaknesses on golfer cards. Golfers are rated for driving length and accuracy. The cards show the golfers&rsquo; ability to hit greens from all distances along with proximity to the hole. Scrambling shots from the sand or around the green are captured as well as putting ability for distance and keeping away from the 3 putt.<br/><br/>Courses are depicted in colorful segments showing the good and the bad places on each hole. As shots are hit they end up in quadrants on the course that show the next club that will need to be used. Stay in the fairway and your next shot should be easier and hold better on the green. Hitting out of the rough or worse can make the shot to the green harder and might not hold up like you like. You don&rsquo;t want to be too far off the green as those areas could spell danger, while around the green shows safer chip shots or bunkers to hit out of. Some greens even have adjustments that make them easier to hole out or some are more likely to bring out a 3 putt.<br/><br/>Gamers can just let the golfers&rsquo; golf or you can have some strategic decisions to make. Should I hit a little less club onto this narrow fairway? Go for it on this par 5? Should I go pin hunting or just play it safe to the middle of the green? Should I putt aggressively or just lag it up there and get off this green?<br/><br/>There are even ways to quick play the game. You can go hole by hole or finish a round with one roll of the dice. ITCG is a fairly fast playing game that can allow a gamer to take his favorite golfers out on some of his favorite courses without leaving his own table.<br/><br/>",

Share your experience, teach disastrous tricks to them &mdash; and don&rsquo;t forget to retreat before it gets too hot. As we always do.<br/><br/>Please submit three copies of your signed applications to the galactic cash register. The name of the lucky winner who is about to join the scuffle first will be announced separately!<br/><br/>Setup: Shuffle New Legend with the Domination deck. Deal one Run for Power! card to each player. Put the upper Legendary Villain card face-up. When a Villain draws New Legend card from the Domination deck, replace the Legendary Villain card with the next one.<br/><br/>Each Legendary Villain has a Salutation, Influence, and Superpower. Salutation comes into effect when the Legendary Villain enters the game. The Legendary Villain's Influence is in effect all the time while the respective Legendary Villain card is in play. Finally, each player may address the Legendary Villain for moral and physical support (activate his/her Superpower) by using Run for Power! card.<br/><br/>You may play Supervillain with League of Villains expansion as it is described in it's basic rules. Or... you may use it as an incredible source of new game modes!<br/><br/>League of Villains is the expansion bringing maximum variability to the game.

Our heroes have heard of the Tarasque, a giant aberration of nature. They almost ask themselves how she got there.<br/><br/>Another epic battle will be waiting for you in the cemetery of Castelray, where you will be facing a very particular kind of greenskin. Brawls between greenskins happen more often than one would think of, and this is not surprising because for orcs fighting is a rewarding experience.

You can collect most points if you have a card in your treasure chest, that no one else has, not even the Bank or if you collect many of the same type of cards, and the Bank also has many of them.<br/><br/>The game includes:<br/>5 types of treasure cards, each with 3 categories, slightly different from one another<br/>3 types of markers:<br/>Red marker: you have to throw out cards permanently<br/>Green marker: you give the card to the Bank<br/>Boat marker: you make the card part of your treasure chest<br/><br/>Game overview:<br/>In the beginning of the game the card pile is divided equally between the players. The first player turn their top card face up and put down without looking at it. As soon as the card is shown anyone can put one of their markers on the card. One card can only have one marker. The round is over when all the players showed the defined number of cards (for example 3 players show 4 cards per person in a round). Cards without markers are used again in the last round, the marked cards are placed according to their marking. The game is over when all the cards are played out.<br/><br/>Scoring:<br/>If you have a card that is not in the Bank, but more than one player has it, is worth 1 point per card. <br/>If you have a card that is also can be found in the Bank, the card will be worth as many points as the number of cards in the Bank.<br/>If you have a card that is not in the Bank, and only one player has it, is worth 10 points.<br/><br/>&mdash;description from the designer<br/><br/>",

Then the other players vote on whether the story made sense or not; if at least half say yes, you can just discard the cards, otherwise you have to draw to replace them.<br/><br/>The goal is to get rid of all your cards. However, the game continues until one team wins. The only catch is, nobody knows what team they're on until they run out of cards! Cards that tell you what team you're on are dealt at the start of the game but are kept face-down and unchecked until you run out of cards. This keeps voting honest even as the game goes on.<br/><br/>While the rules are in Japanese, the cards have no text, so the game can be played in any language.<br/><br/>-- user summary<br/><br/>",

Players take turns drawing cards and building their railroad connections.  Players' resources are limited by number of cards he may hold in his hand, but may be increased by building increasing levels of routes.  Route levels (size) are determined by the type of locomotive used for that route.  Stockpiling resources (cards) is tricky and dangerous because getting rid of unwanted cards is not trivial.  Players may also collect corporation cards which increase the value of the player's routes connected to that corporation's home city.  Holding corporation cards count against a player's hand limit; representing the built-in cost of that corporation card. Private company cards (representing privately held railroads) may be used to connect otherwise unconnected cities, but at a cost to the value of the route for which they are used.<br/><br/>&mdash;description from the publisher<br/><br/>",

The lungs of smokers are black. On the other hand, &quot;secondhand smoke&quot; is the smoke emitted by smokers that affects people in the area. It is also called &quot;passive smoking&quot;.<br/><br/>Basic Flow of Game <br/>Each player puts up to two cards from a hand of three to the table.<br/><br/>Only those with the largest number of cigarettes on the card will succeed in smoking.<br/><br/>At that time, the lung will become black as many as the number of lung markers on smoking cigarettes. If there is a secondhand smoke on that card, other players who fail to smoke will also receive a lung marker. Even though they were not able to smoke, the lungs slowly become black and bring everyone closer to death.<br/><br/>When only one person is still alive, the game ends and the player who smoked the most cigarettes will win.<br/><br/>",

Cards contain plant and animal species and the food, water, shelter, and space they need to survive. Much as with wildlife conservation in the real world, the games of What in the Wild focus on cooperation, collaboration, or side by side competition rather than head to head competition. Each game was designed with children and families in mind, and most have variants that let you ramp up the challenge as players get older and are looking for more strategic gameplay.<br/><br/>&bull;    Match It! A memory game where you explore the different types of habitat elements and which species use them.<br/>&bull;    Connect It! A cooperative game of map building to construct a resilient ecosystem before time runs out.<br/>&bull;    Slap It! A fast paced race to assemble habitat for as many species as you can.<br/>&bull;    Group It! A push your luck set collection game.<br/>&bull;    Build It! A collaborative game of habitat creation.<br/><br/>What in the Wild was designed to complement the Michigan Department of Natural Resources Wildlife Division&rsquo;s &ldquo;Go Wild for Michigan&rsquo;s Wildlife&rdquo; curriculum for kindergarten through 5th grade. A core element of the curriculum is introducing students to common wildlife species they may encounter and increasing their understanding and appreciation of these animals. This forms the heart of What in the Wild, and its games put their primary focus on fun, engagement, interaction, humor, and challenge. In a classroom setting, it&rsquo;s a tool for teachers to use to extend student understanding of course content. For a family, the emphasis is on providing fun games that the youngest and oldest members can enjoy together.<br/><br/>description from designer<br/><br/>",

There your white brothers will not trouble you; they will have no claim to the land, and you can live upon it, you and all your children, as long as the grass grows or the water runs, in peace and plenty. It will be yours for ever.<br/><br/>President Andrew Jackson<br/><br/>As Long as the Grass Grows is a card driven board game depicting the Conquest of the American West from the Texas Annexation of 1845 to the surrender of Sitting Bull in 1881. At the start of each turn a President card is drawn and resolved, to determine the policies of the new administration, foreign affairs, and gold rushes. The players draw Action cards, make agreements, and play their cards as Events or for Action Points so they can move, raid, and fight with troops of cavalry and infantry, or tribal warbands. The United States Player wins by protecting pioneer trails, upgrading them to railroads, civilising tribes, and seizing control of territories, particularly those with pioneers and gold. The Great Plains, Northwestern, and Southwestern Tribal Players win by resisting the westward advance of the United States, maintaining control their homelands, and avoiding the Reservation for as long as possible.<br/><br/>Includes<br/><br/><br/>     Scenarios for 1845-57, 1857-69 and 1869-81, which can be combined into campaign scenarios.<br/>     Two player alternate history game with no US player.<br/>     108 Event cards including Generals, Chiefs, Pioneers, Gold Rushes, and Epidemics.<br/>     10 President Cards representing every president from 1845 to 1881, reflecting the policy of their administration.<br/>     Buffalo, Gold, Massacre, Trail, Peace Chief, and War Chief markers.<br/>     California, Oregon, Mormon, Bozeman, Smoky Hill, Santa Fe, Old Spanish, and Goodnight-Loving Trails allow rapid movement across the continent, may be raided by local tribes, and upgraded to railroads.<br/>     Control of territories by the British, Mexicans, Mormons, Texans, CSA, USA, and Tribes.<br/>     Variable victory conditions, increasing for the US and decreasing for Tribal Factions as the game proceeds.<br/><br/><br/>&mdash;description from the designer<br/><br/>",

It is quick to play and easy to learn.  The goal is simple: work together to use all the cards in player's hands before running out of cards in the deck.<br/><br/>Every turn consists of three phases: Draw, Play, Pass.  Each player will have to choose how many cards to draw, which cards to play on the stacks, and which cards to pass to fellow players.  Roles limit what cards can be played so that players have to depend on each other.  Work together to keep yourself and your teammates from getting stuck with cards you cannot play.  If everyone gets stuck, you lose.  Play all the cards in your hands to win the game!<br/><br/>",

Round up a threesome for quickie play, or divide a larger group into two teams and play competitively dirty! Whichever mode you chose, the rules are as easy as the players. Before anyone starts diddling the dough, the selected sculptor chooses a Dirty Dough card. All cards have three categories (Sexy, Kinky, Disgusting) and hints. The sculptor reads their card&rsquo;s category and hint aloud, then flips the timer over. With 60 seconds on the clock, players compete to guess what obscene scene the sculptor is molding. The first one to collect three cards wins! If this isn&rsquo;t hard enough, use the challenge tiles to make team play even dirtier. Sculpt using only one hand, with your eyes closed, or use one of your teammates as a sexy mannequin!<br/><br/>",

The player with the Joker is the turncoat. Give five cards to each player.<br/><br/>THE MlSSlON: The game is played over a series of missions. On a player's turn they look at the top two cards of the deck and select one to determine the mission, placing the other card face-down in the discard pile. lf a player draws a picture card (known as a spy) it is immediately discarded and a new card is drawn. Then, each player takes a card and places it face down next to the mission. When all cards have been placed, add one face-down from the deck, shuffle the cards, and reveal them. Cards matching the suit of the mission add to the team's total; other cards subtract from it. The total must be equal or higher than the value on the mission card to succeed. If any spies were placed, the mission fails.<br/><br/>ACCUSING: At any stage a player can accuse another of being a turncoat. If they are right, the team wins. If not, the turncoat wins. If there was no turncoat, everybody loses. Otherwise, the game is won by the team if they succeed five missions, and won by the turncoat if the team loses five missions.<br/><br/><br/>From the designer: &quot;Werewolf (or as it is sometimes called, &quot;Mafia&quot;) was always a fantastic game for me, and one I played a lot in my early university years. It is a game of two teams, but of unknown identities. It is an interesting mix of old and new design concepts; the heated discussion and bluffing generated by Werewolf is very modem; whereas the player elimination and sitting around is becoming ever more rare with each new design. One immensely popular (but lengthy) board game involving traitors is Battlestar Galactica, by Corey Konieczka. It sets players on a spaceship, trying to collectively ward off dangers, which would be easier, were it not for the traitor in the midst. I have extracted the game's clever system of sabotage-by-card, and came up with Turncoat.&quot;<br/><br/>",

        "description": "BELLA CONTRA BARBAROS covers the period of Rome's wars with the barbarians from 100 BC to 100 AD; from the reforms of Marius to the Dacian War of Trajan.<br/><br/>Basically, there are two contrasting systems of organisation and tactics and command and control<br/>Firstly the Romans - who are regulated and disciplined - good order is important to their manoeuvre and success in battle. This is the Roman army's great strength.<br/>The barbarians on the other hand - their warbands and cavalry are less-controllable but faster and rather more fluid in their battlefield movements. The barbarians' main strengths are their impetuous attacks and surprise in ambushes.<br/><br/>Combat Resolution<br/>An adaption of my Grand Manoeuvre Napoleonic set, the combat rules are not dice-heavy; the modifiers that most game systems use (for flank attacks, disorder, and other tactical advantages) are significant points in determining the combat results and instead it is the dice rolls that modify the outcomes. Generally, the die roll itself plays a less of an important part in determining combat results; usually it only adds one point in the combat calculation unless the combat element has impetus and then two dice are used.<br/><br/>Stratagem Cards<br/>There are some interesting ancient period flavours in this optional rule.<br/>These cards will provide some challenges for players to deal with.<br/>The cards include many of the stratagems mentioned by Frontinus and Polyeanus. There are 34 tactical ploys and stratagems. The cards can be selected by players, or picked randomly in the game set up phase for use in deployment or for use during the game itself.<br/><br/>Inspirational Pre-Battle Speeches<br/>A chance to deliver a rousing address to the troops before battle to encourage them to fight well&hellip; perhaps their morale is shaky and needs to be boosted?<br/>Another optional rule which adds period flavour; a pre-battle speech may give the player's forces some combat or morale advantages.<br/><br/>Heroic Death Rules<br/>Added to the mix (and only if things are going badly for the player) is the possibility of a heroic death for both barbarians and Romans &ndash; the Roman version of this being called the &ldquo;devotio&rdquo;.<br/>We may reflect that Boudicca is better known than Gaius Seutonius Paulinus.<br/>Everyone knows the name of Spartacus, but only the rather more keen, historical wargamer would know who Marcus Licinius Crassus was, or of his ultimate fate.<br/>This option gives the Barbarian player (who must be a tribal king, or a commander in chief) a chance to &quot;win&quot; on his, or her own terms even though in fact their armies will be defeated and the cause of the rebellion is lost.<br/><br/>Scenario Booklet<br/>There are eight historical battle scenarios from Rome's wars and campaigns against the barbarians; each has an introduction, umpires notes, player briefings and victory conditions, terrain generation rules and army lists.<br/><br/>The eight battles in the booklet are:<br/>Vercellae 101 BC - Marius` great victory over the Cimbri.<br/>Mutina 72 BC - Spartacus defeats the Governor of Cisalpine Gaul.<br/>Histria 61 BC - Burebista defeats &quot;The Monster&quot;, Gaius Antonius.<br/>Sabis River 56 BC - Caesar verses three Belgian tribes.<br/>Arbalo 11 BC - Drusus ambushed by the Sicambri.<br/>Volcaean Marshes 7 AD - The Batos unite against the Romans.<br/>Mons Graupius 83 AD - Agricola marches against the Caledonians.<br/>The First Battle of Tapae 86 AD - Decebalus` Victory.<br/><br/>Historical and Points based Army Lists<br/>Extensive Army Lists for most of wars and campaigns with Barbarians in the period are provided hopefully these will produce historical and balanced armies. In addition, I have made points-based army lists for Romans and Barbarians.<br/><br/>Battlefield Terrain Generation Rule Booklet<br/>This booklet has specific terrain rules for each theatre of the major wars with the barbarians.<br/><br/>QRB`s<br/>You can play these rules with various scale figures. Three versions of a six-page Quick Reference Booklet are supplied for use with 30, 40 &amp; 60mm base widths - players are advised to use the closest one in size to their own particular basing.<br/><br/>Game Markers are supplied<br/>Game marker files for hits, order and formations are supplied - players only need to print, fold, cut and glue or laminate them. Also provided are cards to remind players about the inspirational pre-battle speech effects. And to assist players some simple orders cards that may be hand-held or placed on table.<br/><br/>Campaigns<br/>Victory conditions are suggested according to scenario or campaign conditions and there are also recommendations for dealing with post-battle pursuits, and fluctuating morale in campaigns.<br/><br/>The Rule Book<br/>111 pages, with 66 colour photos and images illustrating the rules, a glossary of game and historical terms and an index.<br/>Black and white copies of rules &amp; quick-reference booklets are provided.<br/><br/>-from publisher's website<br/><br/>",

        "description": "An impressive, minimalist approach to playing &ldquo;dice baseball&rdquo; (although this game uses a card-draw from a standard playing-card deck for its random-results generation). Designer Jeff Downey has managed to incorporate just about every nuance of table-top baseball into a few pages of very clear rules and only two charts. If you like to rush, this is potentially the quickest playing baseball game available.<br/><br/>Very general player-attributes are &ldquo;graded&rdquo; for overall skill (Batter, Eye, Power, Defense/Fielding, Speed) i.e. a batter&rsquo;s Power rating could be &ldquo;Star&rdquo;, &ldquo;Good&rdquo;, &ldquo;Average&rdquo;, or &ldquo;Poor&rdquo;. Likewise, a pitcher would be rated similarly for Control etc.<br/><br/>For each at-bat, a card is drawn. It is first checked against the pitcher-rating chart, and depending on the result, following cards may need to be drawn, i.e. the pitcher-result may indicate &ldquo;Batter&rdquo;. In this case, the batter has put the ball into play and so the batter chart is used when drawing the next card (using the <br/>batter&rsquo;s particular rating, of course.) The result might be a hit or possibly &ldquo;Eye&rdquo;, so then the batter&rsquo;s ability to wait for a good pitch is being called into question. We go to &ldquo;Eye&rdquo; chart and draw another card for the result etc.<br/><br/>Steal, bunt, hit and run, double plays, sac flys, errors, and fielding are all represented in this fascinating, fast and very successful &ldquo;micro-game&rdquo;.<br/><br/>It is easiest to use a fictional team and randomly generate the attribute-grades, but you can certainly use real stats and create a general guide for using historical players.<br/><br/>&mdash;user summary<br/><br/>",

In general they don't belong to any faction (resp. to any player) and can be played in different combinations with the basic game or with the BIG!Expansion. We don't recommend to mix more than 3 different types of NPCs in your games in order to avoid higher complexity. But you can mix them in totally different combinations, which ensures the long-term replayability and excitement in this game universe. Normally the NPCs have small complementary rules, which are provided only online on Battalia's home page battalia.eu as high resolution printable PDF files. The miniatures are distributed in small packaging boxes with custom artwork as separate items or possibly in bundles.<br/><br/><br/>",

        "description": "Tiny Tanks is a fast-paced, clever little shooter to get your game night started &ndash; you&rsquo;ll have a blast! Matches are fast - only a couple minutes each. And it's quick to reset! We recommend playing 4 or 5 matches in a sitting as warmup on game night!<br/><br/>Players control a tank moving across a field. There are three main actions: Move, Action Card, and Shoot. Each has their own straightforward rules to follow.<br/><br/>The goal is to strategically approach an opponent tank (which often involves putting yourself in danger) and destroying it! The simple mechanic makes for fast paced appetizer-style gameplay. The Action Cards blend simple instructions with humor and style.<br/><br/>&mdash;description from the designer<br/><br/>",

They live harmoniously with nature that provides them resources to live and survive. However, the peace is suddenly broken. Some parts of the forests are massively exploited by irresponsible people, leaving nature prone to destruction and lost of many resources.<br/><br/>In Orang Rimba: The Forest Keeper, players represent two members of the Orang Rimba tribe. Each turn, they spend action points to move around the forest gathering resources, complete a goal, deliver goods to barter for other goods, and chase away the illegal loggers who irresponsibly exploit the forest resources for their own benefit.<br/><br/>The game ends after twelve rounds or when one of the players has managed to complete all of their goals.<br/><br/>",

Steering the union into wealth and prosperity without bias or favoritism is not an easy task. That is why they picked you. That is why I picked you. Ensure that certain factions prosper more than the others, without being obvious, and I will make sure your political career is long and illustrious. If not, I can find someone else to assist me. ~Your Benefactor.&quot;<br/><br/>Your goal as a high council member is to have seven influence points by doing favors and spotting traitors. Most rounds, the active player moves a shared worker token to an empty trade deal space and players vote to raise both factions. Should be easy, but if your bias is discovered, you'll be exposed and censured. Better to play sub-optimally or spark a scandal or two. Be careful about moving up too quickly: you'll be watched more carefully and have extra administrative duties to distract you from your real work: doing the will of your benefactor.<br/><br/>&mdash;description from the publisher<br/><br/>",

The sort of individuals who call the infamous Belle Reve Prison home&mdash;super-villains.<br/><br/>Of course, no one will officially admit to any of this. That's the charm of Task Force X, perhaps better known by its nickname: the Suicide Squad. This team of super-villains, assembled by their director Amanda &ldquo;The Wall&rdquo; Waller, undertakes high-risk covert operations and in exchange receive commuted prison sentences. And we do mean high-risk. Regardless of abilities and talent, every member of the Squad is expendable&mdash;it&rsquo;s expected that many will not return. As expendable assets, all members are fitted with an explosive device in their neck to assure obedience. If Squad members try to escape while on a mission...well, escape isn't an option. Runaway and its BOOM!<br/><br/>Given the rigorous requirements of the job, the Suicide Squad lineup is always in flux. The roster has included Deadshot, a precise marksman and assassin; Harley Quinn, a peppy but psychotic villain; Captain Boomerang, the man who turns boomerangs into lethal weapons; Enchantress, a powerful sorceress who can wield magical energy; and their sometimes field leader Rick Flag, an elite soldier who is one of the only members who isn&rsquo;t a super-villain.<br/><br/>A group of super-villains who have a license to take drastic action in the name of serving a mission? There's no way that could end badly.<br/><br/>Bat-Boxes are the ultimate way to jump into the action of the Batman Miniature Game!

        "description": "Riddle us this: what cerebral criminal with an affinity for purple and green loves challenging the Dark Knight with cleverly calculated crimes and puzzling plots?<br/><br/>One of the Dark Knight's most infamous villains, Edward Nygma enjoys flaunting his intellectual superiority by conducting crimes and leaving clues for Batman to piece together. While this habit constantly leads to the aptly named Riddler failing in his criminal endeavours, his puzzle-problem actually stems not only from his own narcissism and ego, but also from a deep-seeded psychological compulsion. Because of this, the Riddler often finds himself a resident of Arkham Asylum following his inevitable capture.<br/><br/>Possessing a genius-level intellect, the Riddler creates elaborate, sometimes Rube Goldberg-esque traps, and is even willing to use innocent civilians as bait. Although not physically imposing, the Riddler's brilliance, neurosis and lack of empathy make him an incredibly dangerous foe. He cares very little&mdash;if at all&mdash;about the lives of those he uses in his plots and instead only sees them as disposable pawns in his continuing intellectual battle against Batman.<br/><br/>Bat-Boxes are the ultimate way to jump into the action of the Batman Miniature Game!

        "description": "Game Intro. &quot;Let&rsquo;s face it. You don&rsquo;t really want to be here. You don&rsquo;t really want to talk to any of these people. You don&rsquo;t really even want to play this game. But you came here for a reason, and you&rsquo;re not going to get it unless you&rsquo;re prepared to engage in a little small talk, the occasional social lubricant, and some generous nodding and smiling. If you play your cards right&mdash;literally in this case&mdash;you might just walk out of here a new person... yeah, who are we kidding, you&rsquo;ll just be happy if you get through the evening with your dignity intact.&quot;<br/><br/>Awkward Party is a thematic card game, with party game elements, that pokes fun at the bizarre traditions and anxieties that define awkward social gatherings. At the start of the game, each player receives a hand of seven Awkward Party cards (hand limit 7), three Why Am I Even Here? Cards (hand limit), and sets their individual Awkwardness meter to 5. The Party Interest meter is put in the middle of the table and also set to 5. The Awkward Party cards are the main cards that the players play throughout the game with varying effects. They come in a number of categories such as Conversation, Venue, Money, Role, Drink, Support, Romantic Encounter, Rejection, and Something Interesting. The Conversation cards also have their own subjects such as Weather, Movies, Sports, Religion, Politics, and Sex.<br/><br/>The Why Am I Even Here? cards are the secret objectives each player is trying to complete. They also vary considerably from having a Conversation with all other players to receiving Money from two other players to acquiring the &quot;Someone's Dog&quot; card. Once one of their objectives has been completed, the player must reveal the corresponding Why Am I Even Here? card. In most cases, the winner of the game is the player who has revealed the most Why Am I Even Here? cards. There are a few exceptions such as the &quot;Go Home&quot; and the &quot;Street Cred&quot; Why Am I Even Here? cards, which are only completed and revealed when a particular game-ending event is triggered, even if it is not on the player's turn. If the event is triggered, the player holding the corresponding Why Am I Even Here? card wins the game regardless of how many revealed Why Am I Even Here? cards other players have. The game ends immediately when any one of the following events occurs:<br/><br/>     A player reveals three completed Why Am I Even Here? cards. <br/>     A player's Awkwardness meter exceeds 10 (and they are forced to leave the party).<br/>     Party Interest drops below 1.<br/>     Party Interest exceeds 10 for the third time and the cops arrive to shut it down.<br/><br/><br/>Game-play itself is turn-based. Each player turn has four phases: <br/><br/>     Play 0-2 Awkward Party cards. <br/>     Discard any number of Awkward Party and/or unrevealed Why Am I Even Here? cards. <br/>     Draw Awkward Party and/or Why Am I Even Here? cards up to the hand limit (revealed Why Am I Even Here? cards still count).<br/>     Reduce Party Interest by 1.<br/><br/><br/>If a player plays a conversation card on another player, any player may play another card to join the conversation if their awkwardness is low enough and they have a matching subject. With the exception of Conversation, Rejection, Money, and Support cards, turns can be stolen by other players by playing a card in the same category as the card just played. This card counts as the first card played by the player that just stole the turn. Turn-stealing can be chained, one card at a time, so long as players continue playing cards from the same category.<br/><br/>&mdash;description from the designer<br/><br/>",

        "description": "The game contains two variants: 1. Liberation Game, 2. Happy Families (a quartet game). The first variant involves the following:<br/>It is an exciting game for 2 players. The cards are dealt as follows: one player uses the carts with the red backs and the other player the cards with the blue backs. Each player thus receives 26 cards. Each player arranges the cards in 4 rows of 6 cards and below this a fifth row consisting of 2 special cards (the &quot;Magic Potion&quot; and the &quot;Normans&quot;). All cards are placed face down. The aim of the game is to keep Britannia out of Roman Hands and find the magic potion as fast as possible!<br/><br/>Throw the die and turn over a card from your opponent's first row. If this card matches the symbol on the die, you can remove this card to clear a path to the magic potion. If the symbol and card do not match, turn the card face down again. Play now passes to your opponent. You can place &quot;steps&quot; horizontally, vertically and diagonally. You and your opponent take turns to roll the die and, if you get lucky, remove a card. But watch out for the &quot;Julius Caesar&quot; Cards!<br/><br/>",

The Monarch challenges whichever other player they want, then spits a few lines of their best 1980s wrestling promo impersonation. Take turns back and forth until one of you loses your furious concentration. When someone cracks, the other player is now Monarch of the Mat and challenges any other player. Keep playing until everyone taps out. The final Monarch wins the title belt.<br/><br/>The game comes printed on a bandanna.<br/><br/>",

It's the follow-up to Tixel and Regatta.<br/><br/>The rules of Poka Yoke are exactly like the Tixel rules (see below) with the addition of the following 'piece promotion' rule:<br/><br/>If in a single turn a player picks up 1 of her own pieces (during a bonus move) to end the turn, then the picked up piece is promoted to a Regatta piece. In any single game at most 2 pieces per player can be promoted in this fashion.<br/><br/>Brief description of the Tixel rules:<br/>On a turn, a player can either place a new Tixel piece or move one of her own Tixel pieces already on the board. A Tixel piece can be &quot;active&quot; or &quot;inactive&quot;; only active pieces, which are at a 45&ordm; angle, may be moved. Making pieces inactive is done by moving next to or passing an active piece.<br/>Chaining moves is important as this temporarily unlocks three additional move types (aside from placing or moving a piece). If a piece that is moved is made inactive at its end position &mdash; i.e., it's sacrificed &mdash; a player can take an extra move if she so chooses; aside from placing or moving a piece, she can now remove a piece from the board, activate an inactive piece, or pivot an active piece to reorient its hollow side.<br/><br/>",

Play your cards right, build a rocket, and head to the Moon!<br/><br/>To the Moon is played over several rounds. Each round is made of several countdowns, or tricks. The goal of each trick is to be the last player still &ldquo;in,&rdquo; and this earns you one point for every card in the trick.<br/><br/>To start the round, shuffle the deck and deal a hand of cards to each player. The number of cards you deal out varies with the number of players, as follows:<br/><br/>Players: 2 3 4 5 6<br/>Cards: 8 7 6 5 4<br/><br/>The dealer plays the top card of the deck to start the first trick. Each trick represents a countdown, and may therefore contain no more than one card of each rank. Play proceeds clockwise, skipping players who are out. On each turn, you may do one of three things: build, test, or withdraw<br/><br/>Build: Play a card from your hand into the countdown. This card can&rsquo;t match any of the cards that are already there. If you complete a perfect countdown (all ten cards), then you win this trick immediately. Otherwise, play continues, and you are still in.<br/><br/>Test: Play the top card of the deck. If it is a legal play, then your test is a success, and you are still in the trick. If it matches another card, then you are knocked out of the trick, and take that card into your hand.<br/><br/>Withdraw: Play no cards, and take yourself out of the trick. You also take one card from the table into your hand, unless this would leave no cards on the table.<br/><br/>Note: When out of the trick, lay your hand face down on the table, with the card that you just took face up on top. This makes it easier for everyone to see who is in and out.<br/><br/>Taking the Trick: When only one player remains in the trick, that player wins the trick and scores those cards. All players come back in, and the winner leads the next trick by playing the top card of the deck. If the deck is empty at this step, the round is over.<br/><br/>Scoring: Each card captured in a trick is worth one point. Play six rounds, and then the highest total score wins.<br/><br/>",

They throw all the ingredients into a bowl, and when a sandwich forms, they grab it.<br/><br/>You Need: A Pairs deck and a way to keep score.<br/><br/>Note: This game can be played cutthroat (with everyone playing alone), but with more than three players we prefer playing in teams. See Team Play with Odd Numbers below to learn how to do this with five or seven players.<br/><br/>Structure: Lunch Rush is played in several rounds. In each round, players take turns playing cards into the center and trying to complete &ldquo;sandwiches.&rdquo;<br/><br/>A sandwich is a sequence of cards in which one or more smaller cards lie between two matching larger cards. For example, 9-8-3-9 is a &ldquo;nine sandwich,&rdquo; made from two 9&rsquo;s surrounding an 8 and 3. However, 9-8-10-9 is not a nine sandwich, because the 10 is larger than the 9&rsquo;s. Playing a 10 into the second sequence would create a ten sandwich: 9-8-10-9-10.<br/><br/>Note: Two matching cards in a row does not make a sandwich, because there must be at least one smaller card between them.<br/><br/>To Begin the Round: Shuffle the deck and deal a hand of cards to each player. The number of cards in hand, and the total number of rounds to play, is as follows:<br/><br/>Players:   2 3 4 5 6 7<br/>Cards: 10 9 8 7 7 7<br/>Rounds: 6 6 4 5 6 7<br/><br/>Sequence of Play: Starting on the dealer&rsquo;s left, each player in turn plays one card from their hand into the sequence in the middle of the table. If you complete a sandwich, you pick up those cards and score them.<br/><br/>Scoring: For the &ldquo;bread,&rdquo; the large cards that bracket the sandwich, you score one point per card. For the &ldquo;meat,&rdquo; the smaller cards inside the bread, you score face value. For example, a sandwich of 7-4-7 would be<br/>worth a total of 6 points: 4 for the meat, and 1+1 for the bread. Keep these cards aside, with the bread face down and the meat face up.<br/><br/>Play continues until all players&rsquo; hands are empty. Record your scores for the round and pass the deal to the left.<br/>The total number of rounds in the game is given above.<br/><br/>Team Play with Odd Numbers?<br/><br/>With five or seven players, you can use a format of rotating teams. The dealer plays alone, and the other players divide into two teams. With five players, the teams are A-B-A-B-D, where D is the dealer. With seven, they are A-B-A-B-A-B-D. In a full game, each player deals once.<br/><br/>Because these teams are temporary, each player keeps a separate score. Both of the players on a team score all of that team&rsquo;s points.<br/><br/>",

ITT challenges players to move and fight with company-level formations made of separate platoon-sized units during five minute, impulse-based turns. The historically accurate maps are scaled to 100 yards per hex. This approach recreates WWI command and control problems and inspires historically accurate play without forcing decisions.<br/><br/>Devil Dogs 2 Faith &amp; Sacrifice is an expansion/battle pack for Tiny Battle's In the Trenches: Devil Dogs. It adds counters for both the US Marines and German's, including tanks and four scenarios covering battles between them in the last year of the war, each with its own map.<br/><br/>The list of the 4 scenarios - which each include 1 to 3 alternate scenarios:<br/><br/>1. The Farm: &quot;As the troops in field-gray uniforms emerged from the woods and began their assault across the field, prone Marines spread out across a small ridge made sight adjustments and windage estimations. The Marines of the 2nd Battalion, 5th Marine Regiment, lying in the grass at Les Mares farm, readied their Model 1903 Springfield rifles and laid out five-round stripper clips of .30-06 ammunition beside them for easy access.&quot;<br/><br/>2. Advance on Vierzy: &quot;On 17 July 1918, the Marines and other Allied units marched through rain and mud near Soissons. Early on the morning of 18 July the 5th Marine Regiment began a major offensive by sweeping the Germans from Translon and Verte Feuille Farms. The swift advance was halting only after the enemy managed to reinforce their defense line running south through Vierzy. After regrouping, the Marines were ordered to advance on Vierzy later that afternoon.&quot;<br/><br/>3. Carnage at Bouresches: &quot;After the costly gains in Belleau Woods and near Lucy, Marine forces turned their attention to clearing the Germans from Bouresches. The depleted 5th Marines, having sustained heavy losses in an open ground assault near Lucy approached Bouresches from the woods to the West. The 6th Marines had been ordered to aid the attack on Bouresches from its position near Triangle Farm.&quot;<br/><br/>4. Action at Blanc Mont: &quot;The first week of October saw heavy fighting and left both Marines and other allied units stuck well forward of supporting forces. Nicknamed 'The Box' by Marines since they were forced to defend against counterattacks from all sides. On the 7th and 8th of October Marines, with support from other units pushed into St. Etienne to take out the fortified MG positions and escape 'The Box'.&quot;<br/><br/>",

When you do, you may pick any Gravestone and peek at the back side, then place it back in the same spot.<br/><br/>If the Scare you play is the fifth Scare on the Gate, the four earlier Scares on the Gate are discarded (but the one you just played stays there).<br/><br/>When there has been a BOO and players who played correct invisible Scares are claiming their rewards, a player picking a reward has the third reward choice of pointing at a gravestone and revealing it. That player earns whatever is on the back side, multiplied by the number of Scares on the Gate. Then (even if nothing was won), all Scares on the Gate are discarded and the Gravestones are reshuffled.<br/><br/>",

In this game, players try to successfully fund as many projects as possible through a simple mechanic that recreates the rollercoaster experience of running crowdfunding campaigns.<br/><br/>Basically, you are creating a campaign for a project and are trying to make it as successful as possible, maximizing the two key factors of any crowdfunding campaign: the number of backers and the pledge that each backer is going to make.<br/><br/>At the setup of the game, players are given a starting hand of campaign cards, a draw pile is made with the remaining cards. A selection of audience cards are placed in the centre of the table for the players to see, which are flipped before the game starts so players have to try and remember where the best of these cards are.<br/><br/>Players take turns to draw a card from a central draw pile; there are five different suits of cards that players are trying to collect to generate enough money to meet their funding goal. The suits are: pledges, stretch goals, add-ons, videos and buzz! Each campaign card depending on its type will provide the player with either coins or backers, multiplying the number of each together gives the player their funding total.<br/><br/>Mixed with these campaign cards there are also special action cards that allow players to interact with other players and the game further to help them get the cards they need.<br/><br/>Once a player has collected a set of the required cards, they are able to launch their project, declaring this to the other players as everyone tries to grab an audience card from the centre of the table to help them meet their goal.<br/><br/>Once a player has successfully funded projects worth 40 coins, they are declared the winner.<br/><br/>&mdash;description from the publisher<br/><br/>",

The result of playing the game is an enhanced understanding of the basic financial tools commonly used in business. The participants make up a team of executives for a fictitious company (can also be played individually).<br/><br/>The flow of the game is that each player or team of players make up a company that lives through a year in business, one month at a time. They run into many opportunities and some of those opportunities become obstacles if they do not respond to them correctly. And, the team has to deal with annoying things that happen in business like paying bills and dealing with an employee that steals from you or spending money on something that was not anticipated. Each month, the team completes that months section on a P&amp;L, Balance Sheet and Statement of Cash flows.<br/><br/>During the process, players are interacting with our website, their team and other teams and all of these relationships have an effect on the outcome of the game. The team with the most profit at the end of the game (year) WINS!<br/><br/>To start the game, the players must divide into teams. Each team being made of 1-3+ players. Teams can be bigger for large groups but 3 is the ideal largest team size. The teams name their company and roll dice to determine which side of the game board to play on (franchise vs. non-franchise) and from there, the players reference the &quot;play now&quot; section of the website to capture their region info to note on the main game board before they begin the first turn.<br/><br/>Each turn equals a month in business. The game lasts for 12 months (1 year) but the first quarter (3 months) has already been completed so the teams actually begin in April using Jan-Mar as a template for how to proceed.<br/><br/>Each team begins by rolling a dice to determine if they pull a &quot;sales&quot; card or a &quot;company&quot; card. Sales cards tend to lead to better results but not always. Following the instructions on the sales card, the team proceeds with completing the income sheet for that month. They then use those results to complete the balance sheet and then the cash flow statement.<br/><br/>Finally, they check the economic health of the other teams in their community to see if they are growing or declining which effects their income for the following turn (month).<br/><br/>This cycle continues in and through December where the winner is determined based on their total earnings, cash at the bank and owners equity.<br/><br/>Despite all the financial terms the game is both realistic and fun to play for families or professionals.<br/><br/>&mdash;description from the publisher<br/><br/>",

The same player may not be chosen twice.<br/><br/>After the teams have been chosen it is time to play soccer. Each player has their own board where they put their player cards. Both players start with a ball on their goal keepper. The ball is moved by rolling a dice and players do so in turn. With 1-2 the ball goes backwards, 3 sideways and 4-6 forward. If the ball can't move back it stays where it is.<br/><br/>When a player gets the ball to attacking zone a kick occurs. The attacking player throws the dice again and adds the value to the kickers attack value. Defending player checks the defending value of the goalkeeper and the player of his who has the ball and counts them together. If the attacker has a bigger sum the kick is a goal, and if defending sum is bigger the game continues.<br/><br/>The game ends when an agreed number of goals is made.<br/><br/>This is basically a two player game, but can be plaid with multiple people as a tournament.<br/><br/>",

Each character has some defense points and an innate prevention measure.<br/><br/>The game consists in using the defense cards in order to stop the characters from losing their defense points due to the effects of the pathogen cards. Everyone plays at the same time, with no turns or player order. The pathogens are defeated through player cooperation. The game consists of 6 rounds. Each round includes the following phases: exposure (to pathogens); prevention and treatment; infection and contagion.

In the &quot;Open-Mode&quot; configuration of this simulation each Team has a wall-mounted 1:50k planning map and the Simulation is played out on a table-mounted 1:25k map, divided into 2x3' sectors (roughly 10ft. across and 12ft. between the Divisional commanders). Each side has 3 Div. Commanders; 3 Artillery Commanders, 2 Operational Leaders; an Overall Commander; and an Operational Aide (22 people in total). To run the run the &quot;Closed-Mode&quot; a total of 55+ people are required. In the &quot;Closed&quot; version the Commanders are in a separate room from the Simulation and have status updates conveyed by written notes of brief, one-way, phone messages. HO scale miniatures (Roco) are typically used in the &quot;Closed&quot; version, so that limited &quot;Aerial&quot; photos (or sketches) can be requested. Combat is resolved through Dice-Rolling in a fashion similar to most commercial wargames of the era.<br/><br/>This is obviously more than your typical war-game, but it is a streamlined version of actual military simulations used by the US Army in the 1970's.<br/><br/>&mdash;user summary<br/><br/>",

        "description": "I Can&rsquo;t Even! (aka ICE):<br/>Friends Split into 2-3 teams, with 2-6 players on each team.<br/>Teams compete in quirky 60-second challenges to win points. Team with the most points wins.<br/><br/>It's competitive, hysterical party game that gets you on your feet and off the couch. Point valued cards are laid on a table, teams have a player (the host) read point valued card aloud then complete the challenge in 60 sec.  Once the card is read; the timer starts. No time to think, just GO! The higher the point value the harder the challenge is to complete in 60 sec. With 200 unique cards in the box, challenges are never the same &amp; literally could be a-n-y-t-h-i-n-g.<br/><br/>Once all cards are played, teams compete in the showtime round, giving each team a chance to gamble all,none or a portion of their points.<br/>The anticipation, the excitement, the urgency of it all is something you have to experience yourself. It&rsquo;s up to you. Pick your card, complete the challenge, get the points. Do you have what it takes? Even if you think you can&rsquo;t, YOU CAN!<br/><br/>&mdash;description from the publisher<br/><br/>",
