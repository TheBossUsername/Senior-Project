The game comes with 24 word dice, a timer and a dice cup. The rules say the game can be played in a group or in partnerships, but it does recommend that when more than six play, they do so in partnerships.<br/><br/>Each player (or partnership) casts the dice and attempts to form complete sentences before the timer runs out. Words can be placed crossword-style, which means that a word could be used in a horizontal as well as vertical direction. The score is 1 point for every word that forms part of a sentence (words used in both vertical and horizontal sentences score 2 points). However, 1 point is deducted for each die that is not used.<br/><br/>",

If the answers match, the father scores a card worth 25 points and he advances his pawn the number of spaces indicated on the card. If the answers do not match, the child&rsquo;s pawn advances one space. The game continues with all players changing roles as questioner and responders. The winner is the player who scores 250 points.<br/><br/>Three of the spaces of the gameboard are marked &quot;toy store&quot;. A player gets a chance card whenever landing here. Should a player land on the space indicated by the card held, that player is declared the winner immediately.<br/><br/>The game can be played by one family with the participants playing as individuals, or as a contest between families.<br/><br/>",

The players take turns rolling the die and moving their pegs in any direction he chooses but only in one direction.  If a player lands on an un-planted flower bed and has a flower of the same color as the bed, he can plant his flower.  But if the bed is already planted or the player does not have a flower to match the bed, he may not plant a flower.  After a player moves, his turn is over.<br/><br/>The winner is the first play to plant all his flowers.<br/><br/>",

The four games are Roundtable Chess, Roundtable Checkers, Wordstack, and Checkers Roulette. The game includes 4 complete sets of chess men, 4 complete sets of checkers (15  per set), and four sets of letter tiles (45 per set) that are used for playing Wordstack and Checkers Roulette.<br/><br/><br/>     Roundtable Chess is extreme and exciting chess play for 2 or 4 players. Each player plays with a complete set of 16 chessmen. Chessmen move and make captures as done in the traditional two player chess game. Chessmen in Roundtable chess can also be move in circular directions. Each player&rsquo;s objective is to gain control of the center of the Roundtable by safely moving his/her king into that position without it being checked or captured. The first king to control the center of the Roundtable wins.<br/>     Roundtable Checkers gives traditional checkers and extreme twist of excitement and face lift. It's designed for 2 or 4 players. Each starts with 15 checkers and can choose thousands of ways to set them up.  Players can also move up to four different checkers per turn in a circular, diagonal, horizontal, or vertical direction. Like regular checkers, you make single or multiple jumps to capture the opponents' playing pieces. The player that captures the greatest number of enemy checkers wins.  <br/>     Wordstack is an exciting 3-dimensional word game that plays 2 or 4 players. Each player selects 15 lettered checkers from her set of 45 tiles ranging from A to Z. Players may move up to 10 different lettered checkers per turn in diagonal, vertical, horizontal, or circular patterns. The player's objective is to earn points by combining (joining) her checker(s) with an opponent's checker(s) in order to spell words. Words may be spelled forward or backward, and in a diagonal, vertical, horizontal, or circular direction. Players may also capture (jump) an opponent's checker(s) to form a stack of checkers. The stack of captured checkers becomes a &quot;Wordstack&quot; when it is combined (joined) with an opponent's piece(s) to form words. The player who earns the highest number of points wins.<br/>     Checkers Roulette is numbers fun for 2 or 4 players. Each player uses 15 numbered checkers that include the values 5, 10, 25, and 50.  Players may move up to 4 different checkers per turn in a circular, diagonal, horizontal, or vertical direction. You score points by capturing (jumping) an opponent's checker(s), and lose points when your checkers are captured. For example, if your checker with the value of &quot;5&quot; captures an opponent&rsquo;s checker with the value &quot;10&quot;, you earn 50 points (5 &times; 10 = 50), and the opponent loses 50 points. You also earn or lose points by setting up plays. The player that earns the greatest number of points wins.<br/><br/><br/>",

To start the game each player is dealt an equal number of the vehicle tiles and the crossroads is placed in the centre of the table. The players then take turns spinning the spinner, and must attempt to place one of their tiles on whichever of the roads is pointed to. Tiles placed must match either the color or type of the vehicle currently at the end of this road. The winner is the first player to get rid of all of their tiles. Some strategy is provided by one of the tiles being a police car which can be placed at any time and permanently blocks off the road it is player on.<br/><br/>",

How to get ahead when the primary method of gaining points is by improving other player's positions?<br/><br/>'Ohana Proa was developed publicly via a blog on BGDF.<br/><br/>\t\t\t\t<br/>\t\t\t\t<br/>\t\t\t\t\tIntroductionThe societies of the South Pacific were characterized by gift economies in which wealth and status were defined by what was given to others rather than personal accumulation. In Ohana Proa players will compete for prestige via gift-giving and thus improving the other player's positions.<br/><br/>During the course of the game players will explore and claim routes among the islands. The number of routes a player may explore and claim each turn is limited by the number of explorers the player has (maximum 2).<br/><br/>Players will also join markets among the islands by moving them along 'claimed routes and in doing so attempt to gather them into groups. A group of three, four or five markets (player choice) is &quot;satisfied&quot; and is removed from the game. The number of routes that a player may move a market over during a delivery is limited by the player's proas (boats, maximum 7).<br/><br/>By delivering markets through islands where they have network presence players will receive fish or shells. Fish and shells may be used to gain an additional explorer, to acquire more proas or kahunas, to bid for turn order, to claim explored routes and to make and enhance kula items. Kula items are gifts that may be given to other players in order to gain prestige (but give the recipient points).<br/><br/>Fish rot quickly and are lost if not spent quickly enough. Shells rot more slowly and kula items decay. Kula items can be enhanced with fish or shells to increase their value when given.<br/><br/>The game ends when all of one colour of market has been delivered, a player reaches 33 prestige or the players reach deadlock. The player(s) with the lowest prestige score are eliminated from the game and do not score. The remaining players receive additional points for their prestige scores. The highest score wins.<br/><br/>Ohana Proa supports 3 through 5 players, is particularly recommended for 4 players and plays in around 150 minutes.<br/><br/>",

The game uses traditional Aboriginal style artwork to depict the many native animals to the Australian Outback.<br/><br/>Most of the spaces that can be landed on feature one of these animals and each animal has a different power. These powers affect anyone who lands on the space and often a series of powers can be triggered in the one turn as a player's piece is sent in multiple directions.<br/><br/>The game includes shortcut options, return to start spaces and the chance to catch up to the leader.<br/><br/>This game is really suited to Ages 5 - 10<br/><br/>",

        "description": "An educational game focussing on multiplication (up to 10 x 10).<br/><br/>The game's main components are 30 &quot;multiplication dice&quot;- dice that have a multiplication problem printed on three sides, and the results on the opposite sides.<br/><br/>The rules sheet suggests three different variants that can be played:<br/><br/>1) &quot;The stacking multiplication adventure&quot;<br/>The aim of this game variant is to build an obelisk as high as possible.<br/>Players take turns throwing two randomly chosen dice. If one die shows a multiplication problem, the player has to solve it. If both dice show a multiplication problem, the player can choose which one to solve. If both dice show a number instead of a multiplication, the player repeats the throw. If the player correctly solves the problem (the other players can check on the opposite side of the die), he/she passes the die on to the next player, who uses it to start building an &quot;obelisk&quot; (by stacking one die onto the next). If the active player cannot solve the multiplication, he/she has to start building the obelisk. Then it is the next player's turn. Each turn, another die is added to the obelisk, either by the following player (if the active player correctly solves the problem), or by the active player (if their answer is incorrect). <br/>The game ends when the obelisk collapses. The last player who managed to stack a die onto the obelisk without collapsing it wins the game. If the players manage to stack all dice before the obelisk collapses, they all win together.<br/><br/>2) The multiplication pyramid<br/>The aim of this variant is to be the first to complete a pyramid.<br/>The dice are evenly distributed among all the players. Players take turns throwing two of their dice. If one die shows a multiplication problem, the player has to solve it. If both dice show a multiplication problem, the player can choose which one to solve. If both dice show a number instead of a multiplication or if the active player can't solve the multiplication, they lose their turn. If they correctly solve the problem, they use the die to start building a pyramid (by stacking dice). Then it is the next player's turn. <br/>The first player to have used up all their dice in buidling their pyramid wins the game.<br/><br/>3) Speed multiplication<br/>The aim of the game is to find the fitting multiplication problem and grab the correct die.<br/>The first player chooses four dice and puts them on the table with a multiplication problem facing up. He/she then has a look at the results (without the other players looking) and puts them back. They then say one of the results, and all the other players try to grab the die with the multiplication that fits this result. The player who grabs the correct die earns this die. Then the next player chooses four dice. <br/>The game ends when all dice have been claimed. The player with the most dice wins the game.<br/><br/>",

The best way to view IAGO Chess is a system used to manage the wide range of interests on the part of people who like to play, and an approach to acclimate new players to the system.<br/>Because of this, you won't find one set of codified rules, as you would with other chess games. The IAGO Chess system accomplishes its objectives by the use of multiple versions (classes) of the game that represent the fullness of the chess experience. These versions build upon one another,<br/>to allow a person to get fully familiar with the game. There are six versions (classes) of the game. These versions are: A-Class, B-Class, C-Class, M-Class, V-Class, and X-Class.<br/><br/>This version of chess is more than just a chess variant, it is a system by which chess can integrate variants and evolve.  It has multiple layers and is robust enough to change over time.  Its mission is to be a forever evolving version of chess that will provide a migration path for changes.<br/><br/>It is also meant as a framework for playing all versions of chess relating to the International Abstract Games Organization.<br/><br/>For the actual rules, check out the Chess Variants website:<br/><a target='_blank' href=\"http://www.chessvariants.org/index/msdisplay.php?itemid=MSiagochesssyste\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer noopener\">http://www.chessvariants.org/index/msdisplay.php?itemid=MSia...</a><br/><br/>",

One set of cards has a simple equation, like &quot;2 + 1&quot; or &quot;9 -7&quot;. Another set has solutions, like &quot;=3&quot;.<br/><br/>The cards have two special features. First, on one side graphics are shown with the numbers, while on the reverse the graphics are not shown. This allows the games to played at different levels based on the age of the children. Second, each card has a hole in it, and the placement of this hole aligns with its solution cards so that when the proper answers are placed together, a wooden &quot;king of numbers&quot; figure fits precisely into the combined hole; if the king doesn't fit, the answer is wrong. The wooden King piece doubles as a pencil holder, which is helpful since some of the games require scorekeeping on a piece of paper.<br/><br/>Using this card set, the rules describe seven different games of increasing difficulty. One of these is a solitaire game, the others are for 2, 3, or more players. Each is interesting and the variability of the play with the unique cards keeps the game interesting through multiple plays and useful for children.<br/><br/>",

        "description": "Ever since the mock Iranian attack with four Fast Attack Craft upon USN ships sailing though the Straits of Hormuz in January 2008, the USN had been on alert. While American intelligence, in theory, could predict the technological level of the Iranian weaponry, and their own wargames showed USN vulnerabilities, there was always the chance element. The USN had always been on a heightened alert when traversing the Straits, especially when they knew the Iranians had at least 70 anti-ship missiles within range. Not to mention their capability of launching ASMs from aircraft platforms. Not to mention, their Chinese FACs with ASMs. The threat had always been real. The USN continued to have confidence, perhaps wrongly, that their superiority in higher technology could and would keep their ships out of harm&rsquo;s way.Iran had decided to attack using &ldquo;swarm&rdquo; tactics. The USN had itself used such tactics in their own wargames with devastating results. It was found out that using swarm tactics greatly increased the likelihood of Iranian success, even when only Fast Attack Craft were used. That was then. Now, apply the same tactics with ASMs and the scenario was even more horrific. The USN would not make a preemptive strike, that would be political suicide on the world stage. Iraq was still combative as ever. All the USN could do was remain vigilant at all times while moving through the Straits and into the Persian Gulf. If Iran attacked, they would have to make it count as America&rsquo;s response would literally demolish the Iranian forces in and around the Straits.<br/><br/>Contains:<br/>- 2 11&quot; x 17&quot; maps sheet depicting the battle area.<br/>- One set of 280 die cut &frac12;&quot; playing pieces representing ground combat units.<br/>- One rulebook<br/>- 4 sheets of Charts and tables<br/><br/>",

Production number 15504.<br/><br/>The box cover shows a drawing and signature of Ole Olsen, the Danish world champion in speedway.<br/><br/>The game has borrowed the player pieces from the Swedish Tippa Speedway, but the actual gameplay and board is very different.<br/><br/>The board has depicted a 4 lane track in an oval form (as is the case in speedway) which are again divided into squares. Some of the squares are coloured in one of 6 colours - and the colours determine what happens if you land on them. One game lasts for 4 rounds, as in real speedway, but there are additional/optional rules for both team and league play.<br/><br/>The rulebook actually suggests that since the game &quot;aims at following the real speedway rules as close as possible&quot;, the ideal number of players is 16(!) which seems like a huge number for an old-fashioned roll-and-move game like this.<br/><br/>Also, the rules in various languages are all signed by Ole Olsen, giving the impression that he actually designed the whole game(?).<br/><br/>",

From Mancala World:<br/><br/><a target='_blank' href=\"http://mancala.wikia.com/wiki/Daramutu\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer noopener\">http://mancala.wikia.com/wiki/Daramutu</a><br/><br/>Daramutu is a mancala game, which is played by village women in Sri Lanka with astonishing rapidity. The game was first described by Henry Parker in 1909. He notes about them:<br/><br/>&quot;Without counting the seeds (...) they seem to know instinctively, perhaps as the result of long practice, at which hole it is best to begin in order to effect captures. An inexperienced person has no chance of beating them.&quot;<br/><br/>Rules:<br/><br/>The board called olinda-poruwa has 14 holes (wala) arranged in two rows (pila). Between them are two rectangular hollows serving as stores for the captures.<br/><br/>Initially there are four seeds (indiya, pl. indi) in each hole, usually from the Olinda creeper (Abrus precatorius).<br/><br/>On his turn a player sows (ihinawa) the contents of one of his holes, one at a time, into the succeeding holes. The direction of play (clockwise or anti-clockwise) is decided by the first player and then adhered to throughout the game by both players.<br/><br/>When the last seed falls into an occupied hole, which contained three or more seeds, its contents (including the last dropped seed) are sown in another lap.<br/><br/>A singleton is called puta (&quot;son&quot;), a hole containing two seeds naga (&quot;daughter&quot;).<br/><br/>If the last seed falls into an empty hole, a puta or a naga on either side of the board, the contents of the opposite hole are &quot;eaten&quot; (innawa). The captures are collected in the store.<br/><br/>If the opposite hole is empty, nothing is captured.<br/><br/>A turn always ends by dropping the last seed in hand into an empty hole, a puta or a naga.<br/><br/>The game is finished when a player has nothing to move with at the start of his turn. The remaining seeds that are not yet captured are won by the player who could move last.<br/><br/>The game is won by the player who captured more seeds.<br/><br/>",

Later the Scottish traveller John Galt observed Mandoli on the Greek island of Hydra in 1810.<br/><br/>The game appears to be influenced by other mancala games played in the Osman Empire, such as Halusa and Mangala.<br/><br/>\t\t\t\t<br/>\t\t\t\t<br/>\t\t\t\t\tRulesJohn Galt reported in 1810 the following rules:<br/><br/>&quot;There is, however, a tolerably decent coffee-house; and in winter, even at present, card and chess players may be always found in it. I saw there to-day a game, which, not having seen elsewhere, I give you a description of. The Idriots call it Mandoli, or the almonds, and it is played at a board by two persons. Twelve hollows are scooped in the board, in two rows of six each: in each hollow six balls are placed, and the opponents take each a row. The game is commenced by the first player taking out the balls from any one of the hollows, and distributing them, one by one, successively, round the board. In the first round no balls can be captured, but in the second the contest becomes serious. The skill of the player consists in so managing his distribution, that his last all shall either fall in a hollow where there is only one, or three, or seven, or nine &amp;c. which, by the addition of his ball, are made even numbers, and in consequence become prizes. If in the distribution he makes even numbers in the two last hollows, he takes the contents of both. This is considered a great stroke. The victor is, of course, he who reckons the greatest number of prisoners.&quot;<br/><br/>",

The Ijaw are with over 8 million people the fourth largest ethnic group of the country. Their armed militants, which form the Movement for the Emancipation of the Niger Delta, are fighting against the destruction of the natural environment of the Niger delta by the petroleum industry.<br/><br/>The game was first observed in the January of 1946 by K. C. Murray, the son of the famous English game historian Harold James Ruthven Murray (1868-1955). In Germany, Obridjie was mentioned in a game book in 1980. It was misspelled Obridjic in the description, while it was written correctly in the index of contents. Since then, the wrong spelling has been copied many times.<br/><br/>Obridjie is very similar to other Nigerian mancala games, such as Whyo (Oron clan, Ibibio), Jerin (Yoruba) and Lok (Jaba). It is a simple game which is preferred by women. A similar game is known by the Anuak at the Ethiopian-Sudanese border as Anywoli.<br/><br/>Rules:<br/><br/>&quot;The game board consists of 2x6 smaller holes and a store hole at each end. Initially there are four seeds in each of the smaller holes. A player owns the row closest to him and the store to his right.<br/><br/>At his turn a player takes the contents of one of his smaller holes and distributes it, one by one, counterclockwise into the following holes, but not in the stores. If the last seed falls into a non-empty hole, its contents including the last distributed seed is continued to be distributed.<br/><br/>If at any time during a turn a hole contains four seeds, its contents are captured by the player who owns this hole. The captured stones are immediately put into the player's store.<br/><br/>Exception: If the last seed of a lap makes a four, these seeds are captured by the player who was moving, no matter where the hole is.<br/><br/>A move ends when the last seed is dropped into an empty hole or makes a four.<br/><br/>The game ends when one of the players can't move.<br/><br/>The game is won by the player who captured most seeds. The seeds which are still in the smaller holes are not counted.&quot;<br/><br/>",

As long as you carefully follow the rules for the movement of the pieces, you will be O.K., but the geometry of a concave surface can make things confusing.<br/><br/>Two lines can intersect in more than one point.  That means that a queen has two different ways to get from point A to point B.  A bishop can change colors and you can even end up with two bishops on the same color.  A rook in the center of the board controls two adjacent rows.  If a knight is near the center, it can land on the same color as the square it left.<br/><br/>You can win by either checkmating an opponent or by taking enough pieces of value from your opponents before being checkmated.  Thus, aggressive play is often rewarded.  There is a small score board with wooden discs to keep track of points earned (better pieces are worth more points).<br/><br/>",

San Francisco's large chinese community had dozens of Fan Tan Houses in the 19th century.

Published in Japan and written in Japanese, the game involves area movement of tanks in the later days of the Second World War.<br/><br/>The game includes 8 unpainted PVC tanks: two Panzer IV J, two Tiger I, two T-34/85, and two M4A1/76 Sherman.  However, as this is insufficient for most games, six sheets of cardboard counters are included with tanks and armored vehicles for Germany, America, Britain and the Soviet Union.  The cardboard chits represent a wide variety of armor including some less common units such as the American M26 Pershing and German Maus.<br/><br/>Units have several characteristics, including attack strength, defense strength, movement allowance, anti-personnel strength and point value.  The single, double-sided map included in the game depicts Berlin on one side and Bastogne on the other.<br/><br/>The game is not highly complex.  It is more a mechanism for players to use their World Tank Museum figures in a game.  It lacks several elements which were heavily involved in these and other armored engagements in this phase of the war, including infantry, anti-tank guns, artillery, and air power.<br/><br/>",

Two players portray destitute archaeologists burying their own items, trying to scam their way out of debt through duplicitous dealings with the museum's chief inspector.  First, the players seed the ruins of Stonehenge with their worthless junk, then they take turns calling the inspector to dig sites, artificially valuing their own artifacts, while rightfully debunking their opponent's.  Your &quot;finds&quot; grant you points, and everything of yours that the inspector approves is just another thing that can go back into the ground to be dug up tomorrow!  That worthless junk your opponent shoved into the ground gets tossed into a trash heap, never to be profited from again.<br/><br/>",

A fisherman can move forward or back according to a die roll, but never to a building that is more than one rank better than the one that his wife is currently in. Moving the wife forward can only be achieved by a kind of lottery, in which you draw wooden sticks from a bag. The more green ones, the better the result. If you fail to reach the number of green sticks determined by the square you are on, both the fisherman and his wife move back to their lowly hut and start again. <br/>There is a &quot;magic fish&quot; which determines the end of the game. It consists of three jigsaw puzzle pieces, and any player who rolls a fish symbol can either add one piece of the fish or move 1-4 squares (to extend the game).<br/><br/>",

        "description": "Death or Freedom is a game of gladiatorial combat in ancient Rome, from Steve Barber Models.<br/><br/>A bloodthirsty, fast playing game that recreates the carnage of the Roman amphitheatres. This game can be played by 2 or more Players and can either be played as one off single combats or as it is intended as Tournaments, where your Gladiator Characters battle for their lives, with heavily wounded victors being retired or succumbing to their wounds after the combat, and your victorious Gladiators battling to become champions and win you more money and infamy.<br/><br/>The basis of the game, is that you take on the role of a Lanista (proprietor of a Troop of Gladiators), with the sole aim of making as much money as you can out of the spilling of blood in the arena. Each Player starts with 1000 Denarii, (metal coins supplied with the game), this money is then used to buy the Gladiators that you start the first round with, and for placing side bets before each fight begins. Hopefully as you win your fights, you will increase your wealth, and be able to replenish your killed fighters with new ones, maybe even Essedarius chariots or Equites.<br/><br/>The game has a quick and brutal feel about it, with limbs being hacked off and savage Special Moves that can be used by your Champions. Many combats can be played in only 10 minutes, though more skilled Gladiators, or larger battles may take up to 1 hour. There are rules for Chariots, Horsemen, Wild Beasts, Unusual types of Gladiators as well as for the more common types, such as the Retiarius and the Veles and the Myrmillo.<br/><br/>The combats take place on a specially designed sandy coloured Arena Playing Area (supplied with the game). This is marked out with Hexes and a special mechanism for Chariot movements. The use of Hexes makes the movement and attacks on the flanks quick and easy to work out. The Arena Playing Area also has Number and Dropped Weapon markers, which can be helpful in larger battles when it can be hard to remember what order players fight in.<br/><br/>To sum up, I wanted this game to be fast and simple to play. This was difficult to do due to the numerous vastly different fighting methods, but I am very pleased with the results. The game bag contains all the things that you will need to play the game except the miniatures. The rule book has a ghostly sepia colour cover and has diagrams to help explain the harder rules. This game will bring out the tactician in you, as tactics play a vital part as the rounds progress. The more you play the faster it becomes and the more you will find that you have learnt since the last time you played it. So, if you fancy your chances in the sands of the colloseum, try it out!<br/><br/>&ndash;Description from publisher / designer<br/><br/>",

You'll find the fast food industry represented by McDonald's Corporation and high technology manufacturers represented by Texas Instruments.<br/><br/>Each of the companies available for investment not only represents itself but other similar companies as well. Therefore the Standard Oil Company (Indiana) also represents Shell, Mobil, Arco and the other large petroleum companies.<br/><br/>Each of the investments has a different sensitivity to the news flashes which come across the TV screen. For example - some investments will go up at a time of world crisis and others will go down. The inherent sensitivity of each investment to the various categories of news is graphically displayed on the gameboard.<br/><br/>Your ultimate objective is to anticipate investment fluctuations swiftly enough to take full advantage of the many buying and selling opportunities which will occur in a different way every time you play.<br/><br/>The rules of The Great Wall Street Fortune Hunt are designed to replicate real life as closely as possible. You can play it at four levels. It is highly recommended that you feel thoroughly comfortable at one level before incorporating the next level as part of the game. Have fun! Make money!!!<br/><br/>",

        "description": "\t\t\t\t<br/>\t\t\t\t<br/>\t\t\t\t\tBackgroundIt is the middle of the 19th Century, and China is about to descend into a period of chaos and rebellion.  Weakened by a decade of humiliation from foreign powers following the Opium War, the Qing Imperial Government is at odds with itself about how to rule the country.  One side argues that China should adopt Western practices and institutions in order to level the playing field abroad.  The opposition claims that China must continue to stand defiant of foreign influence and forge its own path.  At the same time, a failed Confucian scholar in a desolate region of the South has recently proclaimed himself a high place in a foreign religion--the younger brother of Jesus Christ.<br/><br/>So moved by his visions, he begins gathering followers to act against the government whose Confucian ideals had ranked him so poorly.  The pool he draws from consists not only of those who had been downtrodden and forgotten by the massive and corrupt governmental bureaucracy, but also wealthy families who believe a Han Chinese national could lead their people much better than the foreign Manchu from the North, who had conquered China almost two centuries before.<br/><br/>This prophet's name? Hong Xiuquan<br/><br/>His mission?  To expunge the Manchu demon rulers from the Han kingdom and usher in a new era of peace and prosperity on Earth.<br/><br/>The eventual death toll?  Over 20 million.<br/><br/>Welcome to the Heavenly Kingdom of Greater Peace--Taiping.<br/><br/>\t\t\t\t<br/>\t\t\t\t<br/>\t\t\t\t\tGame InformationThe Scramble for China is a two player war-game set in the most destructive period of the 19th century, the Taiping Rebellion.  You either play as the Taiping, a pseudo-Christian movement that is sweeping South and Central China and wishes to topple the Manchu-run government and create a new culture for China, or the Qing dynasty, an incompetent gigantic imperial administration that is trying to hold the country together and stop the momentum of the Taiping.<br/><br/>Players progress through the game using cards drawn into their hand; the cards either have an event written on them or a number of Action Points, and players take turns playing cards one at a time.  Action Points allow the players to recruit armies(colored blocks), form up troops into different types of units and attack the enemy.  During the course of the game both players can call upon foreign soldiers to get the edge in battle, and the Taiping will try and meet up with rebels in nearby provinces to add manpower into their army.  Victory goes to whichever side has the most victory points at the end of the game.  Most victory points are earned by holding red city spaces at the end of turn 8, but the Qing player gets bonus points for every city never lost, and the Taiping player for every rebel piece picked up.<br/><br/>A third Non-Playable faction exists in the game through 'The West'.  'The West' steals points from the Chinese players for every foreign unit on the board at the end of the game, randomly receives points for how much attention it is paying to China through 'The West' deck, and earns points from player card events and Chinese casualties.  It is very possible that both Chinese players will lose and the West triumphs, so Chinese players must be weary in how they utilize foreigners...<br/><br/>",

The player that wins the toss begins the game. To pass the ball the player has to play a card with the number equal or higher than the number on the white lines. If a player plays the ball to a white circle he/she can play another card. Otherwise there is a duel between the two players.<br/>Duel:<br/>Each player has four cards (if a player doesn't have four cards, complete the cards, till you have four) Then both player place a card on the table, face down. When both players have chosen a crad, turn around the cards. The player with the highest number on the card, has ball control. That player can pass the ball along the board.<br/><br/>To score points, the player plays the number (or a higher number) indicated on the board in front of the goal. To keep track of the points, a player receives a goal-chip each time a goal is made. If a player runs out of cards, the player with the most points wins the game.<br/><br/>",

        "description": "Katana To Yari is Japanese for &quot;Sword and Spear.&quot;<br/><br/>This is a detailed game of tactical combat designed to be played with miniature figures on a hex grid. Figures represent a single warrior or horse, with each warrior being rated for six characteristics.<br/><br/>Numerous weapons are described in the rules, including both melee and ranged weapons. Ranged combat covers firearms, archery, and makeshift missile weapons. Melee weapons have defined &quot;combat engagement zones&quot;, a spread of hexes in which the weapon can be used against an opponent. The defensive value of a weapon is also rated base on the relative hex from which an opponent's attack originates.<br/><br/>From the rulebook:<br/><br/>&quot;These rules, such as they are, are the results of around 20 years of messing around with 'samurai skirmishes' set in old Japan. The rules can be used either to play simple one-off games, or as the combat element of a role-playing game according to your taste.&quot;<br/><br/>&quot;In designing the game I was faced with the usual dilemma concerning personal combat rules reflecting the detail of using the colourful variety of exotic weapons to be found in Japan. Games which try to cater for a blow by blow resolution of combat are usually slow moving and unwieldy - and rarely, if ever, cope with group actions. For these rules I decided to concentrate instead on movement and positioning and reduce the clash of blades to a simple comparative die roll.&quot;<br/><br/>&quot;To do well in this game you need to ensure that you understand the strengths of your own weapon and the weaknesses of your enemy - proper positioning is vital, outnumbering essential. In an equal man-to-man fight the results are usually fairly unpredictable, and can swing suddenly and disastrously one way or another.&quot;<br/><br/>",

Many had already reached sedentarism while others still cultivated the nomadism and due to abundance of food, they didn't develop any pastoral culture. They lived mainly hunting and collecting, not having a writing system, being the oral transmission, the bases of history, but nevertheless they reached a high degree of cultural development. They possessed advanced knowledge of hygienic medicine and astronomy. They possessed a developed religious system and the society was patriarchal, based on the chief of the tribe and the warriors Council.<br/><br/>The Brazilian Indian, according to authors of the period, possessed enormous muscular strength, capable of carring his equivalent in weight great distances, with a high degree of physical resistance. They possessed a very developed tracking capacity, distinguishing sounds and smells of animals and people kilometers away, being capable to hide in the forest, using early camouflage technics, very advanced for the time.<br/><br/>The War<br/><br/>The indigenous wars had a kind of &quot;permanent state in the time&quot;, simply motivated by revenge because of the arrested and devoured relatives by the enemy (anthropophagy was very common), or because of the kidnaping and possession of women of opposing tribes. There were no objective in the conquest of lands or resources, because these were abundant for all.On the deflagration of a campaign, the chief gathers with the council of the tribe to debate about the used strategy, and usually the medicine man, the spiritual leader of the tribe, like a shaman, does the forecasts of the campaign. Setting the day for the beginning of the hostilities, depending on the chief, the organization and preparations of the war, On the day of the beginning of the conflict this same chief, makes speeches to his warriors, some times for six long hours inciting them to the combat and elevating the morals.<br/><br/>Java&eacute; is a wargame for 2 players, wich attempts to simulate the conflict between the Brazilian Indian tribes Ava-Canoeiro and Javae, in colonial time.

        "description": "On September 15 1835, HMS Beagle on its second surveying voyage arrived at the Galapagos Islands.  On board was a young geologist by the name of Charles Darwin.  Over the next five weeks, the ship visited four of the islands of the archipelago.   During these visits, Darwin collected 37 bird specimens he thought unique.  While traveling home, Darwin pondered the variations in beak size of the mockingbirds and finches he had collected.  These slight variations in beak structure, along with other small differences observed in both plants and animals he collected, were the beginnings of a radical new thought in how species came to exist.  Over the next fourteen years, Darwin expanded upon these ideas ultimately publishing his controversial treatise The Origin of Species in 1859.<br/><br/>In this game, players help four species of finch evolve and spread throughout the Galapagos archipelago from one common ancestor.  Species evolve and migrate as they try to dominate the habitable population centers on the islands.  Each species of finch has a preferred habitat, ground or tree, and preferred food source, insects or seeds.  Players can affect the dominate species by increasing the food source or habitat type of a particular species.  At the game end, the player who has the most valuable finch collection is declared the winner.<br/><br/>",

Use your mad math skills to crawl your way up the ladder to the victory!&quot;<br/><br/>Aim of the game:<br/><br/>Be the first to achieve five addition results (10, 10, 10, 12, 12) by moving your three pawns on a track of numbers (values 1-6)<br/><br/>Gameplay:<br/><br/>Each player has 3 coloured movement pawns and 5 white marker pawns. Rolling a d6, on the first three turns both players must first bring all of their pawns on the board; after that they can freely choose which one to move each turn. The idea is, at the end of your turn, to have your pawns standing next to a set of three numbers of the board that make up either 10 or 12, depending on which ones you still need. You can then mark off one of the five sums on your scoring track on the board. It of course makes sense to first calculate which pawn to move before choosing one or, in case of none of them achieving a required result, which one would at least put you in the best position for the next turn.<br/><br/>First player to achieve all five results wins.<br/><br/>",

That player then discards to the left and play continues (the dealer continuing to pick up and discard) with the last player forming a discard pile in front of them.

        "description": "Fantasy Chess is a blend of Traditional Chess and miniatures or role-playing game mechanics where you can co-occupy squares and use dice to determine capture outcomes.<br/><br/>Develop new strategies and alter old ones as you experience familiar chess from a whole new angle.<br/><br/>Traditional King, Queen, Bishop, Knight, Rook, Pawn pieces that move and check the same as traditional chess, but may move through their own ranks, carry pieces, fight for squares (with dice and statistic sheet) and MORE!<br/><br/>Start off with the basic game that teaches how to co-occupy squares (you can have up to three of your own pieces in square) and how to fight for the square (attack the enemy piece using two six sided die against your own dexterity.  If you inflict damage, it lowers the enemy piece's life points.)  If several pieces are in a combat square, they all get an attack.  If it doesn't resolve in one swing each, then combat is continued in the next person's turn.  This means that you can send in re-inforcements.  Each piece class has different dexterity and hit points and some have armor.  All of this is listed on an easy to read stat sheet with bubbles to fill in for damage.<br/><br/>Check is handled in traditional style of check and checkmate.  But there are times when you can actually go head to head with the king in his square and check mate him.<br/><br/>The advanced game includes 4 more rules:<br/><br/>    Withdrawal (escaping from a combat square)<br/>    Healing (Bishops and Queens can heal damaged pieces)<br/>    Forced Retreat (Queens can kick other pieces out of her square)<br/>    Carrying (Knights can carry a pawn or a bishop and Rooks can carry anything except another rook or the king)<br/><br/><br/>In Advanced Tournament Games, winning pieces are declared veteran and they go up a rank either getting more hit points, do more damage or improve dexterity.<br/><br/>Fantasy Chess has the capacity for 4 player games.<br/>Bump two Fantasy Chess boards next to each other and play ally with your partner with full use of both boards as you try to checkmate your opponents.<br/><br/>This can even be expanded into a 5+ player game by either bumping more boards together or having a Game Master who can run some home rule creature pieces as interference or aid to the two main players.  Try putting two rows of squares as a forest between the two boards.<br/><br/>A Chess game where your Knights can charge from Castles, Bishops can heal the injured, Six piece battles can be fought in a square, and you can bludgeon a King to death!<br/><br/>You can obtain Fantasy Chess&reg; from the official website:  <a target='_blank' href=\"http://www.shadowhex.com\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer noopener\">www.shadowhex.com</a> or at [<a target='_blank' href=\"http://www.kickstarter.com/projects/869058411/fantasy-chess-a-fight-for-the-square-chess-variant?ref=bggforums\" rel=\"nofollow\">www.kickstarter.com/projects/869058411/fantasy-chess-a-fight...</a>] until 7 Nov 2011.<br/><br/>",

Whenever an object is mentioned that corresponds with one of the cards or figures, the children should grab that card or figure from the table. If they take the correct item, they get to keep it. Whomever has the most items at the end of the story wins the game.<br/>    Focus Pocus!: Six random cards and/or figures are placed on the table. The game leader reads out a story. Whenever an object is mentioned that corresponds with one of the cards or figures that is not in the table, the children should react by saying &quot;it's in the box&quot;. The first player to do so, gets an item from the table. Whenever an object is mentioned that corresponds with one of the cards or figures that is already held by one of the players, the children should react by saying &quot;it's already gone&quot;. The first player to do so, gets an item from the table. Whomever has the most items at the end of the story wins the game.<br/>    Stories about Kindergarten: In turn, each player choose a figure and draw a card. They then tell a short story about that figure and the item on the card. The card is then placed facedown next to the figure. This continues until there are four cards in front of each figure. Then, the players take turn rolling the die. They then have to remember what item is on the first card next to the figure corresponding to the colour rolled. If they guess correctly, they get to keep the card. Whomever has the most cards at the end of the story wins the game.<br/>    What does it do?: In turn, each player chooses a card and describes what you can do with the item on the card. The other players then guess what card is being described. Whomever guesses correctly gets to keep the card. The game continues until only three cards are left. Whomever has the most cards at the end of the story wins the game.<br/><br/><br/>",

        "description": "Krampus,the dark twin to that jolly elf Santa Claus, is tired of his diminished and secondary role in the Christmas holiday, and has booby-trapped Santa's sleigh.  The sleigh has flown off on it's own and now it is a race: Krampus is out to ruin everyone's night by stealing gifts and Santa is trying to retreive the sleigh and deliver the presents.<br/>The board consists of eighteen areas, the north and south poles which are the base points for the Santa and Krumpus players.  The sleigh is placed in the center of the board.  The game includes three dice, hand painted with both numbers and the following symbols:<br/>1,2 :footprints<br/>3,4  :sleigh<br/>5    :a spring<br/>6    :a hand<br/>and on one die, a three is an asterisk, representing a wild face.  The game may be played with normal dice, but one 3 face must be marked to represent the wild symbol.<br/>Setup continues by rolling the dice six times (3d6) and laying cubes that represent the gift targets on the resulting spaces, which are numbered from 3-18 (1 and 2 are the poles, and will never have gift targets placed on them.)<br/>The dice and the player's tokens are manipulated using the dice.  Each turn the player may roll 3 times, keeping a die or two each time.  If a die is kept, it must be used at the end of rolling, there is no deciding to reroll later.  Whatever is rolled on the third roll is kept and used.  <br/>Keep on footprint to move one space, two to move three spaces, and keep three footprints to move four spaces.  Movement is orthogonal only, never diagonal.<br/>Keep one sleigh to move the sleign one space orthogonally, two to move three, three to move hour.  In addition, if the player's token is in the same space as the sleigh, you must roll two sleighs to board the sleigh.  Once on the sleigh, the sleigh is moved with either footprints or sleighs (not a combination of both, though you may wait until the end of the third roll to decide which you will use to move the sleigh.)  Move the sleigh to bring it closer to you, or to keep the other player from intercepting it.  The sleigh may not be moved remotely if the other player is riding it.<br/>Roll and keep three springs to eject a player riding the sleigh back to his or her base.  (In variant play, any gifts on the sleigh at this point remain aboard)  While unlikely, it is possible to eject yourself from the sleigh if you roll all three dice three times and it pops up.  If so, too bad, back to base with yourself!<br/>If on the sleigh and in the same space as a package, roll and keep two hands to deliver the package as Santa or steal the package as the Krampus. In either case, place the package in your base as a point.  <br/>The wild symbol may substitute for any other in the above combinations.<br/><br/>Winner is player to pick up the most gift tokens when the last one is picked up, ties going to Santa, because it's Christmas, after all.<br/><br/>Variant Challenge 1: To 'win' a gift and get the point, you must return to your base with it (no roll required to drop it)<br/><br/>Variant Challenge 2: Use Variant Challenge 1, but the other player may also steal gifts from your base, and the winner is the first to get ALL the gifts.<br/><br/>",

        "description": "Tigele is the first volume of a 4 volume game/game system. Tigele like the other Volumes is a standalone game. Meaning as it comes out of the box,  it is a working game. Tigele may be added to other volumes as an expansion. Or the other volumes may be added to it, in part or whole, as expansions. Or this volume may be mixed with parts of the other volumes to form whole new games.<br/><br/>Tigele is a battle strategy game made up of 100 tiles comprised of 72 pictographs forming just several tile types. the game was played by a small community of individuals in the North west corner of Montana for almost 20 years. Slowly evolving into this publish version. (Long cold winters and beer)<br/><br/>Oddities of the game:<br/>1) We call the game a board game, even though it is a tile game; because, the tiles in part make up the playing area, a 10 X 10 layout of tile we call a field. The field is comprised of two opponents laid out in 10 X 5 (1/2 the field we call the courts). That area once established remains a constant grid for play throughout the game. Thus the tiles making a randomized board.<br/><br/>2) The tiles used above are the playing board and the playing pieces.<br/><br/>3) The game uses the relationships of one tiles to another as a mechanic to manipulate luck, and unforeseen or uncontrolled  events. This also encourages ever developing tactics and interpersonal strategies (more so when later volumes are played in concert with one another).<br/><br/>4) The box instructions gives two player mode instruction. but the game plays up to 4 players in the Volume One level. The 3 and 4 player modes of play are suggested on our web site.<br/><br/>5) The game was designed for two primary reasons. To help keep the designer brother out of trouble and as a model of one basic form of social political behavior...Don't ask me.<br/><br/>6) Hard rules augmented with a few soft rules. the soft rules force personal interaction and create a fog of war atmosphere...again don't ask me...it just works.<br/><br/>7) Players on your side of play may or may not really be playing on your side.<br/><br/>8) The game uses its art as a fog of war mechanism.<br/><br/>9) The game has a slight learning curve; but the game is basic in  play.<br/><br/>",

Players roll two dodeca, 12-sided dice colored with 3 different spots, to determine how they may place a piece on the 10&times;10 board. Players can play only on their own color, but the dice roll determines how many friendly or enemy pieces the new piece may be adjacent to.<br/><br/>The goal is to form 5 quinx. A quinx is an arrangement of 5 pieces in an X shape, as found on the 5 of a standard-pipped six-sided die. This shape is sometimes known as a quincunx, from which the game gets its name.<br/><br/>The dice thrown by each player are the same as found in Kansil's game Krakatoa. Each player has a pair in their color, and each die has 3 yellow, 4 red, and 5 blue spots.<br/><br/>Out of print for many years, this is reportedly the hardest Joli Kansil/Xanadu Leisure game to find.<br/><br/>",

        "description": "Originally created for a now-defunct contest in December 2010, which required that the game be playable in the iggc sandbox, use conversion capture, and be won by the player with the majority of stones.  Though the game can as easily be played with pen and paper, and with variable victory thresholds rather than balancing stones, the rules are presented here as submitted.<br/><br/>Basic rules:<br/>Players alternately place one stone at a time in an empty space on a board with an odd number of hexagonal cells.  Normally, Black may only place white stones, while White may place either white or black stones.  If the placement of a white stone completes one or more unbroken rows of four or more white stones, all stones in these rows flip to black.  When the board is full, the player with more stones of their color on the board wins.<br/><br/>Balancing stones:<br/>On most standard boards, White has a small but definite advantage. It is suggested to give Black a limited number of black stones which may be played at any time during the game in place of their usual white stone. Though a 'pie-rule' arrangement can ensure that both players agree on the appropriate number of such stones, CPU self-play suggests the following setups as fair, and the 9x9x9 is particularly recommended.<br/><br/>6x6x6    Black gets 5 black stones, white gets first move.<br/>7x7x7    Black gets 4 black stones and first move.<br/>8x8x8    Black gets 3 black stones, White gets first move.<br/>9x9x9    Black gets 3 black stones, White gets first move.<br/>10x10x10 Black gets 2 black stones and first move.<br/><br/>Note that once one accounts for the balancing stones, players may mark cells which can no longer be flipped as white, since Black may not play a black stone there, and White should never choose to.<br/><br/>(submitted by designer)<br/><br/>",

        "description": "Colorado Smith and the Sacred Temple is a tongue-in-cheek boardgame adaptation of popular pulp adventure movies like Indiana Jones. An evil priest wants to sacrifice a virgin priestess of the forces of Light to his deity (some unspeakable horror with tentacles of course). Just like in the movies, the players reach the ceremonial altar just in time to prevent the sacrifice, but each of them has different goals.<br/><br/>The game can be played with three or six players (in which case there are two of each character). The game characters are an adventurer, whose first objective is to steal the jewels embedded in the idols and his second to rescue the princess, an avenger (whose first goal is to kill the priest, then to steal the jewels) and the father of the priestess (whose goal is to save his daughter, then to kill the priest). Each character gains victory points according to his goals, the player with the most victory points win. Each character also has different stats and equipment.<br/><br/>During a game turn, the priest is moved on the board, then players move and fight, then if a player's character or a dead body is in the line of sight of the priest or a cultist, the player roll a die and consult a table indicating what happens (the cultists may move or shoot arrows, the priest may try to possess one of the characters for one more turns).<br/><br/>The game ends when all the characters are either dead or have left the board.<br/><br/>The game was published in Casus Belli magazine issue #23: Casus Belli (Issue 23 - Dec 1984)<br/><br/>",

The two players, called &quot;white&quot; and &quot;black&quot;, alternately take turns placing their pieces on the playing field, or stacking them on their previously played pieces. Once a piece is played, it is never removed from the board. Splay is a game where the players are constantly battling for territory acquisition. A space which has a player&rsquo;s piece(s) on it represents a unit of territory which is owned by that player. A &quot;tower&quot; consists of one or more like-colored checkers stacked on top of one another. A tower represents potential for acquiring additional territory. Players who utilize their towers effectively will gain a territorial advantage. Towers can also pose a liability so they must be developed with care.<br/><br/>Splay was inspired by the process by which borders are formed between competing entities.<br/><br/>Please refer to the included &quot;Splay_Rules.pdf&quot; for a complete description of the rules.<br/><br/>Splay placed first in the 2011 rec.games.abstract stacking games contest.<br/><br/>",

The playing pieces are grey plastic units which have one nearly flat colored end with some 3D pattern, and one &quot;diagonal&quot; one.<br/><br/>- In ORY, the players place all the pieces into the box and pull out two of them at a time, hoping to find two in which the patterns fit into each other. Whoever locates most pairs this way is the winner.<br/>- In DO, two random pieces are placed on the table. In his/her turn, a player tries to add a piece that fits the pattern and another one of his/her choice. A player who cannot add pieces has to draw a new one from the box. The goal is to get rid of one's pieces first.<br/><br/>",

        "description": "Crisis Dice is a cold war dice game with complexity more akin to 'Zombie dice' than 'Twilight Struggle'.<br/><br/>Crisis Dice is a very light, quick-playing, low-complexity game for 1-2 players aged 8 and up.It lasts between 15 to 20 minutes and emulates a tiny portion of the tension and political unrest between the former Soviet Union and the United States of America during the month of October in 1962.<br/><br/>In this game players will try to infiltrate the heart of their opponent&rsquo;s government and in doing so gain military intelligence that will help prevent political tension, misunderstanding and ultimately a nuclear war. A peaceful victory with propaganda bonuses is the preferred outcome for either side.<br/><br/>Be the first super power to place their Event Marker onto the Victory space at the end of the Event Track before the opposition and before the DEFCON level reaches one.<br/><br/>Rules summary.....<br/><br/>1. Roll for initiative. Both sides roll a single 6 sided dice the highest score wins initiative for that turn.<br/><br/>2. Place Agency Focus Marker. The winner of the initiative roll chooses one of the four Agency Focus Actions at the top of his side of the game board and moves his Agency Focus Marker from its agency home space to the chosen action space. These bonuses are added to the Spy Dice rolls in the next part of the turn where a score of 5 or 6 is deemed successful. The player that lost initiative then chooses his action (he may not duplicate the action chosen by the winner of initiative for that turn) and places his marker.<br/><br/>3. Roll Spy Dice. Both sides roll all of their available coloured Spy Dice. Dice that have been placed within the Kremlin or The White House during previous turns may not be rolled again and remain where they are until the end of that round. On turn one both players will have 3 dice to roll.<br/><br/>4. Agency Focus bonuses are applied. The chosen Agency Focus Bonus is applied to any one of the rolled Spy Dice, starting with the player who won initiative in step one.<br/><br/>5. Spies infiltrate places of power. Successful spies (those dice that scored a roll of 5 or 6 with any bonuses applied) are deemed to have successfully infiltrated their chosen place of power i.e. Kremlin for U.S. spies or The White House for soviet spies and are placed into the appropriate area on the game board.<br/><br/>6. Repeat steps 1 to 5. These steps are repeated 3 times or until either player has placed all 3 of his spies into the appropriate spy placement area. The first player to do this is deemed the winner of that round and moves his Event Marker one place closer to the Victory space. Players must raise DEFCON level by 1 if indicated by text above event track. If both players fail to place all 3 of their spies into their appropriate spy placement areas then an intelligence stalemate is declared and the DEFCON Marker is raised one level.<br/><br/>7. Return Spies and Agency Focus Markers. All 3 Spy Dice are returned to each player and the Agency Focus Markers are returned to their Agency Home Space ready for the next round.<br/><br/>8. Repeat steps 1 to 7 until one side places their Event Marker onto the Victory space and reads the printed outcome or until the DEFCON level reaches one indicating the start of a worldwide thermo nuclear war and both sides lose.<br/><br/>",

When a ball settles into an indentation, the first to press the lever, 'passes' the ball, with the intention of sendint it to another position. The cover on the pitch means that the ball cannot leave the board and roll on to the floor. The goalkeepers are worked by slides so that they can be moved sideways to save shots.<br/><br/>",

Each player has a sufficiency of coloured triangular shapes of a similar size to those marked on the board. The shapes of each player are of a distinctive colour. The objective is to place these pieces on the board and form quadrilaterals.<br/><br/>In turn, each player places one of his pieces in a triangular space on the board, touching another piece already on the board (excepting of course the first piece laid). They may touch either along adjacent sides or at the points.<br/><br/>Quadrilaterals of many different shapes and sizes can be formed. Some examples are shown in diagram 2. The only quadrilateral which does not count towards a score is one formed by placing two pieces edge to edge (diagram 3). In order for a player to score points for a quadrilateral the following conditions must be satisfied:<br/>1.    Exactly half of the counters forming the quadrilateral must be of the colour of the player who has completed it;<br/>2.    The perimeter of the quadrilateral must not at any point pass between two counters of the same colour;<br/>3.

All the deeds, spaces on the board and cards feature locations and landmarks from San Antonio.<br/><br/>Players roll dice to determine how far they move.  Landing on a space gives the player the option of buying the property.  When a player collects all the properties in one color group, the properties can be improved by first building skylines, and then upgrading to keys to the city. When players land on a space owned by another player they must pay rent.  Rent is determined by the location of the property and the number of improvements on the space.  Some spaces instruct a player to draw a card which can be beneficial or harmful to the player. Players must avoid going bankrupt to stay in the game.  The winner is the last player left in the game.<br/><br/>",

        "description": "Card game that features four different games but all are fairly traditional. 36 cards being 17 with an animal, 17 with a food associated with an animal, 1 Wolf card and 1 Red Riding Hood card.<br/><br/>For game 1 use all the cards except Red Riding Hood and her Cake. The Wolf will be the Schwarzer Peter (Old Maid) card. Whoever holds it when all the cards are paired, loses. Note for this and other games, the pairing of two cards are not the same image. You must match a food card with an animal card, i.e. Squirrel and Nuts.<br/><br/>For game 2, use all the cards. The Wolf and Little Red Riding Hood count as a pair. Turn all the cards upside down randomly. Draw two cards and if a pair, take them. When all the pairs are matched up, the one with the most pairs, wins.<br/><br/>Game 3 is a slight variation of Game 2. Take out the Wolf and Little Red Riding Hood. Still matching pairs but the cards are divided into animal cards on the left and food cards on the right. I guess this is seen as a little easier for younger children.<br/><br/>Game 4 is played like a Lotto variant. Each player gets an equal number of animal cards. The Caller has the deck of food cards. He will turn one over and announce it i.e. Thistle. If a player has the donkey card (who eats the thistle) then he can turn over his donkey card. The first player to turn over all their animal cards, wins.<br/><br/>Note that the box is an extending box. This means that it is a regular size but the sleeve inside can be lowered to show a much longer box image. This idea was probably first used by J W Spear in Bavaria but is releatively uncommon. Indeed, this is the first French game I have seen with this feature.<br/><br/>",

In addition to the original Ticket to Ride Europe this map contains routes which are 7 waggons in length - scoring 18 points.<br/><br/>2. The design and illustration is truly unique and awesome. The ferry routes are multi-colored (instead of having the original's grey color / locomotive symbol on it). Due to the integration of some &quot;overseas&quot;-destinations, a lot of ferries are available. The same is true for tunnels, which are indicated by rounded boxes. Here, I was missing the clearer tunnel borders from the original, but it is not a big disadvantage. The tickets look wonderful - long and short routes are clearly distinguishable. A lot of love, energy and enthusiam has been put into the illustration. Congratulations.<br/><br/>3. The scoring track is a great novelty as it uses railroad tracks in the background which looks really nice.<br/><br/>",

The caller also has a deck of cards which is dealt by turning up one card at a time and names the card for all to hear, i.e. Suzie 1, Phoenix 6, Smart Dresser etc.<br/><br/>The player with the card called out places the card from his/her hand face upwards on the table. The caller continues to call out the names of the cards until a player lays down the last card in his/her hand and calls out Super Six.<br/><br/>As the caller calls out the card dealt the card is placed on the table so that a cross-check can be taken for the winning hand.<br/><br/>The cards are a little odd. One would expect only to have greyhound cards but not so, there are Mascot, Trophy, Kennel, and four individual cards that have no category to fit them in. I think the original game must have been more complicated, taking advantage of all these cards but as publication date drew near, the charity probably felt worried about this and cut out all rules except as described above, reducing the game to little more than Lotto.<br/><br/>",

        "description": "Insurgence is an assymetric PnP two-player game that pits brave rebels against an evil empire in a futuristic capital. Or maybe it's a benevolent empire against cruel terrorists - the victor will decide.<br/><br/>The game is played on a 3x3 grid of tiles that make up the districts of the capital. Both players use action cards to move pawns around the districts, but they each have very different goals.<br/><br/>The rebels use hidden rebel cells and their rebel leader to fulfil plots by doing sabotage, making assasinations, and spreading propaganda throughout the districts. If the rebel player fulfils two out of three plots, he/she wins the game. But the rebels also work on causing uprising in the districts. This allows riots to spread from the slums towards the imperial palace. If that happens, the rebels also win.<br/><br/>The empire player, meanwhile, try to either uncover the plots by sorrounding cells with armies and revealing them, or to capture the rebel leader by clever use of both armies and the secret police. If the empire player uncovers all three plots or captures the leader, he/she wins.<br/><br/>In order to win you have to plan carefully while still being able to adapt to an unlucky draw of action cards. But most of all you'll have to both outwit and outbluff your opponent.<br/><br/>",

Each space has a maximum capacity (depending on which column it is in), and when you get that many of your pieces in a space it explodes, sending the pieces to orthogonally adjacent spaces.

You will be collecting supply cards, surviving events, and interacting with other players.<br/><br/>Gameplay: Every player starts the game with a party leader card that grants special abilities along with 3 party members. If all 3 party members die, you lose and the game continues. In the center of the table are destination decks that every player is trying to travel to. To travel to a destination, you spend the required resources shown, acquire the card, and move on to the next destination. The player that gets the set of 2 rivers, and 3 cities, ends the game and wins after a final round if no other players collect all their destinations. Your party size is used as a tiebreaker if needed. <br/>Each player turn consists of drawing cards, playing actions (on themselves or other players), traveling to a destination, and discarding cards.<br/><br/>",

        "description": "Stormy Weather is two player game about two mad scientists competing to win a gardening trophy, using a series of increasingly powerful weather machines. Play takes place on a 3x5 board, where each square has one of five types of weather. Players take on the identity (and abilities) of one of the mad scientists.<br/><br/>Players use their weather machines to move or create weather, with the aim of getting good weather to their side of the board or giving bad weather to their opponents. These can range from the humble remote control cloud to the gargantuan Noahmatic or the planetary realigner. Each machine can normally be used once per round, so the sequencing of play is important. At the end of each turn, sun and rain help gardens to grow, while heatwave and lightning cause them to wither and die.<br/><br/>The final action of the game comes from the play of a 'taunt' card, which contains a special, hidden move and an associated threat to yell at your opponent.<br/><br/>The player with the most flowers at the end of the game will be the winner.<br/><br/>",

Each card depicts an event in the history of the Belgian television, with the year in which that event occurred on only one side. Players take turns placing a card from their hand in a row on the table. After placing the card, the player reveals the date on it. If the card was placed correctly with the date in chronological order with all other cards on the table, the card stays in place; otherwise the card is removed from play and the player takes another card from the deck.<br/><br/>The first player to get rid of all his cards by placing them correctly wins. If multiple players go out in the same round, then everyone else is eliminated from play and each of those players are dealt one more card for another round of play. If only one player has no cards after a bonus round, he wins; otherwise play continues until a single player goes out.<br/><br/>Timeline: 60 ans de t&eacute;l&eacute;vision &agrave; la RTBF can be combined with any other title in the Timeline series.<br/><br/>",

Players take turns placing counters from their personal sets, of which they have three in hand.<br/><br/>Scoring does not begin until the fourth round, to allow numbers to build up on the board. During the initial three rounds players may not place a counter if the total in a straight line in any direction would exceed 21.<br/><br/>From the fourth round on, players aim to place counters so that they complete lines adding up to 21. The basic score for a line adding up to 21 is 5 points, but 10 points can be scored by placing the counter on a square that matches the colour of your own pieces, or more by placing the counter on squares marked 15, 20 or 30, scoring that many points respectively.<br/><br/>When a line adding up to 21 is scored, the counter that was last placed is turned face down. No counters may be placed adjacent to such a counter, except for the counter with a star, which counts as 21 in its own right.<br/><br/>The game ends when one player has used all his counters on no player is able to play.<br/><br/>The player with the highest score is the winner.<br/><br/>",

Although the cakes belong to specific players, the players may freely use each others' ingredients and parts to bake them. All players participating in a cake will score but only when it is completed and only if the cake wins the final contest.<br/><br/>Bake the Cake! is not about baking your own cake first but rather contribute most to the winning cake. To stop other players, you may take the ingredients they want, use the kitchen tools they need and even eat their ingredients (but not too many or you will get a stomache ache).<br/><br/>The gameplay is quick and intensive as the players fight to get hold of the ingredients and the tools, not unlike what it would be in a real kitchen with too many bakers. Behind the playful theme hides a tactical game where each player must play her cards well to spread her colors to all cakes and at the same get as many other players to them as possible. Please don't try the game recipes at home and don't eat the winning cake!<br/><br/>Game meachanisms include:<br/><br/>Economy: The players use ingredients and tools to accomplish their objective. <br/>Interdependence: The players compete about the same resources but may also earn points for each other. <br/>Take that: Players may interfere each other by blocking tools or eating ingredients. <br/>Balanced victory condition: To win, a player must ensure that other players score as well.<br/><br/>",

However, a veggie card can't be substituted as veggies make integral part of a healthy meal :)<br/><br/>Once you've constructed a meal, put the meal on the desk for everyone to see. If you've used a Q card to substitute a food card (let's say your meal doesn't have a Fruit card and you've used a Q card to replace it), another player can insert a Fruit card on your meal as process of gradually discarding his cards...<br/><br/>Aside from this function of substitution, Q card can be used: a) to neutralize a junk card that has been used to destroy a meal. <br/>b) with a Q card you can ask (during your turn) another player (whose turn is after you) to show you a random card from the ones that he is holding (you don't get to see the card before picking it) and you can decide 1) to keep the card for you and put your Q card on the discard pile OR 2) you can decide not to take the card from the other player and keep your Q card.<br/><br/>Junk card: the only function of this card is to destroy a healthy meal. There's nothing healthy about junk food. Players can discard this card by using it to destroy someone else's meal. All you need to do is place a junk card next to a meal...<br/>The only way to neutralize a junk card is to put a put a Q card after it...Ex: if you have 3 cards in hand and you've already created a meal, and someone places a junk card on your meal, you can neutralize that junk card by placing a Q card on it (if you have one or are lucky to draw one)<br/><br/>Unlike most other card games, Qetchup doesn't require you to always draw a card and discard one during your turn. While this is certainly an option for an intuitive game play, you can simply discard a card by using one of it's functions. Ex: by placing a junk card to mess up someone's meal OR using a food card to add to a meal where Q card has been used to substitute it( without having to pick another card from the draw pile).<br/><br/>If you have a Restart card, you can use it to make any other player restart their game from scratch by choosing a fresh set of 8 cards (that even if he's constructed a meal | his entire meal and discard pile are then shuffled back in with the existing draw pile to form a new draw pile from which he gets 8 new cards) Restart card goes back in the discard pile.<br/><br/>",

The game board represents a football-field divided into zones with a black number (in favour of the orange player) and zones with a white number (for the red player). Players have to reach their opponent&rsquo;s goal by throwing 2 dice at once. Starting from the middle they put the ball forward on the opponent&rsquo;s half as many places as they have thrown. A player may continue during the same turn until the ball lands on a zone with a number in the opponent&rsquo;s colour. The ball keeps moving to and from until a goal has been scored (reaching no. 45 exactly). Then the other player starts in the middle again.Some zones are yellow-coloured which represent certain events like free kick, penalty or corner with their respective special actions. The player who scored most goals during playing time of 2x15 minutes wins the game. If both players scored an equal amount of goals it is a draw.<br/><br/>",

Those cards are the candidates that might be selected to become members of the &quot;Circle of UNICUMS&quot;. <br/>Players secretly write down 3 of the candidates they think will enter the circle (one as early as possible, two as late as possible).<br/>Then by turn players may nominate one candidate and advance a reason, why this canditate is unique. Other players my support or object this argument.<br/>A candidate can only enter the circle, if a majority of the players agrees.<br/>After a certain number of rounds, players reveal their notes and score points for all cards on their note that made it into the &quot;Circle of UNICUMS&quot; (depending on their position). The player with the highest score wins.<br/><br/>",

        "description": "Quick Step is a smart amusement game full of surprises for 2 or 4 people. Luck is not determining because it depends very much on where to best move your stone. Each game of QUICK STEP is exciting and full of new contingencies to which you must respond tactically smart and clever.<br/><br/>Quick Step is, as the name implies, a fast, quick lively game that invites to play several games in a row to determine the overall winner.<br/><br/>Setup Quick Step:<br/>With 2 players, each player gets four double-sided pieces (green/red) and builds a tower with it. One player puts all the green sides face up and the other player puts all the red sides up. The towers are then placed in the big starting circle marked with red and green. <br/>With 4 players, the blue/yellow pieces are used also. Setup is the same, but blue and yellow start at the other big circle, playing then in the other direction.<br/><br/>Playing Quick Step:<br/>Roll the Dice. Move one piece that shows your color. If you land on an empty space, turn your piece face down (now the color of your opponent is visible!). If you land on any other piece(s), don't turn your pice face down. All pieces under your piece are now blocked and cannot move until you move your piece away. If you roll a &quot;6&quot;, don't turn your piece face dawn, even if you land on an empty space.<br/>It may happen that your color is not visible when it is your turn. Then you just skip your turn. The situation on the board may change and then you can play again.<br/>To reach the end of the track, you have to roll exactly the needed number and you don't turn your piece face down then.<br/><br/>The winner is the person who moves one piece directly into the ending circle.<br/><br/>&mdash;description from the back of the box (translated)<br/><br/>The players start at the starting position of their color. Movement is determined by a die. The first player to get one of his playing tokens to the end of the track wins the game. At the roll of a 1,2,3,4 or 5, if a token lands on a free space, it is turned over to it's other color and belongs to the opposite player. If a token lands on an occupied space, it is put onto the first token without being flipped over. Only the upper token in a stack may move. If a token reaches the finish, it is not flipped over.<br/><br/>&mdash;user summary<br/><br/>",

You want the Fantastic Four team--Mr. Fantastic, Human Torch, Invisible Woman, and The Thing--to go on an exploration mission with you.  You must reach them all before you can fly away with them.  But Dr. Doom, Mole Man, and Annihilus are out there to prevent you from carrying out your plan.  However, you can count on Silver Surfer to give you a helping hand.<br/><br/>Fantastic Four was published as part of the Marvel Comics Super Heroes Game Book, and the board is a double-page spread of the book which is laid flat to play.<br/><br/>Each player starts with four markers and rolls two dice (or in this case presses the &quot;electronic die&quot; twice), multiplying the numbers.  They then place a marker on a space that displays the resulting number.  If another marker is already on the space, the marker must be placed on another matching space. If the square has instructions, the player follows those instructions. If the player lands on a space with a villain, their marker is stuck there until all other markers are placed. A Silver Surfer space allows the player to move the marker to any space. The first player to place one marker on each member of the Fantastic Four wins.<br/><br/>",

Coconots want to grab coconuts from the field, with those coconuts ideally lying in a straight line.<br/><br/>To set up the game, place the &quot;Las-nut&quot; card in the center of a 3x3 grid, then shuffle the other coconut cards and lay eight of them in the surrounding spaces of the grid, removing any unused cards from the game. The coconut cards have powers on them that come into effect when that card is active during the game.<br/><br/>The game lasts nine rounds. Each player has a deck of monkey cards numbered 1-10, and to start play, they each shuffle their deck, lay two cards at random face down in the front of them (looking at them whenever they like), then take a hand of three cards. In a round, the players look at the coconut card for this round (as indicated on the Las-nut card), choose a monkey card in hand, then reveal them simultaneously. If two or more players lay down the same card, they're out for the round. After taking into account the coconut's power, whoever played the highest card wins the round and places a token on the card.<br/><br/>The Las-nut card is claimed in the final round, with whoever has the highest total in the two cards set aside claiming it. (These cards can possibly be swapped during play.)<br/><br/>If a player has ever placed three tokens in a line on the grid, that player wins immediately. If this doesn't happen, whoever has placed the most tokens (with the Las-nut counting as two) wins.<br/><br/>",

        "description": "Pics &amp; Circumstance&copy;<br/>Tom &amp; Pete Games<br/><br/>Once, long ago, there was a glorious leader who faced many challenging circumstances. Fortunately, the glorious leader had a council of wise and creative advisers who would help him to understand various things about these circumstances. Some advisers would provide examples of the circumstances; other advisers would explain the cause of the circumstances, and others still would offer solutions to the different circumstances. Prepare yourself for such trials and tribulations, for you will have to be creative and clever if you wish to be declared the best adviser ever!<br/><br/>Game Contents <br/>170 picture cards <br/> 30 circumstance cards<br/><br/>Objective: <br/>Each round, one player will judge the advice offered by the other players and decide whose advice was the best. The player whose advice is chosen the most by the end of the game is the winner.<br/><br/>Game Setup <br/>1. First decide which game you will be using (i.e. game A, B, or C). <br/>2. Divide the cards into one stack of circumstance cards and one or more stack(s) of picture cards.<br/>3. Each player draws 10 picture cards to form his or her playing hand. Players are allowed to look through their hand, but should keep their cards hidden from the prying eyes of the other advisers.<br/>4. The player who is closest to the age of 18 becomes the first judge.<br/><br/>Turn Sequence <br/>1. The judge flips over a circumstance card and reads aloud the circumstance for the appropriate game (e.g. &ldquo;Our Glorious Leader demands that his laundry be softer.&rdquo;) <br/>2. Each of the other advisers plays one picture card from his or her hand and explains how it relates to the circumstance. (e.g. &ldquo;We shall use this mighty chainsaw to inspire the imperial clothes washers into improving their job performance.&rdquo;) <br/>3. The judge selects the card/explanation that he or she likes the best. <br/>4. The winning adviser keeps that circumstance card as a victory point. <br/>5. The picture cards that were just played are discarded and players draw back up to a hand of 10 picture cards (Note: circumstance cards do count against the hand limit and do not need to be held.) If the deck of picture cards runs out, discarded cards can be reshuffled to form a new deck.<br/>6. The adviser to the left of the judge becomes the new judge, draws a new circumstance card, reads it aloud, and so on and so forth. <br/>7. The game ends after the last circumstance is resolved. The player with the most victory points is declared the best adviser ever! (All of the loser advisors should then sing a song commemorating the greatness of the winning advisor.)<br/><br/>Game Play Variations <br/>Suggestion Box: Players place their cards face down in front of the judge. After all players have done so, the Judge shuffles them, reveals them, and decides which of them is the winner without any further input from the advisers. This style prevents people from playing favorites.<br/><br/>Bards against Humanity: Incorporate the picture cards into your other party style games to allow for more flexibility in play.<br/><br/>Become Famous: Post your own variants on the Pics &amp; Circumstance website under the Officially Unofficial Variants section.<br/><br/>For More Information<br/>Please visit us at Facebook.com/PicsAndCircumstance<br/> &copy; Copyright 2015 Tom &amp; Pete Games, LLC all rights reserved.<br/><br/>",

Will you be the best builder and figure out a way to win, and get the title of Robot Builder Master?<br/><br/>Tiny Robots is a memory- and puzzle game, where players take turns building their robots from pieces available. All pieces represents different robotic parts available for building. Pieces are arranged to gaming area with circuit side up. This way all players can see pieces available, and look for their next piece to take. On the hidden side are robotic parts. Parts include heads, legs, wheels, arms, canisters, cameras etc. But parts also have different colors and Technical points added to them. When building a robot, players try to arrange their circuit sides into as whole circuitry as possible.<br/><br/>Players can do 4 things during their turn, in any order they want:<br/><br/>     Pick a piece from the table and add it to their pile.<br/>     Turn 3 pieces around from the table<br/>     Remove one piece from their pile.<br/>     Declare your robot as ready.<br/><br/><br/>Players can look at the robotic side from their own pieces at any times. After players are done with their turn, player order goes clockwise. After players have at least 3 pieces arranged the way they want, they can declare their robot completed. When a robot is completed, it is then given points. Points are calculated from amount of pieces used, unified colors of robotic parts, complexity points and deduction of points from any mistakes on circuitry side.<br/><br/>Game consists of 125 gaming pieces, and players can choose game length with 25, 50, 75, 100 or full amount of 125 pieces. Regular game lasts until either all the pieces are taken or players don't want any piece. Goal of the game is to get more points than other players when the game ends.<br/><br/>",

These cards are dealt/picked up alongwith tickets in the same quantity and with the same 'keep/dispose' rules. Some of the cards give you extra facilities to complete your tickets. There are also up to 9 bonuses for the end-of-game scoring.<br/><br/>The board does not have any grey tracks or parallel tracks, though there are limited selective options for these.<br/><br/>The main new rule is the option to discard 5 cards and pick up 5 new ones, as your turn.  This is very useful if you are desperate for engines or a particular colour card. You can also call time when your wagon stock reaches 3, if you want, giving you the advantage of stopping other players completing tickets.<br/><br/>",

        "description": "Once upon a time there was someone who loved telling stories... well if you know that someone, then they'll be a winner at playing The Story Telling Game! Whether they tell tall, short, fairy or scary stories, this fast-paced game will be a best-seller for children aged six upwards who have a vivid imagination, a competitive streak and are quick thinking. The Story Telling Game is a great birthday and Christmas gift and it not only encourages creativity, but it will keep children entertained on rainy days and school holidays. Created for budding Jackanorys, The Story Telling Game sees each player start with five words on their cards and when the clock starts, the first players starts telling a story using one of their words. Then it's the turn of the next player who has to incorporate one of their words into the former player's story... and so it goes on with each player adding to the story with one of their words at a time until the buzzer declares that it's 'The End' for the player who's talking when the buzzer sounds. When this happens, the player has to pick up all the cards used by the other players and begin a new story, this time with the opening 'Twice upon a time'. The story doesn't have to win awards or be a work of literary genius - it can be about anything but has to include one of the words on each of their cards. The Smiley Trump card adds a twist to the game as it can be used as any word and if a player is caught out by the buzzer, the Smiley Trump means they get off scot-free and the next player has to collect all the cards.<br/><br/>",

        "description": "Mana War is an original card game created with the spirit of simplicity, inclusion, and creativity in mind. There are 50 cards in the game (5 suits: Sun, Water, Fire, Rock, and Leaf; 10 of each). There are no numbers or values to the cards, no text to read or instructions to follow on the cards themselves. In fact, the games are so simple, the rules for the 4 included games each fit on a single card.<br/><br/>Winning one of the Mana War games ranges from completing a grid of cards with unique rows and columns by yourself to a team effort of wit and luck to bluffing your way to be the sole winner in a cut-throat battle of memory and strategy.<br/><br/>The main goal of Mana War was to create games which are so simple to learn, a small child or a drunk person could pick it up easily. This was achieved by having incredibly simple game components and designing game rules which challenge players to think logically while only needing to remember basic colors/shapes.<br/><br/>",

These cards are dealt/picked up alongwith tickets in the same quantity and with the same 'keep/dispose' rules.There are also up to 9 bonuses for the end-of-game scoring.<br/><br/>The board does not have any grey tracks or parallel tracks - but there are spanner cards to collect which may help or hinder you.<br/><br/>There are many new options in the rules: exchange all your cards at the start but keep all the new ones: discard 5 cards and pick up 5 new ones, as your turn: earn extra points: and many more. You can also call time when your wagon stock reaches 3, if you want, giving you the advantage of stopping other players completing tickets.<br/><br/>",

        "description": "Paradox Girl is a fast-paced and dynamic card game based on the quirky, time-traveling comic book heroine of the same name. With its balanced blend of theme and abstract tactical play, Paradox Girl makes a great &quot;gateway game&quot; for 2 or 4 players, playable in about 20 minutes.<br/><br/>You don't have to know anything about the comic books or their storyline to enjoy or play the game. Paradox Girl combines mechanics like those you might find in Chrononauts, Carcassonne, and Reversi to create a kind of battle-of-wits on an ever-changing board, which offers lots of chess-like tactical thinking in a more social atmosphere. Paradox Girl is streamlined enough to be welcoming and accessible to new gamers and all general audiences, but thought provoking and dynamic enough to engage more experienced and calculating gamers.<br/><br/>The game is played on a 4&times;4 grid of cards representing possible events along a timeline/continuum. Players represent different manifestations of the same character (since the gag is that Paradox Girl frequently crosses her own timeline and interacts/fights with herself). The object of the game is to score points for yourself or to deny points to your opponents by claiming and locking down event cards on the timeline with your pawns. Unlocked events and their point values are subject to be changed every turn when players &quot;change the future&quot; (deal new cards). Control of individual spaces/cards can be contested through a very light combat mechanic called a &quot;paradox brawl.&quot; Players can also accumulate secret bonus points by snagging Waffos (tokens), Paradox Girl's favorite brand of toaster-waffles.<br/> The game is based on characters created by Cayti Bourquin and appearing in &quot;Paradox Girl&quot; by Hanako Games/Hana Comics. Artwork by Yishan Li.<br/><br/>",

The deadly virus they escaped from tags along and threatens the last few of the human race. Your goal is to survive the infection and become the individual with the best prospect for humanity's second chance.<br/><br/>13 Survivors is a micro card game with a constant state of flux. Each card can flip the outcome of the game on its head at any moment. Playing the right card at the right time is crucial for your survival.<br/><br/>The object of the game is finish each round with the best possible card (either high or lowest numbered card). A random card is removed every round, which varies the game-play and makes the outcome harder to predict. It is a game of tactics, mind-reading your opponents and a bit of luck.<br/><br/>The game is played in either 3 rounds (short game) or 7 rounds (long game). On the very first round, the oldest player goes first. On subsequent rounds, the previous round&rsquo;s winner goes first. On his turn, a player MUST play a card and do its action (unless it's his last and only card, in which case, he passes automatically), after a card&rsquo;s action is complete, it's discarded to a face-down DISCARD pile. Then it&rsquo;s the next player&rsquo;s turn clockwise. The highest-numbered card is normally the best, unless this rule is reversed when the Mathematician card is played.<br/><br/>When all players have only one card left each, they all reveal their cards simultaneously. All and any players with INFECTED cards gain NO points. SURVIVORS win points according to the numbers they end up with, and whether it&rsquo;s the highest or lowest number that wins the current round (see Mathematician card). Best-result player wins 3 points. Second best-result (if any) wins 2 points. Third best-result (if any) wins 1 point. Fourth survivor (if applicable) wins nothing. After the final round, the player with the most total points wins the game! In case of a tie for the first place, play an additional round.<br/><br/>",

Tanka is a short Japanese poem consisting of 5 lines with a structure of 5-7-5-7-7 syllables.<br/><br/>The first edition was given a restaurant theme. The cook is a bear named Goro (ゴロー） and the waiter is a rabbit named Nanako （ナナコ）. They appear in the second edition, also styled 短歌カードゲーム　ミソヒトサジ〈定食〉 （Tanka card game MISOHITOSAJI 〈Teishoku〉）, where Teishoku means &ldquo;set meal&rdquo;. The second edition enables solitaire play, whereas as the first edition rules are for 2-8 players.<br/><br/>This game enables you to easily craft Japanese Tanka poems. The game consists of cards with 5 syllable and 7 syllable words in Japanese. Mix and match the cards to create a Tanka poem following the 5-7-5-7-7 syllable structure.<br/><br/>There are six different ways to play, including &ldquo;Utaichimonme&quot; and &quot;ku-meeting&quot;. In &ldquo;Utaichimonme&quot;, players exchange cards in a manner similar to Poker in order to craft their poems. In &ldquo;ku-meeting&rdquo;, players collaborate to create a single Tanka poem.<br/><br/>In addition, the set contains 40 blank cards which you can use to write your own words to customize your game play. Because of the depth of Japanese text in the game, it would be unplayable without being able to read Japanese.<br/><br/>Publisher's summary<br/>日本の文化「短歌」を簡単に作ることができるゲームです。<br/><br/>ゲームには５文字の言葉と７文字の言葉が入っており、カードを組み合わせて、５・７・５・７・７の短歌を作ります。<br/><br/>ポーカーのようにカードを交換しながら作品を作る「うたいちもんめ」、協力プレイで全員で１首の短歌を相談しながら作る「句ミーティング（ku-meeting）」など、６つの遊び方があります。<br/><br/>また、１セットに４０枚の白紙カードがあり、自分の好きな言葉を書き込んだカードを追加してカスタマイズすることが可能です。<br/><br/>",

The other 28 cards are 7 each, of 4 different variety of plums; the Lombard, the Crugers Scarlet, the Dominee Dull, and the Green Cage Plum.  These cards display the numbers 1 to 7 in their top left corner.<br/><br/>To begin, the four Jack Horner pie cards are placed in a square.  All other cards are dealt to the players and placed faced down in a pile.  Taking turns, players flip over their top card, and attempt to add plum cards to the pies.  Once the number 1 plum card is placed on a pie, all other plum cards in ascending order must be of the same plum.<br/><br/>If a player turns over a card from his pile and he can&rsquo;t place it in the center pie cards, then he sets it in front of him face up, creating a discard pile.  He can only place a plum card if it can go in order of 1 to 7, and on the correct pie.  Once a pie is complete, the player who completes it, takes it.<br/><br/>A player may be able to play his top faced up card on his discard pile during his next turn.  He may also draw another card from his pile and play that too, if able.  After the draw cards are all used, players shuffle the discard piles and begin again until all cards have been used to create pies.<br/><br/>Score is as follows:<br/><br/>three points is awarded to the first player who goes out of cards<br/>two points for each pie taken<br/><br/>The winner is the player with the most points, or the most points after three rounds.<br/><br/>",

        "description": "A board and card abstract skirmish level combat game for 2 players depicting the battle between Asgardians and either Frost Giants, Dark Elves or Marauders.<br/><br/>Play is conducted on an 8x8 board using chits, figures or miniatures to represent units. Dependant on scenario several spaces on the board will be marked as impassable, representing pits, walls, and other obstacles.<br/><br/>Units are described in a series of tables but have a hit point value of between 1 and 9, have specific capabilities and characteristics, and may have associated special cards.<br/><br/>Players share a common deck. Cards are of varying types: Move, Ranged Attack, Hand to Hand Attack, Defence, Combo and Special.  Move and Attack cards have an associated range.<br/><br/>The units used are dependent on scenario (four are provided). Each player places one unit on each square of his back two rows. Units may not stack.<br/><br/>Players take turns with each turn comprising 3 phases:<br/><br/>1.   Fate Phase<br/>-    Draw 3 cards.  Max hand size = 5 cards.  Discard excess cards.<br/><br/>2.   Move Phase<br/>-    Play (discard) a Move card to move one of your units. The move card has a number. This is the number of spaces the unit moves. Moves can be diagonal or orthogonal. &ldquo;Knight&rdquo; type move cards allow a unit to move like a knight in chess. Instead of moving just one unit in any direction, you have the option of moving 2 or 3 units forward the indicated number of spaces using a single move card.  Units cannot move through other units.<br/><br/>3.   Fight Phase<br/>-    Play (discard) an Attack card to have a unit attack. The attack card has a number. This is the range of the attack. Attacks can be diagonal or orthogonal. &ldquo;Knight&rdquo; type attack cards produce an attack with a range like a knight in chess. Units cannot attack through other units.<br/>-    Every attack does a base of 1 damage (target loses 1 hit). Use chits or coins to record damage.  A unit reduced to 0 hits is killed or incapacitated and removed from the board. <br/>-    Your opponent may play defence cards to negate your attack.<br/>-    A unit is knocked back in the direction of the attack. If a unit is blocked by another unit the other unit is also knocked back (like a row of dominoes).  If a unit is knocked into an impassable space or off the board it is destroyed.<br/><br/>Victory conditions are scenario specific.  After 15 turns, if there is no victory, one side retreats and the battle is a draw.<br/><br/>",

        "description": "A board &amp; card skirmish level combat game for 2 players representing a battle between Tank Girl and friends vs Water and Power.<br/><br/>Play is conducted on an 8x8 grid using chits, figures or miniatures to represent units.  Terrain types (sand dunes, road, rough, impassable, destructible), which affect play, are added to the board at the players&rsquo; discretion.  Units start on the back two rows of the player&rsquo;s side of the board.  Units have a designated hit value, certain skills/characteristics and may gain specific benefits from special cards.<br/><br/>Players share a common deck.  Cards types are move, attack, defence and special.  Move and attack cards have an associated range.  Special cards have differing effects dependent on which unit they are applied to.<br/><br/>Players take turns with each turn comprising 3 phases:<br/><br/><br/>     Fate Phase<br/>         Draw 3 cards.  Max hand size = 5 cards.  Discard excess cards.<br/>    <br/>     Move Phase<br/>         Play (discard) a move card to move one of your units. The move card has a number indicating the number of spaces the unit moves. Moves can be diagonal or orthogonal. <br/>         Instead of moving just one unit in any direction, you have the option of moving 2 or 3 units forward the indicated number of spaces using a single move card. <br/>         Units cannot move through other units.<br/>    <br/>     Fight Phase<br/>         Play (discard) an attack card to have a unit attack. The attack card has a number indicating the range of the attack. Attacks can be diagonal or orthogonal. <br/>         Every attack does a base of 1 damage (target loses 1 hit). A unit reduced to 0 hits is killed or incapacitated and removed from the board.<br/>         Your opponent may play Defence cards to negate your attack.<br/>         Units cannot attack through other units.<br/>    <br/><br/><br/>The first player to knock out the opposing player&rsquo;s leaders is the winner.<br/><br/>",

        "description": "A miniatures and card game style war game played on an 8 x 8 board representing a fight between Superhero teams of the Marvel Universe. One team plays Team IRON (Iron Man, Iron Patriot, Black Widow, Spiderman, Vision and Black Panther); the other Team CAP (Captain America, Bucky, Falcon, Scarlet Witch, Hawkeye and Ant Man). Heroes start on the player&rsquo;s back row of the board. Team IRON goes first<br/><br/>A regular 52 card playing deck is used as an action deck.  Each Hero has his own action table which describes 10 numbered actions that Hero can take &ndash; these correspond to the 1 (ace) &ndash; 10 cards in the deck.  Action are of 4 types: Attack, Defence, Movement or Special.  A King card can be used to have a friendly Hero attack an adjacent enemy Hero. A Queen card can be used to move a friendly Hero 1 or 2 spaces. Black Jack cards can be used for Witty Repartee: A Friendly Hero and an enemy Hero within 2 spaces of each other may neither move nor attack the rest of this turn. Red Jack cards can be used to Taunt:  A Friendly Hero causes an enemy Hero within 2 spaces to want to attack him or her. That Hero can attack no other Heroes the rest of this or next turn.<br/><br/>First, each player fills their hand to 6 cards. Players then take turns playing 1 card at a time to cause their heroes to: Move, Attack, and Defend. Attack values indicate the range of the attack emanating from that Hero. Movement values indicate how far the Hero will move. A Defence Action will negate an attack just made by an enemy Hero against this hero. Played cards are discarded. <br/>If a player has no cards left, or nothing he wants to do, he may pass. A player who passes may play no other cards this turn except Defence cards. When both players have passed the turn ends. <br/>Heroes may not end their turns in the same space as another hero however, they may move or attack through (past) other Heroes.  <br/> Each hero has 5 Hit Points (HP). Every time a hero gets attacked and does not defend, it loses 1 HP. If a Hero is reduced to zero HP that Hero is knocked out and removed from play<br/><br/>At the end of turn 12 if both Cap and Bucky are still in play, team CAP wins, otherwise team IRON Wins.<br/><br/>",

There are two levels of play, level one using the matching letters and level two using the sounds.<br/><br/>The theme is alphabet island and the game includes a hungry shark, ready to eat all the letters.<br/><br/>To play you take turns flipping over a card and revealing a capital letter.  Then all players race to find the disc with the correspondent lower case letter, or picture/word stating with the sound of that letter.  The first person to find it gets to keep that disc and the person with the most discs at the end wins.<br/><br/>To enhance the game play there are starfish, crabs and the shark.  If you find a disc that uncovers a starfish you must give one of your discs to another player.  If you find a crab you get to take one from someone else, and if you flip over a shark card you must feed a disk to the hungry shark.  (There are four shark cards in the deck.)   The shark is a 3D plastic toy with a lever on the back that allows the shark to actually eat the disks.<br/><br/>The instructions come in English, French, Spanish and German and you could play level one in any of those languages, but to play level 2 you have to play in English.<br/><br/>",

In addition, some cards have special powers that may be activated during resolution.  In the case of &quot;ties&quot;, resolution may require succeeding card plays.

The illicit relationship of the young lovers, Tristan and Isolde, threatens to start a war with their neighbours and then there&rsquo;s the rumours about Queen Guinevere and Lancelot...<br/><br/>Players play as ambitious Lords in the time of King Arthur, all vying to be seen sat next to the most influential people in court at King Arthur&rsquo;s latest banquet at Camelot.<br/><br/>Gameplay involves playing a Scheme card from you hand that will allow your character card to move in various ways, or allows you to move the other members (King's Knights, Guests or VIPs) of the banquet.  Moving one character, however, may cause the character it displaces to also need to move in a specific way, and moves may chain beyond your control! For example, moving a Knight may require that knight to automatically move straight to the Royal Row, which may then displace a VIP such as Isolde who must move to be next to Tristan, who may then displace another Knight, etc.<br/><br/>You have until the end of the final banquet course (or &quot;round&quot;, which varies depending on chosen game length) to manoeuvre yourself into the best position to gain points from adjacent guests AND to hopefully complete your secret quest for bonus points.  The player with the most influence points wins (and becomes the most influential Lord of the land)!<br/><br/>Each game also has a random or specifically chosen common quest that changes the rules of the game slightly, which all players are affected by.<br/><br/>When playing with less than 4 players, AI players called &quot;Rogue Nobles&quot; operate the &quot;missing&quot; players, moving around automatically and likely screwing up your well laid plans!<br/><br/>",

        "description": "Introduction<br/><br/>The game is a cooperative, 1 to 6 players, settled in the Elements Realities universe, a concept by Giortech GmbH.<br/><br/>In the game, the players are Temporal Agents, in a Time Agency set in the near future, that jump in time for dangerous missions in the past, in the ancient Greece.<br/>The agents must protect the Timeline and preserve the Reality from the attacks of a mysterious force only known as... Darklings! All the wonderful discoveries of the ancient Greece, the democracy, the philosophy, the arts, the sciences, are at risk. The Agents jump in the middle of the most important key events of the mankind to protect the Reality.<br/><br/>Produced at LudoFact, this made in Germany game is presented in German Version. English Version is coming shortly.<br/><br/>The Game mechanics of Elements Realities<br/><br/>The game is cooperative as all the agents have to fulfill dangerous missions in the past to protect our Reality from the attacks of the treacherous and mysterious Darklings.<br/>Each player chooses an Agent with specific unique skills. Then, each agent chooses a mission card among the currently available in the Agency, and starts the jump procedures: First a briefing card is executed, and then the jump is done on the Time Jump Track with a dice roll, based on the time distance in epoch to jump back. If the jump is missed, then a roll is made on the Jump Failure Track, where the Agent can influence the result by spending his own Reality Chits (the &quot;coins&quot; of the game). When an Agent manages to jump successfully into the past, the Mission story is built. The mechanism of building the mission is so that it is almost impossible to build the same mission twice. Every mission card has objectives on the bottom, and a sequence of Events cards is extracted, each containing one or more objectives symbols, until all the missions goals are paid off. A certain number of Reality Chits are positioned on the Mission card, as final reward. The Agent then each turn faces one Event card that can be passed by successfully rolling against some of the personal skills. Every Event passed shall make gain or lose Reality Chits on the Mission card. If at any moment the number of Chits should go less than zero, the Mission is lost and the Agent is transferred back to the Agency, where can start a new Mission. Every lost Mission reduces by 1 the level of our Reality. Every successful Mission increases the level by 1. Goal of the game is to reach level 10. When all Agents have moved in a round, before the next, there come the Darklings. An Agent per turn possesses the Destiny in his hands, a special white wooden Chit. Whoever owns the Destiny faces the Darklings in that round. A Time Epoch is moved forward, a Reality Chit is given to the Agency from the bank, and a Darklings card is extracted and positioned on the board. If the Darklings card has the same symbol of the current Epoch (circle, triangle or square) then the card comes into effect, and the negative effects are executed. Before that, the owner of the Destiny can decide to roll against the Darklings cards as many dices as many Reality Chits of the Agency is willing to pay. The roll is made against the current Reality Level, so if the Agents are losing the game it will become increasingly more difficult, and if they are winning it will become easier. For every successful roll, a Darklings card of choice can be removed and the positive effect on it is executed. Then a new round starts.<br/><br/>One of the most interesting aspects of the game is its configurability. The difficulty level is based on the starting level chosen for our Reality and the Darklings Reality. This amounts to almost 100 difficulty levels to choose from, in a 2D space of difficulties. Elements Realities will never become obsolete! Then the Game is unique in that an Agent can join the game in every moment, and can leave in any moment. No more uh-uh moments when a friend knocks at the door and you are already in a one hour game. Just offer a chair and an Agent card. The same if someone has to leave or pause the participation during a game. This *is* freedom!<br/><br/>The Game of Elements Realities has many facets: family game, strategy choices, roll of dices, collaboration between players, deep immersive story. The presence of Special Missions that build exciting Side Stories that span for multiple Mission cards, give the game an uncommon depth. The Agents, the Stories, the entire World of Elements Realities, are depicted in the Science Fiction Novels that are regularly published. An entire Universe comes to life. Giortech shall also produce a first pilot episode of a series.<br/><br/> A final note from the Author <br/><br/>I want to make a special note, at the end of this presentation of Elements Realities, to put under light the fact that the Missions presented in the game, and the surrounding stories, happen in the real Greek history. By playing the game, you will learn important events that forged the world in which we live, and the dates in which these events happened. So the Edutainment aspect is great and unique.<br/>Last, but not least, I leave you with a thought. There is a deep analogy between our lives and the Universe of Elements Realities. As the Agents jump in Time to protect the great discoveries of the ancient Greece, the Philosophy, the Arts, the Democracy, so everyone of us, in our today time, must not take for granted once and for all terms like Culture, Arts, Democracy, but we have to nurture them every day a little.<br/><br/>Each of us is a Time Agent, in our time.<br/><br/>&mdash;description from the publisher<br/><br/>",

Get the most unicards by matching mane color, hoof color, and horn color to the unicard you wish.<br/><br/>Players have a hand of 5 cards. Most cards have a unicorn on them with a colored mane, hooves, or horn in one of the 7 colors of the rainbow. Cards are also marked with a shape to help differentiate colors and for help with the colorblind.<br/><br/>During a turn, a player draws a card from the top of the deck or the discard pile. Once a player has three matching color unicorn cards of all three types (hooves, horn, and mane) they may discard all three and claim that color Unicard.<br/><br/>Unicards are separate from the cards used in the deck and player hands. There are 7 Unicards, one for each of the colors of the rainbow, and the first player to claim 4 Unicards wins the game. But be careful, because other players can steal your UniCards by also matching the same colors.<br/><br/>Also included are rainbow unicorns that can be used as any color and the dark horse which prevents you from winning.<br/><br/>&mdash;user summary<br/><br/>",

You play adventurers chasing after the precious scales of the Star Dragon; the game is semi-cooperative, with a pure coop mode for 2-3 players and a more competitive mode with the potential for betrayal for 3-4 players.<br/><br/>Each turn has three phases. In the preparation phase, you can spend Stars to buy items or heal, and you choose an item to use in the combat phase. In the combat phase, you flip a card from the Star Dragon deck and resolve its attack. Only the players with the highest attack or defense rating take part in combat. If things go well you can earn Stars here, but if they poorly some players will take damage. Some Dragon cards also have special effects like doing damage to players with too many Stars. Finally, in the Spoils phase the Stars earned in combat are split evenly among all participants. The game ends after ten turns, when the Dragon's Crown is revealed.<br/><br/>Because Stars are used to heal damage as well as to buy the items you attack with every turn, you'll have to balance offense and defence in order to survive the dragon's attacks. If you're playing to win you can play it safe in a round by trying to avoid combat... but since you won't get a share of the spoils that's risky too. You'll need balance in how you deal with the Dragon as well as your allies to come out ahead.<br/><br/>&mdash;user summary<br/><br/>",

The game allows you to use your own characters from your system of choice and play mini-adventures. <br/>In this game, everyone gets the opportunity to play, and everyone gets the opportunity to GM. It's a rule-lite game that builds player confidence with d20 RPG systems and encourages skills and experience with GMing.<br/><br/>The Game-play:<br/><br/>Players: 2-6 (but can stretch to 8 depending on the mode)<br/>Playtime: 30-180min (dependant on how much players like to roleplay)<br/><br/>The game is formed primarily of:<br/>Quest cards, hunt cards, location cards, a set of meeples, and a set of dice. The quest/hunt cards have plot-hooks written on the front and GM notes on the back. The location cards are drawn when the players are resting in the town after a hard day adventuring; the cards contain a mixture of bonuses and setbacks.<br/><br/>The game has three primary modes of play, head-to-head, co-operative, and classic. <br/>In head-to-head, 1-4 players build a party of four adventurers and compete with each other to become the most successful/famous party in the land. Players move from town-to-town, completing quests and trying to earn: coin, renown, and experience points.<br/>In co-operative mode, 3-6 players choose a character and join forces to form a party. The players head to a local town and aim to clear the board of quests within 5 days. <br/>In classic mode, 2-6 players choose characters to form a party and compete with a GMs rival party of adventurers.<br/><br/>Applications as a tool:<br/>The game was originally designed to be used as a prop during DND. The game can be used to manage downtime or as a way to introduce the party during session zero. It can also be used to generate plot-hooks or side-quests during the game. <br/>The game itself is a great way to pass the time while you are waiting for other players to show up or as an alternative when players unexpectedly cancel.<br/><br/>&mdash;description from the publisher<br/><br/>",

Those who choose unwisely will fall into the sea and be lost forever!<br/><br/>All is not lost, however.  Boreas, the wind god, has taken pity on the doomed Atlanteans and has pledged to save the most worthy of you.  Whoever can survive to the end will be swept up by Boreas and carried to safety.  Do you have what it takes to outsmart your opponents and live to tell the tale?<br/><br/>Doomsday is a card game that integrates with a mobile app to create a fun, light-hearted party game. It is a social-deduction game of bluffing, persuasion, back stabbing and reading your opponents.  Each round, players simultaneously select a location card from their hand to travel to.  If too many people travel to the same location, the mobile app will eliminate some of them.<br/><br/>Location cards have special abilities that may modify the usual flow of the game, but play will continue until there are two players left who face off in a showdown.  Depending on their choices, there may be one winner, two winners, or they may both lose!  Games are quick and designed to be played multiple times in succession.<br/><br/>&mdash;description from the publisher<br/><br/>",

The tunnel has eleven event fields whose meaning should read aloud.<br/><br/>At the beginning the player rolls the dice and tries to roll a 4. On the cube it is the highest number, in addition there is a rock and a pic. So who dices the 4 may dig and is then right again at the turn.<br/><br/>If you roll a boulder, it means that there is a rockfall. Then you take a boulder and put it right in front of your field. You only pass the rock by rolling a pic. Even if the next moles arrive and might even pass by with their litter, they have to wait in front of the boulder.<br/><br/>So if one of the moles manages to roll a pimple, the rock is knocked out and the player is allowed to roll the dice again.<br/><br/>The event fields have different meanings. They can be to the advantage, but also to the detriment. Most of the events are negative and slow the mole down a bit. The events are really very sweet written and lovingly illustrated.<br/><br/>The winner is the first to reach the finish with the exact number of points.<br/><br/>&mdash;user summary<br/><br/>",

When opponents land on players owned property, the owning player collects rent from the landing player.

The ultimate goal is to have the most money and drive opponents into bankruptcy.<br/><br/>From the rear of the box:<br/>Welcome to the Unite Students edition of Monopoly.

Fun for everyone!<br/><br/>&mdash;description from the publisher (translated)<br/><br/>Game play: If there is no own Popeye on the board, one is placed on the tee-off field. The active player rolls with both dice.  Each rolled double (2x equal number) now causes the checkered flag to be moved. The rolled number shows where (new target field).<br/><br/>The active player always rolls again after a double. Both rolled results can be used for the movement of figures. At least 1 movement has to be done on a player&rsquo;s turn. A figure movement takes place with your own Popeye, Olivia, or Brutus.<br/><br/>The rolled numbers 1 to 6 show the possible range of movement on the board. The player will always have 3 possible results after rolling both dice.<br/><br/>Popeye (-balls) are immediately holed when 1 Popeye moves to the checkered flag field with the last step of his current movement (the target field of a movement).<br/><br/>Oliva helps / Repositions Popeye: The coaster on which the Oliva token is currently lying is relevant here.

From the time of Napoleon through to the trenches of World War One and right up to special forces operations in the early 21st century. A small team dropped in against the odds. Doom Squad is meant to be played as a solo game system pitting your team against the game engine. You can also opt for a multi-player game of 'co-operation' of two or several players going up against the game.<br/><br/>Your troops will be equipped with the latest high-tech weapons and equipment from their historical or current era; which can mean muskets, rifled carbines or assault carbines with red-dot sights. It all depends on which period you pick. Rules are very simple and easy to use and are based around the use of one or more six sided dice to test for firing and close combat. Players will control one or more special forces squads and will be faced with an enemy that can be tough, disciplined, confused, resolute, unsteady and always unpredictable.<br/><br/>&mdash;description from the publisher<br/><br/>",

Unfortunately I don't think either of these games are up to the quality I want to maintain with CSL so both will no longer be available on our catalog.<br/><br/>If you purchased 1968 and/or 1987, I will provide you with a 20$ discount toward your next purchase.<br/><br/>Finally, I apologize that these games ended up being broken.<br/><br/>&mdash;description from the publisher<br/><br/>The 4th title in the Procedural Combat Series (PCS) allows players to recreate the infamous Vietnamese Tet Offensive across Vietnam. PCS is uniquely suited to simulate the conflict given the variable combat strength system being an elegant way of representing asymmetric and conventional warfare on a number of levels.<br/><br/>1968 is arguably the first game in the series to give a player a significant chance of winning through an Automatic Victory. The Vietnamese player is incentivized to string a series of rope-a-dope attacks together forcing the American player to constantly react or recover instead of operating offensively. The American player while having advanced weaponry, fantastic air power, and well-trained units, they lack strategic objectivity making it more difficult to turn success into political consequences/VP.<br/><br/>Random events can play a key role in changing the pacing of the game; like ending a turn prematurely, allowing several spent units to refresh or even exchange combat chits. The Vietnamese player receives material support through the USSR and nuances regarding supply/logistics allow the Vietnamese player a level of strategic and operational flexibility unavailable to the American units, at the exchange of raw power.<br/><br/>WEIGHT: 7/10<br/>SOLITAIRE: 9/10<br/>PLAYERS: 1-2<br/><br/>&mdash;description from the designer<br/><br/>",

You'll need to avoid fruitless battles and use your skills to your advantage to get the most treasure.<br/><br/>Of course each character has something that makes them different, whether that's the Robot who can plan ahead for battles, the Black Cat who can go not just up or down but anywhere, the Professor who gets an extra boost in discoveries, or any of the other characters.<br/><br/>Will you come back with the riches of Potu?<br/><br/>&mdash;description from the publisher<br/><br/>",

The wizard wins if 4 wizards appear or change all labyrinths into a mirror world. Compete which is faster.<br/><br/>◆ ◆ The appeal of the game ◆ ◆<br/><br/>Adventurers can either move or flip the labyrinth tile. The number of actions is determined by the dice, but there is little difference. However, if the numbers are biased continuously, it can make a big difference. Enjoy your luck!<br/><br/>The game system on the adventurer's side is a mix of whack-a-mole, which defeats so many wizards, and treasure hunt looking for weapons. I want to search for weapons quickly, but I can't get used to it because there are so many wizards.<br/><br/>The wizard will win if 4 witches appear, trap the adventurers in the mirror labyrinth! But wizards are so weak that an adventurer can be killed just by passing. Get up again and again!<br/><br/>Adventurers can flip the labyrinth tiles upside down like a mirror. Adventurers can make a path by flipping the labyrinth tiles, even if the road you want to go is blocked. Ofcourse you can flip the labyrinth tiles to keep the dragon away. The wizard will win if all the labyrinth tiles change the mirror world, so let's turn it over.<br/><br/>Dragons that are a threat to adventurers and wizards move randomly according to the cards. The plan can be ruined by the dragon. However, adventurers can restart from the magic square even if they are attacked by dragons, so don't give up until the end!<br/><br/>&mdash;description from the publisher<br/><br/>",

There is one general rule; the more players there are, the more cards are required.<br/><br/>The game starts with cards being dealt so that each player receives the same amount. Starting from the first, players lay down cards in such a way that everyone can see the card. Having laid the card, the player has to perform a certain action established before starting the game, and corresponding to the suit and rank of the card. Some suits or ranks require that the player perform no action.<br/><br/>Player who perform the wrong action, or fail to perform one when required, is obliged to take the pile of cards.<br/><br/>The winner of each round attributes a way of acting to other cards in the next round, but the actions for queens, kings and aces remains the same.<br/><br/>The first player to empty their hand wins the game.<br/><br/>",

The original game was created by Ms. Lenhardt Kwaysser Fatime, winner of the 2020 Super Teacher Award, during her quarantine for her own class, and was later further developed with the help of the Blue Game. The year 2020 has left us with a lot of bad feelings and memories, but it is important that we can laugh despite the difficulties.<br/><br/>The goal of the game, which can be played by 2-6 people, is to preserve our cold blood and overcome the obstacles in front of us in the constantly changing conditions. Collect all 19 points! During the game, they could step on a special game board that could change at any moment, creating a whole new situation for the players. When collecting points, don't forget about the mask and hand sanitizer! Funny quarantine cards will help or hinder us during our mission.<br/><br/>If we come together from time to time to defeat the virus together, we can also play with the semi-cooperative game mode: here too we collect points for ourselves, but in the meantime we also have to pay close attention to the threatening virus so that it does not outgrow us! We can only defeat it by working together together if we are willing to make sacrifices and give up the points we have already earned. In the game, we tried to smuggle a lot of humor in addition to the current problems, to solve the limitations and annoyances of everyday life.<br/><br/>Masks produced, have fun!<br/><br/>&mdash;description from the publisher (translated)<br/><br/>",

One of the players deals one card each.  Each player looks at the card and reveals it, placing it straight (not oblique) in front of him (attention: once positioned it must not be moved until the end of the game).  The player whose turn it is then takes the top card of the deck and places it face down in the center of the table: this is the bank card.  He then reads the quiz on the new top card of the deck and turns over the dealer card.  The goal of each competitor is to conquer the bank card just discovered, solving the quiz indicated on the top card of the deck before the others.  The quizzes are expressed in such a way that each player must find a correspondence between a figure on his card and a figure on the bank card (see example).  The first to find the right figures takes the dealer card (you have to be quick!) and shows the correct match.  A competitor may take the dealer card even if he believes that between his card and the dealer card there is no correspondence required by the quiz card.  In this case he declares: &quot;None!&quot;  We then proceed to check: if the player has made the right observation, he wins the bank card;  otherwise he leaves the game and cannot re-enter until the end of the game.  The game continues in the same way, changing the dealer every turn.<br/><br/>Whoever has the most cards when the deck runs out wins.  Attention: the player who leaves the game keeps the cards won, which are counted in his final score.<br/><br/>",

Once some Heroes have been transformed, Nom Nom Nom! allows the Krampus to heal whenever he destroys a Naughtie.<br/><br/>The first action available to Krampus is Into The Bag. This devastating attack renders the target Immobile and Hexed, making its next activation difficult as it struggles to move or attack (it&rsquo;s hard to move when you&rsquo;re stuck in a sac, after all).<br/><br/>The next action is the Grabbing Stick, which allows Krampus to move the target with compel, potentially setting it up to perform an attack for the Consul because with the final action, Make Mischief, the Krampus can force the Heroes to attack each other if they have been turned into Naughties!<br/><br/>The Krampus's Boss Fight card help's ensure that at least one Hero will always suffer the fate of being transformed into a Naughtie thanks to Caught Red Handed. This ability also provides a fun interaction with Kringle's own Nice List ability.

Think of it like a series of short boxing matches, but with less punching. Usually.&quot;<br/><br/>Players are dealt the cards per the Set-up.  One player designated as a judge flips over a blue care with a &quot;Judgement&quot; on it.  Players then play green cards as fast as possible as only the first two played are accepted by the judge.  Players then argue their card choices to the judge who may then ask for a red &quot;Modifier&quot; card to be played by the chosen players.  The judge makes a final ruling on whose cards best describe the blue card played.  The winner is awarded the blue card. The role of &quot;Judge&quot; for the next round is awarded to the winner.  After a predetermined number of rounds by the players, the player with the most blue cards is the winner.<br/><br/>",

Each card in hand gives players 2 choices of conditions to add to the conditions on the word stax in play. The more conditions, the more the stax are worth. If they can think of a word or phrase that fits all the conditions, they can claim the stack and all its points&hellip;for now! Players are aided by special cards which allow them to manipulate the stax and claim them for their own!<br/><br/>GAMEPLAY<br/><br/>5 cards are laid on the table representing the intitial stax (7 for a 3 or 4 player game), and each player holds 3 cards and 5 cubes in their hands. On a turn, a player places a card such that one additional condition is added to the stack. The player says a word that fits all the conditions of the stack and claims it for their own by placing a cube on the stack, then draws a new card. Claimed stacks can be claimed by other players if they can add a card to the stack. Special cards allow players to perform other actions such as swap, remove, or rotate cards. If a player cannot play on a stack, they discard a card from their hand and lose a cube permanently. When all players have either run out of cubes or cards to play, the game ends and each player recieves points for their claimed stax.<br/><br/>Word Stax was an entry in the 2021 54-Card Game Contest, where it placed 4th for best solitaire game, and 6th overall.<br/><br/>",

Each player starts with one colony ship pawn and 30 planets stones. Players share 169 double-sided control tiles and 60 contested tiles.<br/><br/>On a turn, a player must move his or her ship pawn one or more hexes, in any one of the six standard directions, to any hex not containing any stone or the opponent's pawn. Pawns may pass over any hexes not containing an opponent's stone or pawn. Pawns can pass over owned stones. Control tiles never impede movement and simply indicate ownership of a hex.<br/><br/>When a pawn reaches its destination hex, the player may place a control tile and an owned stone on top in any one of the empty hexes adjacent to the pawn that is not adjacent to any other stone.<br/><br/>For each hex adjacent to a placed stone, if the hex is not adjacent to any opponent stone, place a control tile own-side up in the hex; and if the hex has one or more adjacent opponent stones, replace the opponent&rsquo;s control tile with a contested tile.<br/><br/>The game ends when all hexes contain a control or contested tile.

Players want to build up the best sharks to attack either land, sea, or air enemies, never fully knowing which locations the enemy cards belong to played by your opponents.<br/><br/>On your turn, you can either call for &ldquo;Sharkmageddon&rdquo; or decide to draw cards. Card draws help the player boost their sharks by adding body parts, or hurt players by adding enemy &ldquo;human&rdquo; cards facedown.<br/><br/>Sharks are divided into land, sea, and air depending on the color of their heads. The sharks battle the enemy cards of that same type. Any player can begin &quot;Sharkmageddon&quot; at the beginning of their turn, but only the shark with the highest combat power can challenge the enemy and earn points for that location. When &ldquo;Sharkmageddon&rdquo; begins, player compare attack power of their sharks by location. An &ldquo;air&rdquo; shark has no relation to a &ldquo;sea&rdquo; shark and do not cancel each other.<br/><br/>From here, all enemy cards played are revealed and placed in their different locations. The feeding frenzy begins, the strongest shark for each location attacks the enemies. If the fighting power is greater than the enemies` collective power, the player collects the cards and earns those points. If the strongest shark is weaker than the enemies, the shark is wasted! All sharks used for that &ldquo;Sharkmagedon&rdquo; attack are discarded.<br/><br/>When the deck runs out, the player with the most points wins.<br/><br/>",

        "description": "Escalation: Nuclear War in Europe is a comic-book-styled game of espionage, warfare, and nuclear exchange. It is a game for 1-2 players, which begins its story at the height of the Cold War. You take the role of NATO or Warsaw Pact commander-in-chief.<br/><br/>Each turn, you start with a set of action cards, which you use to perform actions and trigger events. Your successes bring you closer to victory but escalate the crisis at the same time. The initial Cold War stage allows you to use agents to perform intelligence operations. But when the game escalates to the next (Conventional War) stage, the full force of the army and airforce is brought to bear.<br/><br/>Now you conduct military offensives by advancing your armies across the enemy land, supported by your bombers and agents. If you gain a lot of ground quickly, the enemy falls apart, and you are victorious. But if you fail to sustain the advance, another escalation becomes imminent, crossing the threshold into a nuclear war.<br/><br/>The game comes with a Tutorial designed to teach you the game quickly and easily. You can play the full or the short version of the game, giving 2-4 hours of average gameplay time. It also features a Solo Bot system specially developed for this game. This is the first in a series of games that are quick to learn, easy to play, and exciting to experience. Special attention has been given to the system's user-friendliness and visual style.<br/><br/>&mdash;description from the designer<br/><br/>",

        "description": "Conspicuous Cultists is a Lovecraft inspired, pocket sized, solitaire game of resource management, cult building, and Eldritch secret seeking. <br/>You'll shuffle up a deck of randomly selected event cards that will be slightly different every time you play. Will you uncover dark secrets and hidden knowledge, or will your dark obsession get the best of you!<br/><br/>To set up a game of Conspicuous Cultists you'll make a semi-random deck of 14 cards from the 43 present in the game box. You'll pick a starting resource pool, and then you can begin. The resources are divided into 5 types: Relics, Money, Cultists, Persons of Interest, and Suspicion. You then will reveal cards from the top of the deck and pick one of the two to three options available on the card. This will cause you to do things like pay or gather resources, remove the card from your deck, add new cards to your deck, or roll a dice to see what might happen. <br/>Some of the cards will lead you through a chain of events (by adding new cards to your deck) that will ultimately allow you to unlock a dark secret, such as a pact with the Deep Ones.<br/><br/>When you get all the way through your deck, you'll shuffle it and keep going. This means that part of the challenge of the game is remembering which trials and obstacles are in your deck that you haven't come across yet, so you can try to save your resources for them. Or alternatively gambling that you'll be able to replenish your resources before you encounter those trials. You may remember the cards in your deck, but you'll never know what order they'll come up.<br/><br/>You'll also have to balance your resource income and expenditures. Too many resources and the gods may curse you for your gluttony. Too much suspicion and law enforcement may raid your cult. But too little of anything, and you won't be prepared for what comes next. As bad as a curse of greed or a law enforcement raid may be, the wrath that the Old Ones pour out upon those who approach their secrets unprepared can be far worse!<br/><br/>&mdash;description from the designer<br/><br/>",

With one of them, the penguins push and shove themselves across ice fields and dive from floe to floe. The other die drives schools of fish towards them, but also allows the penguin friend Walli Walfisch to appear. This causes pieces to come loose from the floes every now and then, and a penguin goes swimming. A slide leads out of the icy water and back onto the ice, ending in two landing areas: In one of them, fish can be collected here, but in the other one, some fish can also slip out of the fins and then lie ready for penguins to slide in later.<br/>Whoever collects the most fish in this cheerful Antarctic adventure wins.<br/><br/>&mdash;description from the publisher<br/><br/>",

It has several play modes:<br/><br/>1. Crosswords: One player rolls all 13 dice and forms words in a crossword puzzle shape. Players agree on the length of the round (between 2-5 minutes) and the number of rounds before the start of the game. Letters used score their point value. Letters used in two words score for both words. Letters not used are subtracted from the score.<br/><br/>When a player finishes making words, players can try to make a funny sentence with the words.<br/><br/>2. Letter Yatzi: The first player rolls all 13 dice and tries to form the longest word. Letters which don't fit are rolled again. At least one letter must be put aside each time. Play continues until all letters are used or set aside. Points are scored for the letters used. Unused letters are not counted.<br/><br/>If a player uses all 13 letters, the score for the word is doubled.<br/><br/>3. Vocabulary: All players together make one word, with all 13 dice if possible. One player is chosen as the secretary. Players try to make words with the letters of the first word, and the secretary keeps track of them. The winner is the player who can find the last intelligible word.<br/><br/>",

On each of the six nights of the game, each player guides two groups, but every group has a different number of members and cargo value, as well as different points of departure and arrival. So movement must be planned and sometimes a group must be sacrifice in order to save other. The length of each group's journey, the value of its cargo and the phase of the moon influences the strategy as for example, on a full moon, the officers can better see and thus control the territory. Also there are different terrains like forests, unpredictable and dangerous lookout points, mounts and a canyon river (the Douro, famous for the Port wine) influence the movement and hiding capacities of the smugglers. The action cards add different dynamics to the game allowing to momentarily break the rules and get a flavor of the tactics of both smugglers and officers.<br/><br/>&quot;Night is falling. Amidst the silence and shadows of the villages, men and women leave their homes with suspicious bags. Walking for hours and hours, they cross mounts and valleys, smuggling merchandise to Spain. But the portuguese border force officers know the paths and are always on the lookout for the nightly adventurers. This game, based on the heritage of Territ&oacute;rios do C&ocirc;a relives the smuggling stories from the period of the portuguese dictatorship. Can you get to Spain?&rdquo;<br/><br/>",

Each player has six swimmer cards, three &quot;rascals&quot; who want to cannonball other swimmers and three divers. The pool is seeded with one swimmer during set-up.<br/><br/>On a turn, a player chooses one swimmer card and decides whether to take a normal jump or a special jump. For the normal jump, the player stands, holds the card at eye level, then drops it onto the playing area. A diver scores points if it touches no other swimmer cards, with more points being awarded if the diver jumps later in the game. A rascal must try to &quot;splash&quot; a swimmer identified by the player's left-hand neighbor. If the rascal doesn't touch this card, the player scores no points; if it does, the player scores 1-3 points depending on how successful the splash is.<br/><br/>For a special jump, the player must hold the card over the head (for a diver) or toss the card while sitting (for a rascal). If a swimmer card touches the edge of the pool or falls completely outside the pool, the player loses 1-2 points.<br/><br/>The player with the most points after everyone's had a turn in the pool wins.<br/><br/>",

The players roll a larger die and move their marker about the tiles, rotating the one they laid on clockwise. When 4 tiles are made to point together, the player scores a point and 5 points wins.

Jovima the Mage is master of this mystical land. His many wonderful Treasures lie waiting throughout his realm, each guarded by a perilous adversary of unique powers. Jovima challenges each wayfarer to dare the Trial by Pylon, a trial in which you risk your very life to attain some of his wealth and powers.<br/><br/>Whether you are a Novice, a Warrior, or a Sorcerer, the elements of chance are always testing your skills. A simple treasure hunt can easily become a fight for survival. Up to six players may confront Jovima in their quest for fortune.<br/><br/>&mdash;publisher description<br/><br/>An independently produced hack-and-slash fantasy card game. Per the rulebook, the first edition was limited to 5000 numbered copies. Some or all of these first edition copies were signed by the designer and artists. It does not appear any subsequent editions were published.<br/><br/>Three &quot;levels&quot; of play are available: Novice, Warrior, and Sorcerer. The Novice level is a solitaire game that allows a player to become familiarized with the Location, Weapon, Treasure, and Peril (monster) cards. Warrior level challenges the players to be the one who escapes the realm with the greatest amount of treasure. To win at the Sorcerer level, a player must exit the realm with Jovima's four most precious treasures, thereby becoming an Adept at the Trial by Pylon.<br/><br/>The game includes six characters, each of which has a special points advantage in regards to some or all of the &quot;Perils&quot; that will be encountered in the realm. Players switch to a different character if the one the player started with is killed off.<br/><br/>Character, Weapon, Location, and Peril cards are randomly distributed at start, and during the game by drawing from the respective decks. Players use their character's special advantage, along with weapons possessed by the character, to overcome the peril found at a location in order to win the treasure being guarded by the peril. Combat is a straight comparison of the Power number for the weapon used by the character, plus any character bonuses, against the Strength value of the Peril card, adjusted for the Location when applicable (classes of monsters are stronger when in certain locations, or sometimes weaker). The Weapon card is discarded after use.<br/><br/>Treasures can be used to buy weapons, and sometimes to bribe a peril. Escape cards allow a player to successfully avoid a peril, or perhaps end the Trial by Pylon - but beware the appearance of Jovima, who can bring your quest to a sudden conclusion!<br/><br/>Trial by Pylon is not solely a dungeon-crawling adventure. The locations depicted on the cards range from wilderness venues, to rooms that might be found in a palace or castle, to elements of a cavern or dungeon complex - making the journey a varied, abstracted, and somewhat random one!<br/><br/>&mdash;user summary<br/><br/>",

        "description": "During the occupation of France by Nazi Germany, many brave men and women risked everything they had to continue fighting against fascism. Today, we know that the Resistance and the Allies would be victorious, but at that time - living moment-to-moment - it was far from inevitable. They are celebrated not because they won, but because they stood firm when the outcome was uncertain and dangerous.<br/><br/>There were others - often the wealthy and powerful - who stood for nothing, who risked nothing. The sorts of people who only do the right thing when it is safe and profitable for them to do so, who don't care what side they're on, so long as they're not on the losing side. Throughout the occupation, they attempted a delicate balancing act, collaborating with the Germans while also helping the Resistance, allowing them to hedge their bets until the last possible moment, switching to the winning side so as to escape its wrath.<br/><br/>These are the sorts of people that players are asked to play in Streets of Shadows. Not the brave heroes of the Resistance, nor even the scared everyday people just trying to get by, but the sorts of people who see the occupation as an opportunity for advancement - as a way to pursue economic, social, and political influence. The game does not ask you to empathize with these unsavory people, but does seek to demonstrate how they enable oppressive power structures to remain in place. Even today, even on the other side of an ocean, there are still those who risk everything to fight for a better world, and others who remain silent, safe, comfortable, and complicit.<br/><br/>&mdash;description from the publisher<br/><br/>",

If a player rolls 3 of a kind, they may take a guess of any player as the spy that is on the three dice. If a player rolls five of a kind, they may either guess a player as any spy, or they may take a big chance and try to accomplish their mission. To accomplish their mission, the player that rolled the 5 of a kind must ask each player in a clockwise manner if they want to guess him as the spy identity on the dice. If no player is willing to make a guess and the player is the spy on the dice, that player has accomplished his mission and wins the game. Otherwise, the last player remaining in the game is the winner.<br/><br/>",

        "description": "In the abandoned and uncharted spaces of the solar system a small group of daredevil pilots fly their spacecraft through dangerous race courses known as Circuits. Set up in advance by a shadowy group of scouts and bookies, each Circuit is unique. Some wind through planetary canyons, others through old mining tunnels bored through asteroids or through the swirling rocks of planetary rings. Racers must dodge obstacles as well as the weapons fire of their opponents to cross the finish line first to win fame and fortune!<br/><br/>Solar Circuit Racing is a sci-fi racing game for 2-6 players. The game is played on a modular, customizable course made out of map tiles. Moving into a tile with an obstacle requires a piloting roll. Failing the piloting roll results in something bad happening, like smashing into an asteroid or scraping a wing along a canyon wall. Damage reduces the capabilities of your ship. Once you pass the roll, you can advance into the space and move on.<br/><br/>Each turn, you will have to manage your limited engine power, and make decisions about how to spend it. Engine power can be used to advance through the course, to evade enemy weapons, and to make maneuvering through obstacles easier. Spend too much power on maneuvering and your opponents will jump into the lead, too much on advancing and you'll splatter against the obstacles. The first player to complete the decided on number of laps wins.<br/><br/>",

Will Gandalf's reappearance at Fangorn help in their epic struggle and, even if The Fellowship and its allies repel the attack of the Warg Riders on the Plains of Rohan and then successfully destroy Isengard, will the huge battle at Helm&rsquo;s Deep prove too much? The resolve and determination of Mordor remains undiminished as it struggles to regain the ultimate power and it will stop at nothing in its quest to defeat The Fellowship.<br/><br/>Skill, strategy and luck will play their part in your success or failure and, whether you choose to play good or evil, there will be no respite and no place to hide &ndash; The One Ring must be destroyed if Middle-earth is to survive.<br/><br/>",

If a player can not use a card, he simply passes the turn and waits for the result of the round.<br/><br/>At the end of the round if there are active attack cards, each player will receive a damage card for each attack card on the table, except the last player to play a card.<br/><br/>The player who scores nine points with damage cards loses the round and is eliminated from the game, the last player standing wins the game.<br/><br/><br/>",

Learn shapes, colors, animals, beginning letter sounds, counting and addition!<br/><br/>Object: Be the first player to shout &quot;BINGO&quot; by getting 4-in-a-row.<br/><br/>Game One: Color/Shape Match<br/>Use the spinner, and cards with shapes on them. The youngest player begins by spinning the spinner and calling out the shape and color to which the arrow points. For example, &quot;Blue Star!&quot;. Then all players search their cards for that color and shape. If they have a match, they cover it with a Tad bingo chip. Play continues clockwise with each player taking a turn spinning and calling. For shorter games, just match colors or just match shapes.<br/><br/>Game Two: Number Match<br/>Use the spinner, and cards with numbers on them. The youngest player begins by spinning the spinner and calling out the number to which the arrow points. For example, &quot;number 9!&quot;. Then all players search their cards for that number. If they have a match, they cover it with a Tad bingo chip. Play continues clockwise with each player taking a turn spinning and calling.<br/><br/>Game Three: Animal Match<br/>Use the spinner, and cards with animals on them. The youngest player begins by spinning the spinner and calling out the animal and color to which the arrow points. For example, &quot;Purple Lion!&quot;. Then all players search their cards for that color and animal. If they have a match, they cover it with a Tad bingo chip. Play continues clockwise with each player taking a turn spinning and calling. For shorter games, just match animals. Or for a beginning letter challenge, instead of announcing the animal the caller says &quot;the animal that begins with M&quot;. Players then place Tad bingo chips on ALL animals on their cards that begin with M.<br/><br/>Game Four: Add-Up and Match<br/>Use the spinner with the addition equations, and cards with numbers on them. The youngest player begins by spinning the spinner and solves the equation to which the arrow points and calls out the answer. For example, if the spinner points to 9+1, then the player solves it and calls out 10. Then all players search for 10 and cover it with a Tad bingo chip. Play continues clockwise with each player taking a turn spinning and calling.<br/><br/>Winning:<br/>A player wins when they get 4 Tad bingo chips in a horizontal, vertical, or diagonal row and they shout out &quot;bingo&quot;.<br/><br/>",

You win if you will find all 16 clues/witness, before the ending of last turn.<br/><br/>Co-operative and very random game. Good to play with kids.<br/><br/>",

The object of the game is to collect cards with birds on them. the winner is the player who has the most birds when the game ends.<br/><br/>To set up the game, all the cards are shuffled together and placed face down on the table. Players take it in turns to draw a card<br/><br/>There are three types of cards in the deck:<br/><br/>Most of the cards in the deck are Bird cards which have a picture of one to six birds on them. When a Bird card is drawn, the player puts it on the table in front of them.<br/><br/>Scaredy Cat cards have a picture of a cat on them. When one of the three scaredy cat cards are drawn, the player who drew it loses all of their bird cards. The bird cards are shuffled back into the deck along with the scaredy cat card.<br/><br/>The six Scarecrow cards each have a different part of a picture of a scarecrow on them. When one is drawn, it is placed in the middle of the table. When all six pieces are on the table, and the scarecrow is complete, the game ends and the birds are counted.<br/><br/>At the end of the game the birds on all the bird cards on the table are counted, the player with the most birds wins.<br/><br/>We have found that the game works best with three or more players. Two player games tend to go on for a long time with much frustration.<br/><br/>",

Each possible exhibition is made from collecting the right set of cards. Some are made with three cards, some with four, and one with six.

There are eight different sequences each starting from a number between one and eight.  The sequence is basically the multiplication table.  For example, the second number in the sequence that starts with 5 is 10 and the third number in that sequence is 15.  You do not have to stay in the same sequence. If you have played a 10, you can proceed with a 12 or 15.  The cards helpfully show which cards they can be played on and which cards can be played on them.<br/><br/>Each of up to four players is dealt three cards.  On each turn they can draw a card from the draw pile or the discard pile.  They then either place a card in their sequence or discard.  There are eight cards when played cause player to exchange hands.<br/><br/>Scoring is done by adding up all the points played by the player who completes his sequence of eight cards.  All the other players add up their cards played and subtract the points for cards still held in their hand.<br/><br/>",

Now there&rsquo;s one more for the list &ndash; Beards make the perfect backdrop for a fun party game!<br/><br/>The game centers around completing stunts with three different fake beards. On a turn, two players (either as a team or two cooperating competitors) will try to complete one of the many stunts represented on the cards in the game. Each card provides details about the challenge, the number of attempts allowed, and how many points the stunt is worth.<br/><br/>One player puts on a fake beard with a set of glasses, while the other grabs the plastic balls that are covered in Velcro. The team then follows the instructions given on the card, often trying to get the ball caught on the beard. If they succeed in the designated number of attempts, then both players (or the team) score the points!<br/><br/>Play continues until one player (or team) reaches 11, and he/she/they are the winners!<br/><br/>Contents include - 50 beard ball stunt cards, 5 beard balls, 3 stylish beards of varying difficulty levels, 1 pair of glasses, 1 Bearded die, 1 game board, and instructions<br/><br/>",

Each character has a set point value and changes the effects of the bids that are used to win the characters.  After each player has a chance to put a character into play, the hands refresh and new characters are dealt into play.<br/><br/>The bids consist of four suits: Stuff, Hobbies, Freakness and Tales.  Certain characters have different effects on the suits that maybe played.  Other cards Stops and Trumps allow to to eliminate rival player's cards or even knock them from the bidding entirely.  Hand management comes into play as your cards do no refresh until everyone has put a character into play.<br/><br/>Game takes approximately 10 minutes to play and is scalable, so the game takes the same amount of time regardless the number of players.  It is pure beer and pretzels and will have future expansions featuring more stereotypical con goers.  The game is best described as 1/3 luck, 1/3 strategy and 1/3 spite.<br/><br/>",

        "description": "The marketplace (&quot;tori&quot; in Finnish, &quot;torg&quot; in Swedish) of Vaasa (&quot;Vasa&quot; in Swedish) was a vivid trade center in the 1930's, to which people from the surrounding countryside came to sell their goods. Townsfolk frequented the marketplace and various goods traded owners.<br/><br/>The war had its impact on the nation in the 1940's and there was shortage in food as well as other products, which lead to that the range of goods was reduced in stores as well as in the marketplace. Trade in the black market became usual especially when the ration cards were taken into use. The nation recovered in the 1950's and the belief in the future got the trade started once again.<br/><br/>In the game the players try to accomplish various tasks and bring goods from the market stands to the stores located around the marketplace at the same time as they are looking for the missing whistle of the marketplace guard.<br/><br/>During the game the players receive rewards for accomplished tasks, such as new skills, which allow them to move on to more difficult tasks. However, the life at the markeplace is not that easy. Good and bad crop years, the rising population, the war, economical success, the belief in the future and different events in the society have their impact on the prices and the players' possibilities to carry out tasks.<br/><br/>This is an exciting and educating game for 2-4 players, in which local history and the memories of the elderly townsfolk of Vaasa are interwoven into an innovative boardgame.<br/><br/>The board has two sides, one easier and one harder. The game is suitable for both young and more mature players.<br/><br/>",

One of the players has all nine pyramids of lighter colors (white, yellow, red), the second has all nine pyramids of darker colors (green, blue, black).<br/>Start of the Game<br/><br/>The younger player rolls the die. The player with the color on the die starts. Players consecutively place one of their pyramids on the board.<br/><br/>Placing of Pyramids<br/><br/>You have to place one pyramid per turn. Once laid pyramids can not be moved during the rest of the game.<br/><br/>Pyramids can be placed on free fields, yours or your opponent's pyramids.<br/><br/>Attention! Pyramids can not be placed on pyramids of the same size nor on pyramids two size bigger/smaller.<br/><br/>When laying pyramids may therefore occur following four options. You can lay down:<br/>any pyramid on a free field<br/>small pyramid on any middle pyramid<br/>middle pyramid on any small or large pyramid<br/>large pyramid on any middle pyramid<br/><br/>Only top pyramid counts for the goal!<br/><br/>The goal<br/><br/>Players try to create a TROIKA of pyramids lying in one row or one column, or the two main diagonals on the 3x3 board.<br/><br/>TROIKA<br/><br/>TROIKA is any combination of your own pyramids in which the two basic parameters (color and size) occur either in the ratio 3:0:0 or 1:1:1 (either all the same or all different).<br/><br/>Examples:<br/><br/>Large red, medium red and small red do form a TROIKA, because their color scheme is 3:0:0 (three red, no white, no yellow) and size scheme is 1:1:1 (one large, one medium and one small pyramid).<br/>Medium blue, medium green and medium black do form a TROIKA, because their color scheme is 1:1:1 (one blue, one green, one black) and size structure is 3:0:0 (three medium, no large and no small pyramid).<br/>Large blue, medium blue and small green do not form a TROIKA, because their color scheme is 2:1:0 (two blue, one green and no black pyramid)<br/><br/>Troika Training<br/><br/>To explain the rules it always helps when you form several TROIKAS, especially if you play with school children. Take any two pyramids and challenge players to find the third pyramid required to form a Troika. Practice this several times.<br/>End Game<br/><br/>The game ends when the first player creates TROIKA in a row or column or one of two main diagonals on the board. This player is the winner.<br/><br/>If a player has at least one of his pyramids, but cannot place any of them, he loses the game.<br/>If both players run out of all their pyramids and no player created TROIKA, the player who did NOT start the game, wins.<br/><br/>(For this reason it is good to keep the die next to the game board.)<br/><br/>Rules of 5 games: <a target='_blank' href=\"http://www.mwe.cz/images/gettingstartedwithpyramids.pdf\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer noopener\">http://www.mwe.cz/images/gettingstartedwithpyramids.pdf</a><br/>To buy: <a target='_blank' href=\"http://mwe.cz/cart/index.php?route=product/product&amp\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer noopener\">http://mwe.cz/cart/index.php?route=product/product&amp</a>;product_id=73<br/><br/>",

On a turn, a player either draws a card from the deck and adds it to her hand, or she plays one card from her hand onto one or two cards already in play. When you cover a card already in play, the half of your card doing the covering must match the covered card in either number or color. If the card you play features an action symbol, that action takes effect immediately, skipping the next player's turn, changing the order of play, forcing the next player to draw cards, swapping hands with other players, and so on. As soon as a player's hand is empty, she wins.<br/><br/>SOLOmino includes a variant that allows a player to play out of turn if she can play a card that matches a card in both color and number. When this happens, the player lays down the card as if it were her turn, then the next player in clockwise order takes the next turn.<br/><br/>",

        "description": "In this game the players take over the roles of archeologists who are exploring a pyramid. Their goal is to find canopic jars and, ultimately, treasures. The first player to find and secure his treasure wins the game.<br/><br/>The pyramid, which is about to be explored, is built with the help of cards. All of these cards are placed face down in a 6x6 grid. Around half of the grid is built by light cards which cannot hide jars or treasures, the other half consists of darker tiles and are placed deeper inside the pyramid. Every player can spend 5 movement points. It costs 2 movement points to move through an undiscovered tile, but only one movement point to walk across a discovered tile. Players are not allowed to move diagonally and must always show their opponents the way they wish to take. Although moving through discovered tiles is faster, it can also be less handy and dangerous as you might not only discover a simple corridor but also a trap. Cards are used to move, look at undiscovered tiles or attack your opponents.<br/><br/>As soon as the first player discovers a canopic jar, the mummy awakes and starts to wander the pyramid. The mummy is moved by the different players and can be used to prevent an archaelogist from leaving the pyramid with a valuable artefact. When the mummy attacks, all items the attacked player has in his backpack are lost and returned to the pyramid.<br/><br/>If a player successfully leaves the pyramid with a jar, the card is taken out of the game and cannot be taken away from the player again. To prevent players from securing their treasures, other players can steal items or attack opponents to make them lose an object.<br/><br/>From the back of the game box:<br/>You are on the verge of meeting the greatest challenge an archaelogists could ever be faced with:<br/>Krimsutep's Pyramid<br/>Legendary treasures are said to be hidden inside the pyramid, but be careful. Legends speak of a curse that will be put on anybody who dares to enter the pyramid and tries to reveal its secrets. Not only does the structure of the pyramid pose a problem to eager archaelogists, but also the pharao himself does not wish to be disturbed. <br/>Who will be the first to find the legendary treasures of Krimsutep and get them to safety?<br/><br/>",

All the deeds, spaces on the board and cards are penguin themed and some have penguin facts on them.<br/><br/>Players roll dice to determine how far they move.  Landing on a space gives the player the option of buying the property.  When a player collects all the properties in one color group, the properties can be improved by building. When players land on a space owned by another player they must pay rent.  Rent is determined by the location of the property and the number of improvements on the space. Some spaces instruct a player to draw a card which can be beneficial or harmful to the player. Players must avoid going bankrupt to stay in the game.  The winner is the last player left in the game.<br/><br/>",

        "description": "The cheese in Cheese is a foam block, with numerous cylindrical bits of it sliced and removable.  Players take turns flipping the cheese block, trying to get it to land in particular ways, but not such that the nibbled corner is up while the cheese is on its broad face!  If you are successful, you mark the success of your wager by removing bits from the block of cheese, which alters the way it flips through the air.<br/><br/>Scoring:<br/><br/>     landing on the broad face, mouse nibbles face-down, 1 point<br/>     landing on the long edge, 3 points<br/>     landing on the short end, 9 points<br/><br/><br/>After each successful flip, rather than collecting your points, you can risk losing them by flipping again, in order to approach the goal more quickly.  The first person to 12 points wins.<br/><br/>",

In this unusual game the mighty Greek army must establish itself near the city of Troy and lay siege. Storming the mighty walls of Troy being a virtual impossibility, the siege of Troy shifts the war to a conflict over food. Can the Greeks starve out the Trojans? Can the Greeks themselves pillage enough food from the surrounding villages and towns to keep their own massive army fed? Can the allies of Troy relieve the besieged city and rush much needed supplies into the city before getting slaughtered by the Greeks surrounding the city. Can the Trojans strike a bold attack against the Greek main camp and break the siege completely? Will the Trojans dare use the Trojan Horse gambit?<br/><br/>Representing all of the heroes from this desperate war, with special rules for Hero units. Achilles, Hector, Ajax, Paris, Memnon and all the rest...<br/><br/>Striking a careful balance between homage to Homer's epic and known historical data of the period, the Trojan War presents a very realistic look at what the real world war between the Ionian Trojans and Mycenaean Greeks might have been like.<br/><br/>Affordable at a suggested retail of $15.95<br/><br/>Comes with:<br/>1) 17&quot; x 22&quot; 4 piece game map on thick index stock <br/>2) 8 page Rule &amp; Scenario booklet <br/>3) Score pad with 30 nation sheets <br/>4) 1D10 <br/>5) 135 plastic playing tokens <br/>6) 135 playing token stickers <br/>7) 8 1/2&quot; x 11&quot; pull out map of Troy. <br/>8) 12 Weather Effect Cards.<br/>9) Handy Dandy Box.<br/><br/>",

There are 8 different colours, and each colour is assigned a value from 1 to 8. The number printed on the central hexagon is the sum of the values of the three coloured hexagons on that tile (e.g. a blue-blue-red tile would have a value of 11 as blue = 4 and red = 3).<br/><br/>Game play<br/>The tiles are shuffled and each player is randomly dealt 7 tiles, which he/she puts in front of him/herself face up. The remaining tiles form the draw pile. Players take turns adding one of their tiles to previously laid tiles. Tiles always have to match in two colours, and the new tile has to be laid so that it touches only the edges of the previously laid tile. Players must not fit tiles into each other, there must always be a hexagonal gap between two tiles. A player who cannot add a matching tile continues to draw tiles from the draw pile and adds them to his/her tiles until he/she finds a matching one.<br/><br/>A round ends when a player has gotten rid of all his/her tiles. Each of the other players sums up the point values of their remaining tiles and scores are written down. After a previously agreed upon number of rounds, the player with the lowest score wins the game.<br/><br/>One of Ravensburger's Traveller-Series games.<br/><br/>",

        "description": "One player plays the god Yin, the another the god Yang. Players have a selection of square tiles divided into three types: Chi, Remedy and Sha tiles. The basic tiles are the Chi tiles, which are used to develop the flow of Chi across the board. They come in eight types: ten each of connecting tiles which take the chi energy from one edge of the square to one two or three other edges. There are a further eight Chi ending tiles, two each of four deigns which are needed to terminate unneeded Chi paths. There are also eight Sha tiles, two each corresponding to the the four Chi tiles. This can be placed upon the corresponding opponents tile and thereby blocking the flow. However, a player can overcome these blocks by using the Remedy cards, again two each corresponding to the four Chi tiles.<br/><br/>Each player draws a hand of four tiles (called a reserve) and each turn they can place one tile on the 8 x 8 board. (This is decorated with a Maltese Cross, which it appears only has a psychological effect, as there is no reference to it in the rules.) Starting at the entrance to their respective palace, each player seeks to develop a flow of chi to the other side of the board. As they play a tile, each player can replenish their reserve from their stock. If they are unhappy with their reserve they can replace up to the entire four tiles of the reserve, which then constitutes the entirety of their turn.<br/><br/>",

The Show-Off is dealt 9 cards, which must have no more than 3 of one suit (re-deal if he does have more than 3 of one suit). Once the dealer has settled his hand, nine cards are dealt to the other players.<br/><br/>Three rounds ensue... the Show Off plays 3 cards (must be different suits) and (in game theme terms) challenges the other players to out-do him with their stuff. Players play 3 cards from their hand and must do one of 3 things to &quot;keep up with the Joneses&quot;: <br/>1. play 2 cards which match in suit, of which one of those cards are higher in rank (3rd card does not have to match)<br/><br/>2. play 3 cards which do not match suits AT ALL, which the total value is higher than the Show-Off's 3 cards)<br/><br/>3. play 3 cards which all match in suit, regardless of value<br/><br/>Once we've determined if any players have &quot;kept up&quot;, we throw out all the cards played and the Show-Off lays down another 3 cards (from his now 6 card hand). Same thing happens.<br/><br/>This is followed by the 3rd round, which consists of everyone's remaining cards.<br/><br/>Now, to score this thing: <br/>if you can't match the Show-Off in the first round, you pay him 500 euro... if you get to round 2 but can't match there, 400 euro... round 3, 200 euro. If you match him in round 3, you get 200 euro from him for the two card match, <br/>400 euro for the different suit match, and 500 euro for the three card match.<br/><br/>Everyone gets to be the Show-Off one time (or more with fewer players).<br/><br/>",

Even better, they want to get their fellow magicians to guess the shapes of what they draw in the mirror!<br/><br/>To set up, players each take a magician tile and slide it into the bottom of one of the tile ladders; they also shuffle the 46 &quot;magic symbol&quot; tiles, each of which shows a line drawing of a familiar item, e.g., candle, butterfly, arrow, spider's web, etc.<br/><br/>The starting player draws a tile, takes the magic wand, and &quot;draws&quot; the image seen on this tile onto the back of the large &quot;mysterious mirror&quot; with the light of the wand. The other players try to guess the image drawn; the first player to do so gets to draw with the wand next, while the previous drawer places that tile into the bottom of her tile ladder. Players keep taking turns this way until someone pops her magician tile out of the top of the ladder, winning the game.<br/><br/>With two players, Der geheimnisvolle Spiegel is a co-operative game, with players taking turns drawing an image that the other player must guess. If a player draws three times and her fellow magician still can't guess, then the tile is placed into a third tile ladder. If this ladder fills before one of the magician's ladders, then they both lose the game.<br/><br/>",

Certain defined sections of the board can only have one of each number in them. When each of certain small sections of the board is filled, the tiles for each player in the section are totaled and points given for first and second place. Bonus points are also given for players who complete larger board sections. The sections which define the placement constraints, regular scoring, and bonus scoring vary from game to game.<br/><br/>The six games are:<br/><br/>1. Classic-SuDoku, played on the standard 9x9 grid.<br/><br/>2. Labyrinth-SuDoku, played on a board divided into nine irregular nine-square sections.<br/><br/>3. Killer-SuDoku, played on a board divided into many small sections.<br/><br/>4. Kakuro, played on a 9x9 grid interrupted by numbered squares. This game can be played two ways - in one version the numbered squares provide an additional constraint and way to earn bonus points.<br/><br/>5. 3D-SuDoku, played on a board which depicts three faces of a cube, giving eight-space rows in three directions.<br/><br/>6.

They have different power levels, so some of them are more difficult to beat. Fights are resolved using a die. If you lose the fight, a piece of your armour is removed. Once all of your six armour pieces are removed, you'll lose every fight you get involved in, until you repair your armour.<br/><br/>Among the enemy knights there are good knights (they're face-down counters too): if you reveal them, they shall give you a Gift (card) to help you in battle.<br/><br/>You should remember the position of the enemy knights (and/or the good ones) once they are revealed and put face-down again. Each player, at the end of his turn, moves two of the face-down counters around the board. You can move these counters to block the way to other players or even in a square with another player to force him to fight with the enemy knight you just moved! So, if you remember which knights are hidden on the counters you move, you can i.e. move a strong enemy knight towards another player, or a good knight toward you and/or far from other players.<br/><br/>Armour repair can be done in two ways: finding the counter representing the Gold Kinght of Aries, or passing through the Temple of Aries, located in the center of the top-level board.<br/><br/>Each of the three pieces of the board can be rotated before being placed, so the whole board can have a few different configurations.<br/><br/>",

The photos come from the countries of the European Union.  The cards must be laid out either by categories (set) or country (row).  Categories include Palaces or Parliamentary Buildings, Churches, Sights, Symbols, National Delicacies, and Letter boxes, all marked by pictograms for easy identification. Allocation for countries is done with the country identification in the upper left corner. In his move a player must draw a card from the pile and then if possible he can lay out cards, either a group of four by category or a group of three by country.  Cards already laid out can be used or rearranged by all players.<br/><br/>",

This is done by becoming the first Candidate to unlock the door to Evercent Springs with your Silver Key. Each Candidate is provided with 7 Companions to assist and fight for them; players must use them to stop their opponents from reaching the door while at the same time protecting their own Candidate and Silver Keys.<br/><br/>At the start of the game, each Candidate has a Silver Key and one Companion from each town carries a Spare Key. If you lose both Keys, your hopes of becoming Mayor are over and you are out of the game.<br/>During the game you will face many challenges, including opponents, pubs, holes, havens, bribes, and the Council.<br/><br/>The players start in their Hometowns; the door to Evercent Springs is located at the center of the board. On your turn, you move one piece. You can move your Candidate closer to the door; you can move away from an aggressive opponent&rsquo;s piece; you can go to the Pub; or, you can capture an opponent&rsquo;s piece and thereby eliminate it from the game. You can only capture an opponent&rsquo;s piece if it&rsquo;s within reach AND is lower ranked than your piece; the Council has ranked the Companions according to three categories, and the Council&rsquo;s Cards show which category is now being used to rank the Companions. The players can meet with the Councillors during the game and try to have them change the category; you get to turn over a new Council&rsquo;s Card and hope for the category you want. Or, you can bribe The Council, and get to choose category!<br/><br/>Bribing The Council is one of the Ways &amp; Means in the game; if you have Gold Coins, you can purchase advantages. You can also purchase an Extra Step; a Hole Tile that will make a square on the board unusable; a Haven Tile to protect your Candidate; or even buy back eliminated Companions to the game. If you want to buy Ways &amp; Means, that must be done prior to moving your piece. <br/>With Gold Coins, you can also make Deals with your opponents&hellip;<br/>To get your hands on more Gold Coins, you can get lucky with the Pub cards, or eliminate opponents&rsquo; pieces. Or make good deals!<br/>Should your Candidate be captured, and you still have the Spare Key, you&rsquo;re still in the game. The Companion carrying the Spare Key is sacrificed and removed from the board, and your Candidate is being put back on your Hometown&rsquo;s Street, but you can still reach the door to Evercent Springs and win the game.<br/><br/>If you lose your second key as well, then it&rsquo;s game over for you. <br/>Only Candidates can unlock the door to Evercent Springs, and thereby win the game.<br/><br/>Strategy, tactics, luck and bribes are some of the tools to win this game; keeping your Candidate with their Silver key safe and at the same time be bold enough to first reach the door to be appointed Mayor of Evercent Springs.<br/><br/>&mdash;description from the publisher<br/><br/>",

The spinner determines the letters and category for each round. For instance, the category might be &quot;Food &amp; Drink&quot;, and you may be looking for words that begin with a 'P' and contain an 'A' - 'Pizza' and 'Pasta' may come to mind, or maybe 'Pancakes' and 'Peaches'. What about &quot;Places&quot; that start with a 'B' and contain an 'N'? You may think of 'Boston' or 'Birmingham'. If you can't think of any &quot;Places&quot; with those letters, you can still score points - just fewer - by coming up with words outside the category, like 'Banjo', 'Bargain', etc. You get the picture. There are different ways to score points, and the more points you score the more spaces you advance on the board. Every round provides a whole new challenge, and there are countless possible combinations to wrap your mind around. WORDPLAY is addictive fun that will make your head spin!<br/><br/>",

When one player has gotten all six, the game ends and the one with the most points wins.<br/><br/>There are six areas of deeper seas around the central island, each of which must be visited once by each player as well as a shallow area between the island and those deep spots in which players can capture secondary photographs to earn money (VPs) through giving lectures on the island.<br/><br/>The amount you can move depends on the air in your tank and is reduced by the depth of your dive (at turns start).  Balancing depth and distance is the significant tactical challenge of the game.<br/><br/>",

        "description": "This game is a simplistic &quot;spin-and-move&quot; for kids based on Eastman and Laird's Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles comic/tv/movie franchise.<br/><br/>Production quality for the TMNT Ready for Battle game ranges from good (quality of the illustrations and a good, functional spinner) to poor (lots of poor die-cutting on the cheap-feeling cardboard pieces, and an even cheaper-feeling box).<br/><br/>The object of the game is to collect two each of pizza and weapons tokens, and then reach the finish space to get your designated &quot;bad guy&quot;.<br/><br/>Each player starts as either Michaelangelo, Donatello, Raphael or Leonardo, and chooses the matching Battle Card.  Each Battle Card has two spaces each for pizza and weapons tokens, and a designated bad guy.  The bad guys actually are just decoration, as they all wait together in the &quot;hideout&quot;, which is part of the finish space.<br/><br/>Game play proceeds with each player spinning the spinner, advancing to the next space on single, linear path from start to finish that has the same color as the one just spun, and collecting either the pizza or weapon token found there.<br/><br/>The linear path is on a a nicely illustrated 15&quot; x 15&quot; board, with clearly labeled &quot;Start&quot; and &quot;Finish&quot; spaces.  There are 12 pizza spaces, 11 weapons spaces and two special &quot;Splinter&quot; spaces (Splinter is the benevolent rat master from the comics/tv/movies.)  The Splinter spaces allow for a &quot;redo&quot; if a player has yet to collect the needed tokens before advancing to the finish space.<br/><br/>In summary, a very, very simplistic roll-and-move style game for die-hard fans of the game.  The box states &quot;4 and up&quot;, but I imagine beyond 6 years a child would bore of the gameplay itself.  Nice theme presentation, but very little game.<br/><br/>",

        "description": "&quot;Roue Breizh / The Lords of Broc&eacute;liande&quot; is strategy game set during the Dark Ages in the Celtic land of Brittany (the north-west corner of France). In the Breton language &quot;Roue Breizh&quot; means &quot;King of Brittany&quot; (Roue is pronounced &quot;Rou&eacute;&quot;, the old pronunciation of the French word Roi or King). The game comes with an educational booklet setting out the history of what was, to the medieval mind, a mystical land associated with the knights of the Round Table and the legendary forest of Broc&eacute;liande.<br/><br/>In this game, players play the feudal lords of Brittany who have survived the fall of Rome (or have fled from their original homeland: Britain) and now face barbarian invasions from the sea and the encroachments of the Frankish kingdom from the east. The Breton lords gradually settle and connect up their different domains, establishing towns and defending themselves against the terrible Vikings and Northmen. The aim of the game is to found ever larger baronies, counties and duchies, whether on one's own, or in combination with the domains of an ally. At the end of the game, one of these lords will be crowned King of Brittany: the &quot;Roue Breizh&quot;!<br/><br/>Mechanisms: Kingdoms are made and unmade, alliances are formed at will. There's no elimination of players. Instead, players are given the chance to form alliances, and may freely give and receive lands as they make or break alliances at the end of each turn. During a turn, members of the same alliance are not allowed to attack each other. Being a member of a strong alliance will allow each player in the alliance to have a better dice-roll in times of conflict. Some players are also members of the Council of Broc&eacute;liande, which gives its members more power, but also - inevitably - the obligation to redistribute resources and to promote the development of other players instead! Gaming enthusiasts will certainly enjoy the fact that &quot;Roue Breizh&quot; gives a decisive advantage to team-play, through the principle of rotating &quot;coalitions&quot;. Between each round of play, the formation and re-formation of teams gives rise to complex interactions between the players as they negotiate the terms of their alliance.<br/><br/>(This is an amended version of the summary published on the Tric Trac website, in French).<br/><br/>",

        "description": "In Shake Shake Tower &ndash; this game's original name &ndash; players start the game with eight 3D curved polyomino pieces in a single color, then take turns placing them on a swiveling, seesaw-style platform. Gravity pulls the platform and pieces from side to side as the tower rises, so players might have a tough time adding a piece to the stack &ndash; especially since each level must be filled before players can play on top of other bricks. If a player can't legally play, she must skip her turn, so play strategically to block others while leaving yourself room to grow!<br/><br/>If you knock pieces off the tower, you keep them on the side, losing one point for each brick in such a piece. When a player plays her final piece, the game ends. Players then score one point for each brick of theirs visible from a top-down view of the tower. Whoever has the high score wins.<br/><br/>Tremblex, a revised version of Shake Shake Tower, uses the same pieces and nearly the same scoring method, but players are free to place pieces as they wish on the tower &ndash; with one small exception that drives play in a different direction. Each piece you place must touch one of your pieces already in play; if all of your pieces have been covered by other players, then you're forced to sit out until someone else knocks pieces off the tower! Once this happens, all players are back in the game. The game ends when a player places her final piece, and players tally their scores, earning one point for each brick showing from a top-down view of the tower, losing one point for each brick in pieces knocked off the tower, and collecting a three point bonus if their piece is highest up in the tower.<br/><br/>Tremblex includes variant rules as well, such as a cooperative mode in which players try to complete the tower with no holes and a two-player game in which opponents place pieces only on their half of the platform, trying to scale higher than the other player in order to win.<br/><br/>",

Match two pictures: The player draws a number chip, marks the respective photo card, then everyone picks a number chip which corresponds to the photo that matches the selected photo card best.<br/><br/>2. A word on a word card is randomly selected. Players now mark which photo matches that word best.<br/><br/>3. A photo is randomly selected. Players now mark which word on a word card matches the photo best.<br/><br/>4. Players choose which of the photo cards matches the active player best.<br/><br/>Afterwards, points are scored: The active player gets a point for each other player making the same choice as s/he. The other players who guessed correctly also score one point each. If nobody guessed correctly, the players get a point for each other player making the same choice as them.<br/><br/>Points are marked on a score track. The first player to reach 16 points is the winner.<br/><br/>The Danish (Original) version plays slightly different:<br/><br/>There are only 3 pictures shown at start of the game.<br/><br/>Each player gets 10 tokens, and 10 tokens are placed in the common area.<br/><br/>Players bet any number of tokens on their answer. Wrong and you loose your tokens to the common area. Right and you gain a number of tokens from the common area equal to your bet. The active player gains a number of tokens equal to the players who guessed correctly.<br/><br/>Game ends when there are no more tokens in the common area.<br/><br/>The player with the most tokens is the winner.<br/><br/>",

The combat mechanism is fun and adds an element of luck and skill without much complexity. The game system is infinitely expandable.<br/><br/>Players will assemble a &quot;dungeon&quot; by creating a stack of coasters that includes rooms, monsters, and treasures. They then adventure through the dungeon by turning over tiles, battling the rooms, defeating the monsters, and looting the treasure. Along the way, they may pick up magical treasures or spells that can help them in their quest. If they survive the dungeon, the player with the most treasure points wins. If they do not, the dungeon wins. But either way, there will be laughs and maybe even a drink or two!<br/><br/>Battles are resolved by players trying to drop quarters on coasters. If they miss, players take hit damage. If they land on the coaster, the monsters take damage. Battles continue until either monster or player is eliminated.<br/><br/>&mdash;description from the publisher<br/><br/>",

The players lay color rows out before themselves using their snail maps. Each player tries to protect  their color rows as quickly as possible, because only those cards score when they are played.<br/><br/>The game consists of 110 cards with different moves for snails on them. Among them are colored snails, Schnarchschnecken, snails cards and turbo-snails. To begin play, all cards are mixed and each player is dealt 5 cards for their hand. In addition 3 sets of snail cards are laid out in the center of the table. (thus again in each case 5 pieces) are laid out. These form the exchange supply.<br/><br/>If a player puts the fifth snail into a color row, this row is protected. Those cards are put aside and are counted as one point per card. Added to his own snail cards,  the player receives a card with  same color numbers as the other players. There is also a wild card color which can be added. That card is is collected by all, is thus particularly lucrative but in  addition it is risky to try and collect  . By means of this pfiffigen mechanism the author achieves a high interaction between the players. These are practically always into the play merged.<br/><br/>The special snail maps bring an additional attraction into the play.

Rather than building words from a limited number of letters, each player first rolls a special die, which serves both to dictate the limits of his/her word, and as a one-minute timer.  (The die itself is pressure-sensitive, and will start timing when rolled.)<br/><br/>Players must add letters or words to the existing word-pattern, as indicated by the die.  (For example, a die roll of &quot;+2&quot; means they must add two letters to the board, with the result being a still-legitimate crossword configuration.)<br/><br/>A player can always, in lieu of rolling the die, select from a deck of cards that define a general type of thing (e.g. &quot;birds,&quot; &quot;sports,&quot; &quot;words beginning with 'R'&quot;) The player must add a word that meets the criterion of the card.<br/><br/>Points are scored for number of letters in newly formed words, with standard Scrabble-like bonus spaces applying.  First player to set number of points wins the game.<br/><br/>",

Little witches go there every day to practice their tricks. It takes a lot of practice to be a good witch! Today, all the little witches are allowed to practice their tricks in the forest.<br/>If they pass their witches&rsquo; test, they will receive a delicious spider cake for their hard work.<br/>All of the important things a good witch needs are hidden under orange stones in the big fire where the witches dance. To pass the witches&rsquo; test, you must know what is under each stone. But watch out! There is a wicked witch hiding somewhere. If you uncover her, you must go all the<br/>way back to the space behind the last player. Each of you junior witches should pay close attention during the game. The first student to reach one of the spider cakes wins the game.<br/><br/>To play the game:<br/>Each player chooses a witch playing figure and places it on<br/>the witch school in the top left corner of the playing board. This is the starting space. In the witches&rsquo; fire, you<br/>will see everything a good witch needs: a black cat, a raven, a toad, a book of spells, a bat, a magic wand, a magic hat, a broom and a cauldron.<br/>For about 15 seconds, the children should carefully look at<br/>the 10 stones in the witches&rsquo; fire and try to remember where everything is located.<br/>Then the stones should be turned over.<br/><br/>Throw the dice and see what colour you rolled. The spaces in the witches&rsquo; forest correspond to the colours on the dice. Move your witch to the next space of the same colour you rolled. Look at the picture on the space where you landed. Can you remember where the same picture is located<br/>under the orange stones? If you choose the right stone, your witch can stay on that space. If you choose the wrong stone, your witch must GO BACK.<br/>Return to the first space you come to that corresponds<br/>to the colour on the dice (at the beginning, simply return<br/>to the witch school). Don&rsquo;t go back to the space you just<br/>came from!<br/>But watch out! If you accidentally turn over the wicked<br/>witch , you must go all the way back to the playing<br/>space behind the last witch (it does not matter what<br/>colour that space is).<br/><br/>",
