        "description": "This new edition of Greenland includes the Sea Sami expansion pack so it is playable with up to 4 players.<br/><br/>The four players in Greenland represent the Tunit (Player Green), Norse (Player Red), Sea S&aacute;mi (Player Blue), and Thule (Player Yellow) tribes inhabiting Greenland from the 11th to the 15th centuries.<br/><br/>As a tribe, you attempt to secure food, resources, and technology to increase the size of your tribe and support children, elders, and livestock while also wiping out competing species or gathering resources to collect victory points. You must work around the weather and the extinction of natural resources as well as negotiate deals to protect your wives while you decide between monotheism or polytheism. In this tableau-building game, you'll send your population out to hunt native species of Greenland &mdash; but some might not come back. (Historically, the climate turned frigid and all but the Thule (Inuit) died out.)<br/><br/>In the game, play takes place over six phases; all players complete each phase in turn order, then the next phase starts. Each turn is one generation. In order:<br/><br/>Resolve events: Examples include elder deaths, animal migrations, feuds, or global cooling. If a trade ship arrives, an auction is held for its wares.<br/>    Assign hunters: Hunters are assigned to hunting grounds, resource gathering, colonizing the New World, raiding other tribes for wives or animals, or promotion to an elder.<br/>    Negotiate: Players can bribe others to peacefully withdraw hunters, including marrying them to their daughters. Players with a War Chief Elder can use hunters to attack others on the same card. The New World turns hostile if there are too many colonists.<br/>    Resolve hunting: Roll a die for each hunter and modify it for technologies and marriages. Success can result in gaining new hunters, resources, hand cards, wives, and/or technologies. Beware, as some animals can be confused by the prey-predator relationship and your hunters might not return. Some successes let your take cards from the central play area into your hand if within hand limit.<br/>    Maintain livestock: Pay to keep the animals you've already domesticated.<br/>    Take elder actions: Examples include invention, domestication, proselytization, and witch-burning. If you have no elders, you can convert to monotheism.<br/><br/>Depending on each player's ending theistic worldview, he has a variable scoring based on successful hunts (polytheism) or resource gathering (monotheism).<br/><br/>",

Players can use one set or the other or combine them in various ways to alter the powers available in the game. Shuffle all the cards together (other than the second &quot;Lost Legacy&quot;), and you can include up to six players in the same game. Cards from Lost Legacy can also be combined with Lost Legacy: Hyakunen Senso to Ryu no Miko and Lost Legacy: Binbo Tantei to Inbo no Shiro.<br/><br/>\t\t\t\t<br/>\t\t\t\t<br/>\t\t\t\t\tRules SummaryLost Legacy is a game of risk, deduction, and luck for 2&ndash;4 players. You start the game with one card in hand from a deck of sixteen cards. On a turn, you do the following:<br/><br/><br/>         Draw: Draw the top card from the deck and add it to your hand.<br/>         Play: Choose one of the two cards in hand to play and place it face up in front of you.<br/>         Effect: Carry out the played card's effect, after which the card is considered as discarded.<br/>         End: If there is at least one card left in the deck, the turn goes to the next player; if not, the investigation phase starts. Using the investigation speed indicated on the card each player has in hand, players take turns guessing which player (whether yourself or someone else) holds the &quot;Lost Legacy&quot; card; this card might also be in the &quot;Ruins&quot;, a location that holds one card at the start of the game and possibly acquires more cards during play. The player who guesses correctly wins; if no one finds the Lost Legacy, then everybody loses.<br/>    <br/><br/><br/>",

This is clearly the work of Goblins, and the pained gasps of a dying Woodman tells you that the survivors were taken by the fiends to their lair within the forest.

Slowly but surely an overwhelming mutated jungle started to grow. It was driven by an ungoverned survival instinct, and with each passing year it devours new kilometers of human earth. It assimilates everything it comes into contact with, changing animals and people into mutated beasts and symbiotic organisms, which enable it to go forward and destroy the next threat. This huge green and ferocious organism was called Neojungle.<br/><br/>Neuroshima Hex! Neodżungla is a single army expansion for Neuroshima Hex! The main advantage of this army is the ability to create a Motherland, which lets one Module simultaneously help all units which belong to the Motherland. Even units which are weak alone can become fast efficient killers.<br/><br/>The disadvantage of the army is its relatively low mobility, lack of shooters, and the fact that without a Motherland the units are rather weak and slow.<br/><br/>Neuroshima Hex!

        "description": "The Supreme Monarch gazed out his palace window, trembling with rage at the galaxy that had forsaken him. For long months he had retained his people's allegiance by branding his enemies as barbaric invaders, as marauders whose only goal was to plunder and ravage his empire. But now reports were spreading that these invaders were rebuilding their conquered worlds and adorning them with marvelous advancements. Moreover, many of the realm's greatest heroes were flocking to his enemies' side, and their heroic exploits were fast becoming the stuff of popular legend.<br/><br/>The situation had worsened. This was no longer a mere incursion into his territory, a simple uprising to be quelled. The galaxy now stood at the threshold of something far greater, something far more dangerous. And his people dared to embrace it! But he would make his people suffer, even if his retaliation ended in the devastation of entire worlds. He would not allow his kingdom to betray him with impunity, even if he was ultimately powerless to stem the tide of the coming REVOLUTION!<br/><br/>Core Worlds: Revolution allows players to delve deeper into the story of the Core Worlds universe. Players will be able to build incredible Advancements on their conquered Worlds, including Cosmic Terraformers, Wormhole Generators, and Dark Energy Power Cores. Players will also be able to employ Heroic Tactics keyed to specific Heroes, such as Baron Viktor's &quot;Sacrificial Lambs&quot;, the Promethean Cyborg's &quot;Accelerated Procurement,&quot; and Queen Alais's &quot;Warrior Queen.&quot; Each Hero will command 3 unique Heroic Tactics kept in a separate Heroic Deck beside the players' regular draw decks. The expansion also features 3 new Heroes (Captain Alexander, the Prophet, and Duke Magnus), each complete with his own set of Heroic Tactics.<br/><br/>Core Worlds: Revolution includes nearly 100 new cards that magnify the richness and excitement of the Core Worlds universe!<br/><br/>",

There are three variants of War Machines: cannons, rocket batteries, and powerful siege crossbows.<br/><br/>Not only you will be able to use them in the game, greatly enhancing your defense potential, but also, each player will get a few upgrade cards to choose from, giving further variation and replay possibilities to the War Machines. For example, one player might favor building cannons, but they want them to be as cheap as possible, while another might concentrate on a single but very powerful one.<br/><br/>Additional Horde types &amp; Siege Engines<br/>Mongols have brought some siege engines with them! Some of the Hordes cards will come with the special engines to try and break your walls. Defend yourself against battering rams, which will break your walls, catapults, which will strike your archers, and Hordes with siege towers, which will change the way you plan your defense. They will try and counteract your towers, employing miners to tear them down.<br/><br/>New Hordes will add to the replayability while being able to be used in basic games as well.<br/><br/>New Troops!<br/>Each Clan sends out their elite warriors to join the fray - all of the Clans will have their own unique and extremely powerful Soldier! You can upgrade one of your basic Soldier types into an elite. For example, Snake Clan will be upgrading their Archers into Chu-Ko-Nu Crossbowmen, being able to outshoot any of the opponents quickly. On the other hand, Dragon Clan, as befits their name, will equip some of their Spearmen with fire-lances. You can be sure they won&rsquo;t be cheap, but if you can get them recruited early in the game, you will gain a huge advantage over the Hordes (and your opponents).<br/><br/>New Generals, Advisor, Artefacts and Tech-Trees!<br/>This expansion brings also new Generals, Advisors and Artifacts to further enhance replayability and allow for bigger customization of your desired tactics.<br/><br/>Additionally, this expansion will introduce Tech-Trees creating new exciting possibilities of development for each clan. Whit those cards you will be able to adjust your strategy and invest into Towers, War Machines or enhanced Army units!<br/><br/>&mdash;description from the publisher<br/><br/>",

You may play it after finishing any of the other three large campaigns, and take your favorite heroes on a last, one-way mission to mysterious Homelands. Their ship will slip into the mists separating Avalon from our reality, and spend many weeks traversing the border between the worlds. Finally, it will emerge back in Homelands, many years after the plague, where answers to some ultimate questions lie buried under the rubble of desolated cities.<br/><br/>What happened here after most humans departed for Avalon?  <br/><br/>     Is it safe to return?  <br/>     What caused the plague?  <br/>     How did Arthur learn about the island of Fore-dwellers?  <br/>     What secrets did he leave behind? <br/><br/><br/>Red Death is an expert-level expansion campaign for Tainted Grail. It contains 32 dangerous Location cards that allow you to visit a part of a kingdom ravaged by plague, where unspeakable horrors still lurk among the ruins. These horrors won&rsquo;t be your only problem! The ancient undersea empire of Fomoria already surveys the lands abandoned by humans, while brutish Picts of the north, who somehow built resistance to the disease, raid the ruins looking for treasure, magic &ndash; and something more sinister. Then, there are solitary survivors who outlasted the plague. They&rsquo;re often mad and dangerous, but their knowledge may help heroes survive.<br/><br/>Pick your allies and enemies, solve difficult riddles, navigate ruins of the old world and face some of the hardest Encounters created for Tainted Grail. And if you survive, learn things that will put the main storyline of three campaigns in a new light.<br/><br/>This add-on campaign will contain approximately 15-30 hours of gameplay grouped into an 8-chapter story. Just like our base campaigns it offers multiple endings and branching paths, so you can try to solve it in a different way multiple times!<br/><br/>Extended Character Advancement<br/>Naturally, a large amount of additional gameplay meant we had to extend the Character progression. That&rsquo;s why the box also includes new and exciting Advanced Abilities that can help you upgrade your Attributes even further!<br/><br/>Not to mention that many artifacts or items found in Homelands are much more powerful than anything found on Avalon.<br/><br/>&mdash;description from the publisher<br/><br/>",

But the Dead come seldom forth and only at times of great unquiet and coming death.&rdquo;<br/>   &ndash;J.R.R. Tolkien, The Return of the King<br/><br/>The road of your journey has led you this time to the Kingdom of Dale. A shadow has risen over this great realm of Men, and now King Bain must call upon heroes in order to investigate disturbing rumors and restore peace to his kingdom. It is once again time for a new adventure.<br/><br/>Fantasy Flight Games is pleased to announce two new products for The Lord of the Rings: Journeys in Middle-earth:<br/><br/>The Haunting of Dale downloadable campaign<br/>Haunting of Dale is the second downloadable campaign available for purchase through the Journeys in Middle-earth companion app, offering a completely new set of quests and challenges that require both the Core Set and the new Shadowed Paths expansion to play. With thirteen new adventures and a branching storyline full of mystery and intrigue in and around the Kingdom of Dale, the trials presented by this campaign are sure to thrill even the most experienced Fellowship.<br/><br/>The party has been summoned by King Bain, son of Bard the Bowman and current ruler of Dale. Concerning rumors have emerged of a dangerous shade stalking the land, cattle have been vanishing or turning up dead, and tensions are rising with the neighboring Dwarves in Erebor. At the behest of King Bain, you must convince the council of Dale that you are capable of investigating these rumors and&mdash;hopefully&mdash;able to combat the shade as well. However, time is of the essence, and there are more rumors than you will have the opportunity to chase.<br/><br/>In Haunting of Dale, players will learn of multiple rumors regarding the shade and other events surrounding the region of Dale. They will need to decide which rumors to pursue, knowing that they cannot pursue all of them in a single playthrough. Depending on which leads they follow, the players will explore not only Dale and its surrounding farms and wilderness, but also the neighboring Erebor, where the party can seek the shade while gaining the friendship of the Longbeard Dwarves. These multiple branching paths make every playthrough of the Haunting of Dale campaign unique, allowing players to return to Dale again and again for plenty of thrilling adventures.<br/><br/>-description from the publisher's website<br/><br/>",

        "description": "Imperial forces on Tatooine may not have the same sway as Jabba&rsquo;s gangsters, but they can still be dangerous and violent&mdash;especially if their authority is not respected. Several Stormtroopers have adopted the native dewback as a mount and organized a cavalry division under the command of the vicious Captain Terro. A Stormtrooper mounted on a powerful creature like the dewback is not to be underestimated, and the Galactic Empire gains a new tool in its arsenal with the Captain Terro Villain Pack.<br/><br/>The heroes may come into contact with Captain Terro himself or just a Dewback Rider from his command, but either one would be a dangerous opponent. The dewback mount gives these warriors a prodigious amount of movement, and by striking from the creature&rsquo;s back with shock lances or flamethrowers, a single Stormtrooper can cause a massive amount of carnage or split a hero party in two. With a new three-card Agenda set that challenges the heroes to stop a Stormtrooper reprisal against Anchorhead, a new skirmish upgrade, and new Command cards for your skirmish games, this Villain Pack offers a powerful new weapon to every Imperial commander.<br/><br/>This is not a standalone product. A copy of the Imperial Assault Core Set is required to play. Includes missions that require the Jabba's Realm expansion.<br/><br/>",

        "description": "From the publisher:<br/><br/>Across the galaxy, few Imperial institutions command more fear than the Imperial Security Bureau. Your neighbor or your family member may secretly serve the ISB. The man you pass on your way to work or the talkative woman in the cantina could be an informer. You can&rsquo;t trust anyone, and in this atmosphere of stifling fear, few dare to speak of rebellion. Now, you can enforce the status quo and punish sedition in your games of Imperial Assault with the help of the ISB Infiltrators Villain Pack.<br/><br/>If the heroes are unlucky enough to encounter them on a mission, the ISB Infiltrators prove to be dangerous combatants, using the new Hidden condition to reduce enemy accuracy and gaining surges to deal more damage and increase accuracy. More than that, each ISB Infiltrator benefits from the Coordinated Raid ability, which allows another figure in the group to interrupt and perform an attack. Obviously, more attacks can significantly increase your damage output over the course of the game.<br/><br/>Whether you&rsquo;re using their unique talents in a campaign or a skirmish, this Villain Pack offers additional cards and missions to supplement your adventures in the Star Wars galaxy. A new Agenda set, Command cards, Reward cards, and a skirmish upgrade offer you additional tools for any mission, from the ISB&rsquo;s vaunted training grounds to an Imperial facility on Bespin.<br/><br/>",

No matter whether you have the Emperor navigate Coruscant and its intrigues in your campaign or lead his army into quickly fought skirmishes, his impressive melee skills and inherent Pierce &quot;3&quot; offer only the merest hints of his full range of power.<br/><br/>And, as befits his status as master of the dark side of the Force and supreme ruler of the galaxy, the Emperor also comes with a full suite of Force-themed Command cards and an Agenda deck that allows you to explore his many plots.<br/><br/>This is not a standalone product.

Accompanied by a single survivor, you must venture beneath the boughs of a foreboding forest, battling deadly foes and the forces of nature to save the missing villagers from a most gruesome fate. As you move through the adventure, new encounters and areas are revealed from a randomized Exploration deck, meaning you&rsquo;ll never face the same adventure twice!<br/><br/>Note: The rules for the Nature&rsquo;s Ire expansion are not included in the box.

Design competitions and advertising campaigns eventually lead to increasingly imposing avant-garde buildings. So imposing, in fact, that it becomes necessary to provide green spaces in order to maintain the air quality in this boomtown. And don't let the speed of construction cause you to forget the standards expected ... an occasional inspection will set you straight!<br/><br/>In more detail...<br/><br/>New Buildings - the nine new building tiles (three for each color) form a tile supply that is kept separate from the game's general tile supply. Three random building tiles from the general supply are removed when playing with these tiles.<br/><br/>When you draw tiles, you may choose to draw one of these tiles instead of drawing two regular tiles. The cards for these tiles give new end game bonuses if you have them in front of your screen at the end of the game.<br/><br/>Prestige Buildings - the six new building tiles (three for each color) are placed face up in three piles separated by color, with tile 24 on top and tile 25 beneath. Three random building tiles from the general supply are removed when playing with these tiles.<br/><br/>When you draw tiles, you may choose to draw one of these tiles instead of drawing three regular tiles. There are no cards associated with these tiles, so it is not possible to build on or further utilize these tiles.<br/><br/>Green Spaces - there are nine Green Space tiles that are placed face up in a separate pile. Three random building tiles from the general supply are removed when playing with these tiles.<br/><br/>When you draw tiles, you may choose to draw a Green Space tile instead (one per turn). You can use a Green Space tile in an Urbanization action, but may not use one to cover an existing building. There are no cards associated with these tiles, so it is not possible to build on or further utilize these tiles.<br/><br/>During the game you score additional points for Urbanization actions that take place next to Green Space tiles. At the end of the game Green Spaces add their resources to the totals of adjacent districts when determining majority scoring.<br/><br/>Events - Players will start the game with two of the four event tiles in hand. These can be played in addition to the card (and possible tile) that you chose for your action. The event allow players to gain tiles, resources or success points in various ways. One event tile causes other players to lose success points.<br/><br/>Keep a card - this module is a short rule that allows you to keep a card during the Choose a card step of the game, giving a little more control over the game.<br/><br/>Experts - Experts are new character cards that players receive at the start of the game. Each player starts with four Character cards and two Experts. After the starting cards are drafted, each player should end up with three Character cards and one Expert. If you are also playing with the Events module, the Expert you hold determines which two Events you have for the game.<br/><br/>",

        "description": "This is THE LAST HURRAH - the sixth ASL module. The eight scenarios contained herein focus on historical situations involving the early German blitzkriegs of World War II and the many nationalities that fought against the invaders. Paratroopers, armor, air power, audacity and courage were the tools with which Germany planned to overrun the neutral nations of Europe.  and in less than two years, in actions as far apart as Norway and Crete, the German military accomplished all they had set out to do.  <br/>For the most part, the invaded neutrals (Poland, Norway, Belgium, the Netherlands, Yugoslavia and Greece) were defended by hastily-mobilized reservists stiffened by a few elite units.  The actions depicted in THE LAST HURRAH will challenge veteran ASL players to match the tenacity, audacity and victories on both sides in eight scenarios, recreating the German march of conquest.  Experience - as only ASL can let you - the desperate fighting of these first days of World War II.  Whether commanding German armor, Polish cavalry, Greek infantry, Belgian Chasseurs, Norwegian reservists or Luftwaffe paratroopers, if you're an ASL grognard, you're bound to find something pleasing in the wide spectrum of scenarios included in THE LAST HURRAH.   There is even a scenario pitting those age-old foes, the Poles and the Russians!<br/><br/>THE LAST HURRAH contains eight scenarios, one countersheet of Allied Minor infantry and support weapons - and two boards: 11, with revised artwork; and 33, which features open terrain and a large grainfield.  <br/>ASL, BEYOND VALOR  and YANKS (for two scenarios) are needed to play these scenarios.<br/>     <br/>Contents:<br/><br/>    Boards 3 [2nd edition only], 11 &amp; 33 [all editions]<br/>    Scenarios 43-50<br/>    1 Counter Sheet<br/><br/><br/> <br/>Scenario List:<br/><br/>    43 Into the Fray<br/>    44 The Gauntlet<br/>    45 Revenge at Kastelli<br/>    46 Birds of Prey<br/>    47 Rude Awakening<br/>    48 Toujours L'Audace<br/>    49 Piercing the Peel<br/>    50 Age-Old Foes<br/><br/><br/>(from MMP's website and user's description)<br/><br/>",

The natives seem friendly enough, crying their peace cries, and giving you spears and poison darts before you are even close enough to accept them properly. When you finally reach those ports you will conquer them, and from there you will look for more rivers.<br/><br/>One day, all the rivers will be yours.&quot;<br/><br/>Dominion: Seaside (Second Edition) contains nine new types of Kingdom cards, which will be released on their own as an update pack for those who own the first edition of this expansion. A few cards will receive minor errata, but these will not appear in the update pack.<br/><br/>",

Each of the boards from the main game has a corresponding battlefield, and players maneuver heroes and villains on these battlefields to improve their position in the fully integrated main game.<br/><br/>From the ancient ruins of Weathertop to the conflict at the Black Gate of Mordor, the journey of the Fellowship of the Ring is marked with battle. The armies of Sauron are on the march, and unless the courage and faith of the Fellowship can hold, the Shadow will be victorious.<br/><br/>The new Battlefields expansion for Reiner Knizia's acclaimed The Lord of the Rings board game focuses on the deadly combats that the Fellowship must survive on its quest to destroy the One Ring. Now in addition to guiding the Fellowship through its many perils, the players also help to hinder or defeat Sauron's powerful armies, because the farther enemies march on the battlefield board, the more destruction they cause and the closer Sauron comes to recovering the One Ring!<br/><br/>Will Aragorn arrive in time to defend against the Witch King at Weathertop? Will Boromir's courage hold against the savage Uruk-Hai? Will Gimli's axe be enough to withstand a horde of orcs at the Chamber of Mazarbul?

        "description": "Cities have fallen, cities have stood, but outside of those protections, humans must face the creatures of darkness on their own terms. In the lawless countryside of Nightfall, the beast within can wreak havoc like never before.<br/><br/>Nightfall: Blood Country, an all-new expansion for the deck-building game Nightfall, features new vampires, werewolves, hunters and ghouls. Blood Country also introduces innovative abilities for your wounds, creating new effects beyond those just on the card!<br/><br/>Each card has a main color and two linking colors. If you can match the main color of a card to one of the linking colors of the previous card, you can chain those cards together. Once a chain is started, players all get an opportunity to link additional cards onto the chain during that turn. Cards in the chain resolve in reverse order: first in, last out. Instant effects fire off as cards come off the chain, doing damage to your opponents or bringing characters into play to defend you and attack your opponents.<br/><br/>The object of Nightfall is to put wounds into your opponents' decks and end the game with the fewest wounds in your deck. But beware: The more wounds a person has, the more enraged they become and the faster their deck works, meaning more cards and bigger chains will come your way!<br/><br/>Blood Country is an expansion and requires Nightfall or Nightfall: Martial Law in order to play.<br/><br/>",

And from that loss came the Wager Master.<br/><br/>As reality formed and matter came into being, all of the losing wagers - all of the impossible possibilities - also formed into being. Into a specific being: the Wager Master.<br/><br/>The Wager Master appears however it wants. It commonly goes for centuries without showing up anywhere in the Multiverse. But when it does show up, it&rsquo;s a safe bet that things will go wrong. The Wager Master thrives on playing with the rules of reality. It appears to a race of sentient beings, plays games with whatever champions they might have, and ultimately destroys everything it encounters as they inevitably lose the Wager Master&rsquo;s games. Those who lose to the Wager Master become mere playing pieces for more twisted games.<br/><br/>Now, unfortunately, the capricious Wager Master has appeared on earth. Too many things have gone wrong. Too many coincidences and too many confluences point to the truth: we are all pawns in the cruel game of an entity as old as the Multiverse. What chance do the Sentinels of that Multiverse have?<br/><br/>---<br/><br/>Sentinels of the Multiverse: Wager Master Villain Mini-Expansion is a new villain character, with his own unique villain deck of 25 cards, a rules card, and a character card.<br/><br/>",

Though this expansion was originally going to be named Surviving Mars, Eagle-Gryphon Games made the decision to change the name to On Mars: Alien Invasion to better reflect the theme and content of this expansion. The game narrative is contained in four chapters of a story written by Nathan Morse. Gameplay contains four new and different ways to expand upon and play the base game. You will play one versus many; completely cooperatively; and even solo if you wish, depending on the chapter. Included are four fresh and completely replayable ways to establish colonies On Mars!<br/><br/>For instance, here is the narrative that opens the first chapter and sets the stage for all of the following action:<br/><br/>Alert! Sensors indicate that aliens are invading the famous red planet! Long have the conspiracy theorists predicted this. The threat to your mission is too great; you must take action. Will you be able to prevent the infectious spread of these beings bent on expanding to every habitable planet in the galaxy? Or will you play for the other side, a species trying to establish a colony on Mars, blithely oblivious to the danger their expansion represents, unaware that there are others out there eager to keep humans &ldquo;where they belong&rdquo; on Earth. <br/> &mdash;description from the publisher<br/><br/>On Mars: Alien Invasion is a short story expansion to On Mars made in 4 chapters with 4 different modes of play.<br/><br/>The short story is called Alien Invasion and contemplates the following Chapters and modes of play:<br/><br/>Chapter 1 - Invasion - 1 vs All - 3 to 5 players<br/>Chapter 2 - Outbreak - Co-Op - 2 to 4 players<br/>Chapter 3 - Blackout - Co-Op - 2 to 4 players<br/>Chapter 4 - Monolith - Solo - 1 player<br/><br/>&mdash;description from the designer<br/><br/>",

        "description": "Space Empires: Replicators, the second expansion in the Space Empires series, adds a number of features to the base game, starting with the Replicators. Von-Neumann Machines (&quot;Replicators&quot;) are self-replicating machines that behave, research, and reproduce differently from other empires, while having their own Empire Advantages. Replicators can be used by a fifth player, as an opponent in co-op games, or as a teaching empire for new players as the Replicator player doesn't have to fill out a production sheet or track the technology on his ships.<br/><br/>Space Empires: Replicators also includes hex-sized terrain tiles for planets, asteroids, nebulae, and other permanent terrain effects. When an exploration marker reveals a terrain effect that stays on the map, the exploration marker is removed and replaced by a tile, giving the map a nice visual effect. (By removing the exploration marker, this also creates more room in the hexes because now the entire hex is the terrain.) For epic games, the backs of some of these tiles can be used to connect two Space Empires Boards.<br/><br/>New Deep Space terrain is included in this expansion, with the Galactic Capital (which comes with its own scenario), Regional Map, Gravitational Anomaly, Space Pirates, and the Fold in Space.<br/><br/>Each player also is dealt his own (random) resource deck at the start of the game. Everyone starts with a hand of three cards and draws a new one each turn. These cards can be used as an event or turned in for CP. Cards impact battles, exploration, economics &mdash; almost every aspect of the game; they can add unpredictable twists and impact your strategy. More powerful resource cards require you to discard an extra card to play them.<br/><br/>New Ships are included in Space Empires: Replicators, with these ships requiring a new technology &mdash; Advanced Construction &mdash; to be researched. There are three levels of Advanced Construction, and it cannot be researched until the Economic Phase after your empire has built a BC or larger ship. Thus, they won't be available until the middle game at the earliest. The ships opened up by Advanced Construction include:<br/><br/><br/>    Battle Carriers (BV), which are large carriers that can fight well, carry six Fighters, and come equipped with Anti-Sensor Hull (immune to Mines). Fighter 4s can also be researched and built.<br/>    Advanced Destroyers (DDX) that can mount Attack 2, Defense 2, and come with Heavy Warheads (automatically hit on a 1 or a 2).<br/>    Advanced Raiders (RX) that can mount Attack 3, Defense 3, and can carry one ground unit!<br/><br/><br/>All of the advanced ships can also be equipped with Fast technology (similar to BCs) if Fast 2 is researched. These changes don't impact the early and midgame, but make the DDs and Rs relevant in the late game. Raiders and Fighters are often curve balls that, once the opponent has reacted to them, lose their potency. This gives players another chance to throw a curve later in the game.<br/><br/>Some additional counters have been included for all players. The Fleet and Miner counters that were misprinted in the Close Encounters expansion have also been corrected. Additional Empire Advantages have been added.<br/><br/>",

Her cargo was untouched and the personal belongings of passengers and crew were still in place. What had caused the crew to abandon ship? The terrible truth was soon apparent. The Key Celeste had become a ghost ship!<br/><br/>Key Celeste, a mini-expansion for Keyflower being released at UK Expo, comprises one large Key Celeste hexagonal tile, one oversize grey ghost keyple, and a rules sheet. Players bid for the Key Celeste tile and obtain the ghost in the same way that they bid for the turn order tiles. The owner of the ghost can use it to frighten away and replace another player's winning bid. The player who played the ghost takes the replaced worker(s) and places them behind his screen. These workers are now available to play by that player in the usual way. Points are available at the end of the game for the owner of the Key Celeste tile and additionally for the ghost if they own both.<br/><br/>Key Celeste adds more interest and considerations to Keyflower and changes this popular game in more ways than gamers are likely to initially anticipate!<br/><br/>",

If you encounter him, he may help you stave off the end of the world and let you peer into the future &mdash; or you may be attacked by demon horsemen and stalked by cursed followers.<br/><br/>Time is running out. When the Harbinger entered the realm he brought with him a prophecy of impending doom and a series of seven Omens to watch for: when the seventh appears, the end is upon you. Talisman (fourth edition): The Harbinger Expansion features four unique decks of Omen cards, each making manifest a different downfall. In one Omen deck the constellations align, threatening the extinction of magic. In another, the dead rise from their graves and battle to overthrow the living. In another, the time of judgement arrives bringing with it war, famine, death, plagues, and other forms of destruction.<br/><br/>In the fourth, the world shatters into many pieces and the terrain transforms unpredictably. New Terrain cards enter the game and alter the landscape, supplanting fields with barrens, deserts with floodlands, and cities with bogs. As doom draws nearer, more and more of the realm is transformed until the seventh Omen appears and all of Talisman becomes a deadly devastation.<br/><br/>In game terms, when the Harbinger is in your region, you must draw from the peril-filled Harbinger deck instead of that region's normal Adventure deck whenever you are instructed to draw cards. When you draw an Event, the Harbinger moves into your space, but has no ill effects upon you. However, you move into the space occupied by the Harbinger, you must roll a single die. The result could grant you a second turn, or let you look at the top three cards of any deck you choose. It might force you to populate your space with vicious enemies, treacherous followers, and unpredictable events. Worst of all, your result might cause the current Omen to be discarded, activating the next Omen and hastening the advent of the end times.<br/><br/>",

The six maps consist of settings for American Airborne, Utah Beach, Omaha Beach, Gold Beach, Juno Beach, and Sword Beach. Each battle can be played individually or assembled with its neighboring scenarios for double- and triple-map battles. With enough players (and enough components), you can link all six battle maps to form a giant board that recreates the entire Normandy coast!<br/><br/>Memoir '44: D-Day Landings requires at least one copy of Memoir '44 as well as the Terrain Pack, Equipment Pack, and Winter Wars expansions. The Mediterranean Theater expansion is recommended, though not required. To play a double-, triple- or sextuple-map battle, more copies of the base game or expansions are required.<br/><br/>",

It features area control, resource management, and a new game mechanic - &quot;auction programming.&quot;<br/><br/>You play as a potential successor to the throne following the death of your father, Vladimir the Great, in 1015. The people value a well-rounded leader, so you must establish your legacy by building, taxing, fighting, and accomplishing great deeds. Will you win over the hearts of the people to become the next ruler of Kievan Rus?<br/><br/>Rurik brings to life the ancient culture of Kievan Rus with game design by Russian designer Stanislav Kordonskiy and illustrations by Ukrainian artist Yaroslav Radeckyi.<br/><br/>In Rurik, players openly bid for actions with their advisors. Stronger advisors earn greater benefits at the cost of performing their action later than other players. Conversely, weaker advisors earn lesser benefits but perform their action quickly. This planning mechanism (&quot;auction programming&quot;) adds a fun tension to the game.<br/><br/>&mdash;description from the publisher<br/><br/>",

These winged devils will be pecking at you in no time, so you better be always prepared for them!<br/><br/>The Murder of Crowz box contains 15 Zombie Crowz miniatures, 12 spawn cards, and rules to play them.<br/><br/>Note: This item, although functioning in a similar way to Zombicide: Box of Zombies – Set #8: Murder of Crowz, does not expand Zombicide, and Zombicide: Box of Zombies – Set #8: Murder of Crowz does not expand Zombicide: Black Plague, because of the card backs.

        "description": "It is December, 1941; Europe lays stricken beneath the Nazi boot. Only Britain, sheltered by her fleet and the English channel, stands fast before the swaslika. To the East, German panzers stand stalled by winter at the very gates of Moscow. However, the Third Reich is nearing its high water mark for the tide is about to turn. The Japanese attack on Pearl Harbor will usher the United States into World War II and seal the doom of the Thou&shy; sand Year Reich. American industry will supply the Allied armies with vast quantities of war material, and a fresh, new breed of fighting man will enter the fray against Hitler's tested Wehrmacht. The G.I. will become the anvil on which the victory over a bled white Wehrmacht is forged.<br/><br/>G.I.; ANVIL OF VICTORY allows you to command the full gamut of American fighting men as they drive the Germans from Africa, Sicily, Italy, Normandy, and back across the Rhine and into Germany itself. G.I. adds the complete American arsenal of fighting men and machines to your SQUAD LEADER repertoire, while expanding and enriching the most acclaimed historical gaming system yet devised. Can the greater numbers and superior-gunnery control systems of the American Shermans compensate for the more lethal guns of the feared German Panther? G.I. pro&shy;vides a gripping and graphic answer unmatched by any book.<br/><br/>But G.I. offers far more than just American tanks. It contains more components than any of the preceding games in the series. The entire game system has been streamlined while enhancing realism even further. German, British, and even French infantry counters have been revised to enhance unit identification, add inherent smoke values, and more clearly distinguish the differences between squads, crews, and half-squads.<br/><br/>In each game you get: <br/><br/>    1040 two-sided 1/2&quot; die-cut counters representing the infantry combatants of the European Theatre from 1942-45 .<br/>    528 two-sided 5/8&quot; die-cut counters representing the complete vehicular and ordnance Order of Battle for the U.S. in World War II <br/>    Illustrated scenario cards for situations 33-46 <br/>    Five additional 8&quot; x 22&quot; geomorphic mapboard sections increasing the possible terrain configurations many told and introducing several new terrain types [mapboard 8, 12, 13, 14, 15]<br/>    Comprehensive, illustrated 36-page Programmed Instruction Rulebook <br/>    Two expanded Quick Reference Data Cards <br/>    Terrain Overlays to further vary existing mapboards<br/><br/><br/>(source: the back of the box and user's description)<br/><br/>",

A horde of undead, led by dark priests, attacks Deephall constantly. These unending attacks deplete the city's guards and erode the peoples' resolve. Four heroes are all that stands between Deephall and the city's extinction.<br/><br/>Descent: Journeys in the Dark (Second Edition) &ndash; Guardians of Deephall contains four heroes and three monster groups; these figures were previously available in the first edition of Descent, but are now brought in line with second edition aesthetics through reimagined figure sculpts and artwork. You'll find the orc warrior Mordrog battling in the front lines alongside Lord Hawthorne. At the same time, Sahla, a gifted Healer, focuses his power by channeling the strength of other heroes, even as the deadly assassin known as Silhouette uses her stealth and cunning to cut her enemies down.<br/><br/>The battle for Deephall's fate plays out in two new quests. In &quot;Guardians of Deephall&quot;, the heroes must defend the walls of Deephall against a seemingly endless assault of undead and dark priests. Then, in &quot;The Curse of Iona&quot;, the hero party must venture into the icy lair of a dragon sorceress to reclaim a pendant that may be Deephall's salvation.<br/><br/>",

Without the torches, equipment essential to any adventurer who respects himself, you will not be able to be enter the oppressive darkness.  Many other elements of terrain will come to enrich your party and could also be used to create your own original scenarios.<br/><br/>New creatures include:<br/><br/>The Vampire(4/2): Undead. His combat value increase each time he kills an opponent. Can change to an undead  bat with (6/0)<br/>The Mummy(3/4): Undead. Break porticullis. Strong and not too slow, but he has a flaw: if all adjacent oponnent in a fight has a torch, the mummy's owner is forced to play his 0-card.<br/>The Ghoul(6/2): Undead. He can carry the opponent's wounded character. If he exits the dungeon with any wounded character, he gets an extra Victory Point.<br/>The Undead Dragon(2/6): Undead. Can regenerate just like the troll. Gives two victory points to the player killing it.<br/>The Necromancer(4/2): Magic User. For one action point, he can transform an adjacent wounded character, even the opponent, into a zombie(3/2, undead). Can raise a zombie from a grave (special terrain type).<br/>The Angel of Light(5/1): Can light the darkness as if she was carrying a torch, using her magic ability.<br/>The Shadow(4/2): Undead. Can act in the darkness as if it was a normal terrain type.<br/>The Specter(4/0): Undead. Can move through any terrain type. Gives no point if it exits the dungeon. Can resurrect into an opponent wounded character. The specter &quot;die&quot;.

It arrives to X-Wing as a devastating Imperial starship in the TIE Punisher Expansion Pack, accompanied by four ship cards and a punishing array of nine explosive upgrades, with which you can obliterate your enemies. In addition to boasting a slightly larger payload than the TIE bomber, the TIE punisher invites Imperial players to perfect their bombing skills by taking advantage of both its innate boost action and its ability to equip a system upgrade like Advanced Sensors. With Advanced Sensors, the TIE punisher can boost into position to drop a bomb right in front of an enemy fighter, and then it can immediately perform its maneuver to fly away.<br/><br/>",

Her Force leaps allow her to move quickly into position wherever she&rsquo;s needed most, and then she can press the attack with one blue die and two green dice, as well as the ability to reroll all her attack dice or all the defender's defense dice.<br/><br/>You&rsquo;ll find more of Ahsoka's talents, spirit, and connection to the Force represented among the expansion&rsquo;s mission and Command cards. Four of these Command cards strengthen her connection to the Force, and the fifth takes full advantage of her talents as a Spy. Finally, two new skirmish missions provide ample opportunities for you to fight alongside Ahsoka, sowing chaos in the heart of the Empire.<br/><br/>This is not a standalone product. A copy of the Imperial Assault Core Set is required to play. Includes missions that require the Heart of the Empire expansion.<br/><br/>",

        "description": "At the height of the Galactic Civil War, the Imperial-class Star Destroyer was the commanding cornerstone of the Imperial Navy. Measuring 1,600 meters in length, a single Imperial-class Star Destroyer would boast a crew of more than 37,000 and carried a standard complement of four TIE fighter squadrons, one TIE interceptor squadron, and one squadron of TIE bombers. It could also carry an entire legion of stormtroopers, along with AT-ATs, AT-STs, and other landing craft. Most importantly, each Imperial-class Star Destroyer sported armament powerful enough to bring wayward systems to heel under Imperial control.<br/><br/>The Imperial-class Star Destroyer Expansion Pack brings this behemoth battleship to your games of Armada with one pre-painted miniature, two ship cards, three command dials, eighteen upgrades, and all requisite tokens.<br/><br/>Moreover, even as it affords you the opportunities to snare your foes with a tractor beam and fly your fleet to battle under the command of Darth Vader, the Imperial-class Star Destroyer Expansion Pack introduces a new type of defense token to your Imperial fleet: the Contain defense token. Featured on both the Imperial I-class and Imperial II-class Star Destroyers, the Contain token can cancel the standard critical effect of a shot that passes through your shields to your hull. Given the devastating nature of many of the critical effects in the Armada damage deck, the Contain token is a valuable tool that you'll want to spend wisely as you use your Star Destroyers to spread fear throughout the galaxy.<br/><br/>",

It&rsquo;s like fighting an entire army, not just a single creature!<br/><br/>Neuroshima Hex!

Playing as a new JSA Super Hero will add new strategies and goals to your gameplay. New Super-Villains will spice up the First Appearance Attacks that players have grown to love and fear. Finally, a few signature Super Powers, Equipment, Heroes, Villains, and even a Location for the main deck will add a little bit of extra JSA flavor to the set.<br/><br/>Crossover Pack #1 features the Justice Society of America, usually known simply as the JSA. These classic Super Heroes have been around for a long time and often claim top talent authors and artists, such as the worldfamous Alex Ross! You will find several pieces of his work in this very set. Their stories continue to this day and feature characters extremely important to the DC lore, such as Doctor Fate and Power Girl.<br/><br/>Naturally, these Super Heroes will be fighting against their own stable of classic Super-Villains, such as Solomon Grundy, Eclipso, and Ultra-Humanite! The JSA flavor continues with some of the Super Heroes&rsquo; own abilities added to the main deck: Mystic Bolts and T-Spheres.<br/><br/>Crossover Packs are the perfect way for players to customize their DC Comics experience to suit their own tastes and to play with their favorite characters!<br/><br/>",

Although all of these soldiers are trained in battle, a few truly excel at guerrilla warfare and long-range attacks. These renowned snipers are known as the Alliance Rangers, and they can join your campaigns and skirmishes with the Alliance Rangers Ally Pack.<br/><br/>Alliance Rangers may help a small team of Rebel heroes survive among the dunes of Tatooine, or they may battle Imperial Stormtroopers under the canopy of a mighty forest, but wherever they&rsquo;re deployed, these warriors are among the most deadly long-range fighters in the game of Imperial Assault. This Ally Pack comes with plenty of other ways to alter your campaign missions or skirmish games as well. You may travel to the planet Ithor to silence an Imperial recon facility, or move deep into the Nal Hutta Swamps and silently battle another strike team in the backwaters of the Hutt homeworld. No matter which way you prefer to play, the Alliance Rangers are a powerful asset for the Alliance to Restore the Republic.<br/><br/>This is not a standalone product. A copy of the Imperial Assault Core Set is required to play. Includes missions that require the Jabba's Realm expansion.<br/><br/>",

To that end, he may be willing to stick to the Coruscant shadows and skyrises for a short time, stalking his prey, but it won't be long before his rage and fury get the better of him. Then, when Maul leaps into the fray with his iconic dual-bladed lightsaber, you'll find him more than capable of cutting cleanly through the defenses of any who stand against him. And while much about this former Sith is shrouded in mystery, you'll quickly learn that he's sustained by rage and almost always looking for a fight.<br/><br/>This is not a standalone product. A copy of the Imperial Assault Core Set is required to play. Includes missions that require the Heart of the Empire expansion.<br/><br/>",

You&rsquo;ve learned some of why you came to Innsmouth, and you&rsquo;ve battled the evils rising from the ocean deeps&hellip; but as you escape from the Deep Ones overrunning Innsmouth and race toward the Falcon Point lighthouse, you find yourself at the threshold of the next mystery. Who was it that first captured you and left you for dead?

With a game play focused on high-octane conflict fueled by raging war and cutthroat politics, it also introduced players to a rich science fiction setting, with its own back story and its own secrets. Exodus: Edge of Extinction expands both the gaming and the narrative aspect of Exodus: Proxima Centauri into an even more epic space strategy empire building game.<br/><br/>Exodus: Edge of Extinction represents the next chapter of an immersive story in which the remnants of humanity go to war against each other over a system they believe to be Proxima Centauri. Each player leads one of six unique factions with their own histories, strengths, unique special abilities and a set of new, exclusive technologies.<br/><br/>Exodus: Edge of Extinction also brings larger fleets, custom action cards and completely new mechanisms like the Combat Cards, adding a whole new layer to the spectrum of strategies already available in the base game.<br/><br/>",

Just mix the 55 transparent cards in this set together with your copy of Gloom to add morbid new Modifiers, Events, and Untimely Deaths, and a new family of intrepid explorers who've faced misfortune across the globe. These days Colonel Bumpersnoot is really more of a bargain hunter, while Lady Bumpersnoot struggles with high society -- but she always loves to have guests for dinner. Their Towering Treehouse is included as a Residence card to use with the Unhappy Homes expansion.<br/><br/>Unfortunate Expeditions introduces expeditions into the game.

At the end of a player&rsquo;s turn, all the meeples they drew are put onto the &ldquo;lodging&rdquo; part of the player&rsquo;s board.<br/> During the game, players will score victory points by defeating monsters, completing quests, and investigating towers. At the end of the game, players will score additional victory points by fighting boss monsters and through end-of-game quests. The player with the most victory points wins!<br/><br/>This Kickstarter edition includes a bunch of upgrades and extras, including the 4-towers expansion (20 tiles) and everything you need to play the solo version (7 Royal Guard Order Tiles, 1 Royal Guard Board).<br/><br/>&mdash;description from the publisher<br/><br/>NOTE: The retail edition can be found here: Meeples & Monsters.<br/><br/>",

Red hot lava will soon consume the three secret Seien-ji (聖煙寺), sacred temples hidden deep in the bowels of the volcano. The Shōgun is determined to preserve the precious heritage and sends his most noble and gifted samurai warriors on a quest inside the volcano to retrieve the valuable goods.<br/><br/>After a grueling climb through snowstorms and treacherous rocky terrain the samurai find the entrance that leads down into the cavern.<br/><br/>The volcano rumbles and the walls start shaking! The floor underneath their feet crumbles and our brave samurai fall into the huge cavern that contains the three temples, which are slowly sinking into the smoldering lava.<br/><br/>It is now up to our heroes to explore the cavern and find as many of the relics, sacred scrolls, and monks as possible, to bring back safely to the Shogun before the volcano erupts and all is lost forever.<br/><br/>Fuji Koro can be played in a competitive mode with 2 to 6 players or a cooperative mode with 1 to 6 players.<br/><br/>Players will try and gather sacred scrolls and blueprints for magical weapons, gather resources, craft the best possible gear, and try to get out of the volcano before it fully erupts. To make matter worse, players will encounter fantastical dragons on their journey throughout the volcano, that they will have to try and defeat by themselves or with the help of other players.<br/><br/>The game continues until the end phase of the game, which is triggered by one player reaching 30 victory points. Once that happens, players will have 8 final turns to escape the volcano.<br/><br/>To win the game, a player will have to score the most victory points by defeating dragons, exploring the cave, crafting the right weapons and bringing magical gear, dragon teeth and monks to the Shōgun during the end phase of the game.<br/><br/>Extra's from KS campaign:<br/><br/>     Extra large double-sided game board<br/>     Extra solid cardboard box<br/>     6 Highly detailed Samurai miniatures<br/>     13 Highly detailed Dragon miniatures<br/>     Premium sleeves and tuckbox<br/>     Wooden pieces replacing cardboard pieces: monks, sacred scrolls, magical blueprints,etc. ...with heat transfer print<br/>     KS exclusive Ninja character<br/><br/><br/>",

These easily recognizable starfighters were designed for speed and maneuverability, rather than durability, and the aces who flew them through many battles quickly earned intimidating reputations for their combat skill and fanatical loyalty.<br/><br/>The Imperial Fighter Squadrons Expansion Pack for Star Wars: Armada introduces an array of eight starfighter squadrons, evenly split between four different types of fighters. By adding these TIE advanced, TIE interceptor, TIE bomber, and TIE fighter squadrons to your fleet, you'll be able to swarm your foes, protect your capital ships, and send the Rebellion&rsquo;s hopes down in flames.<br/><br/>",

For example, Marianne lets you take any one resource card if you rolled something other than a 7, but didn't get resources from that roll. As each player builds her second settlement, she takes a specific card based on player order, with approximate utility increasing to help combat earlier player advantage. A player must use her card's ability before she may turn it in, but she may choose which card to take, adding a level of strategy.<br/><br/>",

        "description": "This Age of Steam Expansion #4 contains a two-sided board with France and Italy.<br/><br/>France : Paris is a multicolor city with very strong goods growth (represents 1-6 Black on the growth chart). Many actions have changed : Urbanization is weaker, Production stronger and you need the engineer to build on mountains.<br/><br/>Italy : there are no &quot;towns&quot;, only cities and you can not build new cities (no urbanization). You can only build one complete link per turn (no hex limits). There is no more share limits and penalty for issuing shares is less than usual. Also, beware of the black goods, as their movement can decrease your income.<br/><br/>This Age of Steam expansion was first released in a limited Essen Set edition at Essen 2004 by Winsome Games. It was re-released at Essen 2005 by Warfrog in a hard map edition with a print run of 3000 pieces.<br/><br/>",

(Artist is Doris Matth&auml;us.)<br/>     The Siege has been re-released with new art by Rio Grande Games in October 2008 as part of the Mini Compilation Cult, Siege &amp; Creativity.  (Some have expressed concern with the new artwork as it is harder to see that a city is under siege.)<br/>     A 6 tiles version of The Siege called 'Die Belagerer' (again with new art but similar to the Rio Grande edition) is part of the Carcassonne Müller Exklusiv-Edition released in 2013 and sold by the German trade company M&uuml;ller.

Winter sleep is, in the end, just a cover for a secret arms race...<br/><br/>Winter, an expansion pack for both 51st State and The New Era, introduces new rules and 54 new cards to both games that will reward gamers who prefer sustainable development over unpredictable aggression.<br/><br/>Winter lasts six weeks &ndash; i.e., six rounds &ndash; and during that time players prepare for the war that will take place after winter. Each round players can send their workers to Frozen City, a special mini board, to hire mercenaries and find new leaders. With Winter, the aim of the game has changed; you no longer fight for 30 victory points (VPs), developing in a rush to hit that total and win before the other player. Now you have a precise amount of time in which to plan and build, in which to develop your faction.<br/><br/>Winter introduces a new Texas faction that's crowded with people (four workers in the production phase) and has the possibility of using one of its faction contacts twice in a round.<br/><br/>",

On each turn, dice are rolled to determine what resources &mdash; sheep, wheat, wood, brick and ore &mdash; the island produces. Players spend these resources to build settlements, roads, and cities and to purchase development cards that have different effects. Each settlement and city you have is worth points, and you can gain additional points by building the longest road, acquiring the largest army, or collecting certain development cards. The first player to collect 10 points wins.<br/><br/>In CATAN: 3D Edition, the island of Catan rises off the table for an immersive experience like no other. Your settlements grow from fertile grain fields, and your cities nestle into the sides of majestic mountains. The look of the land is based on terrain tiles hand-sculpted by game designer Klaus Teuber. All of the terrain is hand-painted for stunning color, and the intricately-designed player pieces are antiqued for a look that's full of history and character.<br/><br/>&mdash;description from the publisher<br/><br/>Note that this is the same game as CATAN, but a decision has been made to keep the entry separate.<br/><br/>",

In Barkham Horror: The Card Game &ndash; The Meddling of Meowlathotep, a 78-card standalone scenario pack, the investigators must stop Meowlathotep, the Prowling Chaos, Meowsenger of the Outer Feline Gods, who is terrorizing the city of Barkham. Only a few precious pups can defeat the various Meowsks of Meowlathotep and prevent them from destroying Barkham and the world!<br/><br/>When this adventure kicks off, you are hot on the trail of a cat conspiracy. A catspiracy, if you will. Dogs all across town report seeing strange, unnatural cats prowling the streets of Barkham, and each day more and more pigeons are going missing. You've picked up the scent of something big, and once you sink your teeth into a story, you just can't let go. A little wet fur has never stopped you from finding the truth. Perhaps if you investigate the areas of Arkham most plagued by these sightings, you can root out the cat‐monsters that dwell within.<br/><br/>&mdash;description from the publisher<br/><br/>",

When the Nautilus performs a successful Search Action at that Ocean, you reveal and place its Adventure token. You can then go questing for that adventure and try to earn the big rewards it offers.<br/><br/>With the Adventure motive, you can also commence play with a new Nautilus Upgrade card: Diving Apparatus which assists you with all Test rolls for which you spend 2 Actions and helps keeps the Adventure Deck stocked with gemstones.<br/><br/>The Humanist motive sees Captain Nemo desiring to better the plight of the common people. Potentially starting with the Hospital Machines Upgrade card, it allows the Captain to parley with ships at sea using &ldquo;Diplomacy Attacks.&rdquo;<br/><br/>Although Notoriety gains are a big problem, successful diplomacy allows you three courses of action: Further Diplomatic Relations, Create a Diplomatic Incident, or Gather Support for Your Good Intentions.

Whenever they score points during the game, they decide which scoring meeple to advance; if a meeple lands on one of the dark spaces on the score track (0, 5, 10, etc.) and the owner of that meeple is the active player, then that player draws the top message tile from the track and either scores two points for it or takes the action shown on the tile. The possibilities are:<br/><br/><br/>    Score that player's smallest road, city or cloister as if it were the end of the game, but leave the meeple in place.<br/>    Score two points for each banner in a city that player occupies or two points for each of that player's knights.<br/>    Score three points for each of that player's farmers.<br/>    Draw and play an additional tile.<br/>    Score one follower and return it to that player's supply.<br/><br/><br/>Whichever option the player chooses, he then places that tile on the bottom of the message stack.<br/><br/>At the end of the game, players add the scores represented by their two scoring meeples, place one meeple on that sum, then figure out their final scoring, earning no more messages.

Used properly, lag is static, and static is another form of code.&quot;<br/>    &ndash;Tori Hanzo<br/><br/>The Spaces Between, the second Data Pack in the &quot;Lunar Cycle&quot; for Android: Netrunner, continues to reestablish the game's cyberstruggles amid the moon's reduced gravity, recycled air, and corporate-sponsored colonies, simultaneously re-examining one of the game's fundamental conceits: What happens to events and operations after they're played? Events and operations represent a variety of ephemeral processes that occur both in the meat world and the virtual one. When they hit the discard pile, do their impacts just disappear? Or if they transmit signals into space, might their echoes ever linger, gain a sort of permanence in their repetition, and impact future events?<br/><br/>The sixty new cards from The Spaces Between (three copies each of twenty different cards), re-examine the essential natures of the game's events and operations, and every faction gains a new current, an event or operation that isn't immediately resolved and discarded after it's played, but continues to reside in the data streams somewhere between a state of transience and a state of permanence.<br/><br/>",

One might see the Islands as an opportunity for political connections, but a witcher or a mage would rather travel there to train, hunt monsters, and seek an adventure. It may be of great benefit to visit Skellige Islands, as well as other, unexplored ones, but such travels rarely come without a cost.<br/><br/>You get a sizable Board extension with all-new locations and location tokens. Your map gets bigger and more interesting. There is a special way to travel to the Islands by using Ship miniatures, and each travel always comes with a new, sea adventure. There Is a special Deck of Exploration and Event Cards just for that Expansion, and some of them may result in Dagon, an ancient monster, being summoned.<br/><br/>Expansion contents:<br/><br/>- 1 Dagon monster miniature<br/>- 3 ships miniatures <br/>- 1 game board<br/>- 1 large monster card<br/>- 6 harbour tokens<br/>- 50 exploration cards<br/>- 30 event cards<br/><br/>Expansion compatibility:<br/><br/>- It works with standard game and basic solo mode.<br/>- It doesn&rsquo;t fully work with Wild Hunt, since a big part of it consists of new Exploration Cards. Players may decide just to add the map with the new locations and Ship travel.<br/>- It can be combined with all Modes from the Monster Trail.<br/>- It can be combined with the Legendary Hunt.<br/>- You can use Mages, Lost Mount, as well as Adventure Pack while adding Skellige Expansion.<br/><br/>&mdash;Kickstarter summary<br/><br/>",

Like the squadrons from the Core Set and the first wave of expansions, these come unpainted, but are presented in colors that complement their fleets.<br/><br/>Meanwhile, since these squadrons include the signature starships of some of the galaxy's most individualistic pilots, each is represented by a single miniature, and several of them allow you to take advantage of the new Rogue keyword, which grants a squadron the ability to both move and attack when it's activated during the squadron phase. Still, that's not the only new keyword introduced in this collection; both the Grit and Intel keywords appear on a number of its squadrons and introduce new tactical abilities that can help you steer the course of your Armada conflicts.<br/><br/>",

When used together, eight new laws (which reference materials in the expansion) can also be added to the game.<br/><br/>With At the King's Court, new offices are available to be filled, with the Lords (i.e., the players) applying for them in search of power and privileges. Each player receives a token representing himself, the Lord of his land, and to claim these offices they'll need to bring the Lord token &ndash; along with supporting knights and a particular form of tribute, such as a voting marker or gold &ndash; to the office in question, whether Lord High Chancellor, Lord High Constable, or Great Lord Chamberlain. If you win the position, you'll collect official seals, an archer to use in battle against France, or the first Tudor knight in England. When you upgrade a knight, you may now collect a bishop &ndash; and the number of bishops you hold is multiplied by the seals you've acquired for an endgame bonus.<br/><br/>With The King's Resentment, the players now feel the king's wrath after each lost conflict. Lack of support results in dishonor, which can be extinguished only with the help of the tower &ndash; an additional location to place knights during the game. At game's end, each player loses one point for each dishonor token held, and the players with the most and second most tokens lose additional points based on the total amount of dishonor dished out by the king during the game.<br/><br/>",

        "description": "Puerto Rico 1897 takes place the year after Puerto Rico achieved political autonomy and separated itself from the colonial Spanish government. In the game, you take on the role of an independent Puerto Rican farmer in this new era and compete against others to hire workers to grow, sell, and trade valuable crops. You will also be in charge of resurrecting parts of the country as you attempt to build vital city infrastructure. Your goal throughout the game is to acquire more wealth and prestige than your opponents and become the most prosperous farmer across the country. Each player has their own small board with spaces for city buildings, plantations, and resources. Shared between the players are three ships, a trading house, and a supply of resources and doubloons.<br/><br/>Puerto Rico 1897 uses a variable phase order mechanism in which a token is passed clockwise to the next player at the conclusion of a turn. The player with the token begins the round by choosing a role and taking the first action.The resource cycle of the game is that players grow crops that they exchange for points or doubloons. Doubloons can then be used to buy buildings, which allow players to produce more crops or give them other abilities. Buildings and plantations do not function unless they are staffed by workers.<br/><br/>During each round, players take turns selecting a role card from those on the table (such as &quot;Trader&quot; or &quot;Builder&quot;). When a role is chosen, every player gets to take the action associated with that role. The player who selected the role also receives a small privilege for doing so; for example, choosing the &quot;Builder&quot; role allows all players to construct a building, but the player who chose the role may do so at a discount on that turn. Unused roles gain a doubloon bonus at the end of each turn, and the next player who chooses that role gets to keep any doubloon bonus associated with it. This encourages players to make use of all the roles throughout a typical course of a game.<br/><br/>Players earn victory points for owning buildings, for shipping goods, and for occupied &quot;large buildings&quot;. Each player's accumulated shipping chips are kept face down and come in denominations of one or five. This prevents other players from being able to determine the exact score of another player.

This means that number &quot;rolls&quot; are evenly distributed according to its probability. The deck also represents the roll of one die (for use with the Cities and Knights Expansion).<br/><br/>To add an element of randomness to the dice deck, a New Year card is added on top of the bottom 5 cards. When this card is flipped, the deck is immediately shuffled again so 5 cards will not be used.<br/><br/>Regarding the events: sixteen cards do not have an associated event, the six &quot;7&quot; cards of course are associated to the &quot;Robber Attack&quot; event, and the rest of events only appear once (six events) or twice (4 events).<br/><br/>Belongs to the Catan Series.<br/><br/>Expands:<br/><br/>    CATAN<br/><br/><br/>The Event Cards are included in Catan Traders &amp; Barbarians.<br/><br/>",

Following the events of A Thousand Shapes of Horror, you have finally reached the Dreamlands, but it is not as you expected. No wondrous lands or fabulous cities greet you; merely the dark, barren realm of the Underworld. Perhaps those who brought stories of the Dreamlands to Arkham had never ventured this far underground, or perhaps this place can only be found by those who force their way in.

        "description": "From the website:<br/><br/>Cutthroat Caverns has often been described as a diceless RPG game and that has never been closer to the truth than with this expansion. For, introducing players to the devastatingly cruel new monsters, thought provoking additions to the Event deck and even more hugely powerful Relics, are two action-packed, full-on Adventure Modules.<br/><br/>Just living and having the most Prestige may no longer be enough to secure a win. And living is no easy matter. Ragnarok the End Bringer is aptly named. Greed allows any Attack card to be played as a Critical Miss. The Lich will turn fallen friends into fallen fiends. All that and you need to effect a rescue too.<br/><br/>Okay, that's what it says on the box... what's it really like?<br/><br/>Tombs and Tomes is our third expansion to Cutthroat Caverns and it takes the exciting new mechanics first introduced in Relics and Ruin and adds even more sinister fun to the mix of Events and Relic Cards. Try battling a familiar friend like the Cursed Goblin while the walls close in and your hand size shrinks every turn or have every Relic in the room suddenly come to life and attack you when the Encounter is over, where the first one to beat a Relic into submission may claim it.<br/><br/>And they are worth claiming. Bloodstone allows you to inflict 5 damage to any player at the end of an Encounter - and should any player die, you gain 3 Prestige. Or Ring of Storing which allows you to store an Action card immediately after playing it for a future second use. Perhaps Evil Eye is more your style, punishing those who would do you harm.<br/><br/>But what makes this set truly unique is a whole new way to play the game. Included within are two Adventure Modules, The Lady of Magtherium and Mad God's Maze. Yes, these are self guided (no gamemaster needed, you can all play) full blown adventure stories. Yes, they each have a unique plot and multiple possible endings. It is a 'choose your own path' styled module with decisions to make and consequences for your actions.<br/><br/>There is far more to it than in the base game of completing 9 Encounters. You must solve puzzles and avoid traps between the Encounters, decide marching order or who among you will take an action (and it may matter who), and determine through the course of your actions how the story will unfold. And in classic style, a big boss battle awaits you.<br/><br/>Moreover, there may be new winning or losing conditions. For example, in The Lady of Magtherium, you discover a noblewoman (an NPC) whom you must rescue to win. She won't fight, but can be hurt - and if she dies, you all lose.<br/><br/>Yes, these are one-shots and you will finish a module in a single sitting, so the modules themselves do not add to replay value. BUT they add so much depth and richness to the Encounters that when you sprinkle them into the regular game, they will be far more interesting. Of course, the real fun is that they represent what can be done with the game yourself. Creating and playing your own unique dungeon module is a great new way for fans to enjoy the game and we've got guidelines to get you started right here.<br/><br/>On another note, this set features a number of other winners in our Create an Encounter Contest. There are some major 'big bads' here folks. For those who felt that the game was &quot;too easy&quot; and that characters don't seem to die enough - well, all I can say is be careful what you wish for. There are 15 more vicious Encounters (bringing the total to 75!) and we can almost guarantee that unless you make an effort to work together, players are gonna die. A lot.<br/><br/>The stuff in this box is a helluva lot of fun to play and opens up a whole new world of possibilities! Check it out and see for yourself.<br/><br/>",

Each player starts with an identical set of twelve dice in their dice bag. At the start of the game, creature and spell dice (dubbed &quot;quarry&quot;) are dealt at random to form &quot;the Wilds&quot; in the center of the table. As play progresses, players roll their dice to attempt to summon creatures, cast spells, and harness the magical power of Quiddity (the in-game resource) to capture quarry from the Wilds to add to their repertoire and into their dice bag. Players draw and roll six dice a turn from their bag, meaning that controlling bag composition is key to victory.<br/><br/>Quarriors! is a fast-paced game in which players must strategically balance their choices each turn. Do you use your Quiddity to summon creatures in the hopes of scoring glory, or should you spend it all to capture more powerful quarry from the Wilds? Players must outmaneuver their opponents through strategic spell use, the acquisition of powerful quarry, and ultimately, by striking down opposing creatures in combat. If your creatures survive until your next turn, you will score glory points and move closer to victory!<br/><br/>Quarriors! Qultimate Quedition consists of the Quarriors! base game and all previously released expansions and promotional cards.<br/><br/>",

With new heroes like the Shaman, and the Bravo, along with cunning employees like the Loan Shark and the Henchman. It's a dangerous town, and you'll have to use all of your cunning and wits if you mean to make a profit out here!<br/><br/>Most importantly however, this expansion introduces a new Upgrade to Bargain Quest: The Black Market Upgrade<br/><br/>This Upgrade functions similarly like the Display and Storage Upgrades in the original game, however the cost to gain this upgrade is not coins, but *stars* which means you'll need to spend your hard earned reputation before you'll be able to make the connections you'll need to access the Black Market Deck!<br/><br/>During the Supply Step, a player with the Black Market Upgrade gains cards from the Black Market Deck, which contains a variety of strange and powerful artifacts!<br/><br/>The Black Market can be a bit unpredictable. Its items range from the incredibly powerful, to the expensive, but useless, to the outright weird. You'll want to keep the best equipment you find for yourself, and leave your opponents with less favorable options. Play your cards right and you'll be the next Capitalist Kingpin.<br/><br/>&mdash;description from the publisher<br/><br/>",

It's truly difficult to keep a Stalwart unit pinned for long!<br/><br/>Still, it's the Dwarfs that are the true stars of Hammer and Hold, and the expansion comes with enough Dwarf heroes and units to muster three full regiments.

Play a new race (the Bugs) or class (Space Ranger!), and do it all with Ralph, the Wonder Dog, by your side. Star Munchkin 2 -- The Clown Wars also has a new card type: Rooms.

The Dark Elves and Skaven each gain a hero and enough units to form a regiment, but the expansion's most fearsome threat comes in the form of its new Vampire Counts heroes and units, as well as the Fear and Reanimate X keywords they bear.<br/><br/>Units with Fear sow panic among their foes, limiting their abilities to fight back. So long as a unit with Fear is pinning an enemy, the panicked foe's counterattack value becomes one.<br/><br/>As a focus ability, your unit with Reanimate X can choose an Undead disk in your casualty pile and reinforce it onto the battlefield completely within short range. The size of the disk that you can Reanimate depends upon the value of X. It reinforces without an activation token, but instead receives a reanimate token and is returned to the casualty pile during the end phase.<br/><br/>Naturally, Legions of Darkness features enough dread necromancy to tempt even the most casual of players with the awesome powers available to those who can manipulate the very essences of life and death. Vampire Counts command cards heavily reward Casters, as do those for the Dark Elves, Skaven, Orcs, and Chaos.<br/><br/>",

        "description": "EPIC Napoleonics is the sixth expansion for GMT&rsquo;s Commands &amp; Colors Napoleonics game system. EPIC Napoleonics allows for fighting larger battles with more units. EPIC Napoleonics is actually two game systems in one &ndash; the Epic Battles system, and the La Grande Battles system. Although the scope of our Napoleonic game has changed size wise, the historical feel and the basic rules of play, for the most part, remain the same. To experience the maximum enjoyment with these two new Napoleonic game formats, both EPIC Napoleonics and La Grande Battles scenarios are best played using the Command card and Tactician card decks that were part of the Generals, Marshals and Tacticians expansion.<br/><br/>Included in this expansion are six standard sized scenarios that focus on key phases of the battle of Austerlitz, 2 December 1805. This expansion also features 12 EPIC sized engagements and two La Grande Battle scenarios. Also included are two double-sided mounted maps. The EPIC sided battlefield is larger, and at 11 hexes deep by 20 hexes wide, it is almost double the size of the standard size battlefield of 9 hexes deep by 13 hexes wide. When laid side-by-side to form the La Grande battlefield, the battle area is a whopping 11 hexes deep by 26 hexes wide.<br/><br/>In an EPIC Napoleonics game, one player on each side assumes the role of the Commander In Chief (CIC). Each CIC has a hand of Command cards and on a turn must play one card from his hand to order units in one section of the EPIC battlefield. Also on the turn, the CIC must select one card from the Courier rack to play. The card selected from the Courier rack will also order units in one section of the EPIC battlefield. There are only three sections in the EPIC battlefield (left, center and right) and with two Command cards played each turn, the action quickly becomes very fast and furious.<br/><br/>The Courier rack is a new game mechanic, and starts each battle with five Command cards that are visible to both players. Each turn one card is taken from the rack, so the choice of cards a player has each turn is reduced, until there are only two cards remaining on the rack. The rack is then filled back to five cards before the next player&rsquo;s turn, and the card selection process from the Courier rack will start again.<br/><br/>EPIC Napoleonic will allow two or more players to enjoy a truly Epic size battle, but it is important to note in order to play most EPIC Napoleonic scenarios, players will need a copy of the Commands &amp; Colors Napoleonic game and its expansions (Spanish, Russian, Austrian, Prussian and Generals, Marshals and Tacticians) This EPIC Napoleonic expansion will only provide enough units and terrain to fill any gaps.<br/><br/>",

        "description": "When she was an infant, Evelyn Moore&rsquo;s parents turned to the U.S. government for help. Their daughter couldn&rsquo;t talk yet, but she &ldquo;spoke&rdquo; to machines. More alarmingly, when she did, they fell into their components, which created a metallic cocoon for the child. None of this was covered by the parenting classes the Moore family had attended. A representative of a group called the Ironclad Project offered to take care of Evelyn, but only if her parents were willing to sign her over to the care of the project. Seeing no other option, they agreed, and Evelyn became the ward of the Ironclad Project.<br/><br/>Years went by, and Evelyn grew, learning to control her powers. She was told that she was being trained to be a part of the army. A new army that fought with better power instead of hundreds of soldiers. However, her lack of control and her hot-headedness meant that the Ironclad Project had little use for her. She had learned to absorb tech to plate herself in steel and coat her skin in wires, talking to the tech as easily as she talked to herself, but it wasn&rsquo;t enough. Even though she desperately wanted to prove her worth, those monitoring her kept wanting more than she could give.<br/><br/>Then, one day, she absorbed a tank.<br/><br/>There had been talk of military training going on in the adjacent facility, and Evelyn wanted to know more. Sneaking past her monitors, she found herself next to a massive M1 Abrams tank. It spoke to her of cold steel and internal combustion. It sounded beautiful to her. So she let it fall into its pieces, and she wore its skin.<br/><br/>All hell broke loose in the army base. A tank had just fallen apart, and a person-shaped pile of plate-steel walked out of the wreckage. Soldiers opened fire on the figure, who ran through a wall, disappearing into the nearby hills.<br/><br/>Since then, Choke has been a regular opponent of the Freedom Five and their allies. She is frequently at the heart of troubles concerning military installations or stockpiles of weapons. It was hardly surprising that she ended up allying with the Vengeful Five when Baron Blade called. But when she was fatally wounded by K.N.Y.F.E., many believed that would be the end of Choke.<br/><br/>However, Choke had heard a peculiar voice - unlike any she had heard before. The Freedom Five had recently prevented Deadline from destroying the earth, and the alien&rsquo;s odd device was still housed in their headquarters. And she could hear its voice. It could save her, and she could give it purpose once again.<br/><br/>Evelyn drew the resonating crystal at the heart of the device into herself, sealing her wound, but also opening her mind to the powers of the alien tech. It could sense weak points. She was originally trained to save the world, and now she knew how. She would show those at Project Ironclad that she was worthwhile after all. Using her new knowledge, she would erase all the weak points from the world. All she needed was a bit more power&hellip;<br/><br/>With the necessary elements right at hand, Chokepoint was born. Taking power from the tech of the heroes around her, Evelyn is on a self-appointed quest to destroy the weak points of the world, and beyond.<br/><br/>Chokepoint&rsquo;s scope is without limit. She already has growing concerns that the star at the center of this galaxy will eventually die or explode, and that getting rid of it sooner rather than later might be necessary&hellip;<br/><br/>Chokepoint is a mini-expansion given as a pre-order bonus for Sentinels of the Multiverse: Villains of the Multiverse.<br/><br/>",

Most importantly, she has the ability to land a deathblow to any General just when the heroes think all is lost.<br/><br/>&bull; Chaos Wizard: The Chaos Wizard is able to cast powerful spells, but the untamed magic that he uses will not only lay waste to the invading minions, but can also wound himself and other heroes, or destroy the land he is working to protect if not kept in check.<br/><br/>&bull; Adventurer: The Adventurer holds a magical item from previous quests that gives her great ability in card management. Additionally, her questing experience enables her to complete a minor quest for Hero cards each time she ends her turn on a location with a Treasure Chest and grants an advantage on major quests. Couple all this with her ability to mingle with lowlifes of the Inns and she can be a powerful defender of the realm.<br/><br/>",

But The Big Geeky Box will eventually run out of space, especially when you sleeve all the cards. Now The Bigger Geekier Box was designed to hold even more sets than The Big Geeky Box. It has four long troughs that can hold dozens of decks each and a closeable token holder, the previously-released Geeks and Smash Up All Stars factions with their corresponding bases. Also, unlike the Big Geeky Box, this set contains a comprehensive rule book compiling all the rules and card clarifications from all the sets created so far. The set also comes with dividers that name every faction made thus far and for Oops, You Did It Again. To accommodate partly full troughs, the box includes foam bricks that can be positioned anywhere along the troughs and will remain in place.<br/><br/>&mdash;description from the publisher<br/><br/>",

(In Japanese, hanabi is written as 花火; these are the ideograms flower and fire, respectively.)<br/><br/>The card deck consists of five different colors of cards, numbered 1&ndash;5 in each color. For each color, the players try to place a row in the correct order from 1&ndash;5. Sounds easy, right? Well, not quite, as in this game you hold your cards so that they're visible only to other players. To assist other players in playing a card, you must give them hints regarding the numbers or the colors of their cards. Players must act as a team to avoid errors and to finish the fireworks display before they run out of cards.<br/><br/>Hanabi Deluxe II is similar to the Hanabi Deluxe edition first released in 2013, which features the same gameplay as the original game, but with the cards being replaced by Mah Jhong-style tiles. Hanabi Deluxe II includes six unique tiles that comprise the &quot;Master Artisan&quot; expansion.<br/><br/>",

        "description": "With the power and splendor of Egypt increasing, its influence now reaches far beyond its borders. Seth, the god of conflict, demands that you subdue Canaan, and wage war on the mighty Hittite Empire. Your soldiers are to march on any land that dares defy you or pose a threat to your kingdom. It is the time to muster your armies, gather your priests, claim mighty artifacts and secure the favor of a powerful cult to pave your way into even greater victories.<br/><br/>Tekhenu: Time of Seth adds new layers of interaction and new options to Tekhenu: Obelisk of the Sun. A new board opens up options of conquering neighboring lands to receive in-game benefits, as well as new scoring opportunities. New dice allow for mustering Soldiers and gathering priests. However, conquest comes with a price, as with more battles fought, balancing one's deeds becomes more complicated than before.<br/><br/>Apart from soldiers needed to take control of lands beyond the borders of Egypt, players also gather priests that allow them to take control of artifacts. These new cards offer new and nuanced ways of planning turns, combining strategic plays and scoring victory points.<br/><br/>The expansion also contains advanced rules specifically designed to enhance the 2&ndash;player experience.<br/><br/>&mdash;description from the publisher<br/><br/>",

Other tribes are on their way as well!<br/><br/>You can combine this mini expansion with the basic game as well as with all other expansions. First, you set up the game as usual. You shuffle all 16 bonus tiles and place them face down next to the game board. The stand-up figure Mammoth herd is placed next to the pile. You are now ready to start the game. The game play stays the same except for the following changes.<br/><br/>At the beginning of each round, the start player places the mammoth herd on the resource shown by the top-most bonus tile. For example, if the tile shows a brick, the start player puts the mammoth herd into the clay pit. Then, he/she picks the first bonus tile and places it face up next to the pile. (The resource that is now shown is of no importance in this round.) If there are no bonus tiles left, the whole herd is tamed. In this case, you remove the mammoth herd and continue playing according to the normal rules. You place your people as usual. Only in the phase in which you use the actions of your people figures, the mammoth herd becomes important. When you have people placed on the resource on which the mammoth herd stays, you roll the dice as usual and take your resources. Immediately after this, you may move one or more people from the resource where the mammoth herd is placed to the bonus tile that was turned over. With these people figures, you can try to tame a mammoth later in order to have help for your work. You are only allowed to move people figures from this resource production area, and you immediately have to pay 1 food for each people figure you place on the bonus tile. You may - as it is the case for feeding - substitute 1 food with 1 resource. People figures that are not placed on the bonus tile must be taken back to the player board. After all players have used the actions of their people, but before the feeding, you tame 1 mammoth from the mammoth herd.<br/><br/>All players who moved people to the bonus tile roll the dice. Each player uses as many dice as he has people on the bonus tile. All players roll the dice at the same time. Now, you compare the score of your highest single die. (You do not add all dice together as usual, and you are not allowed to use tools.) The player with the highest single die score wins and takes the &quot;1.&quot; bonus. He may also, instead, take the &quot;all&quot; bonus. Then all the other players, participating in the taming, take the &quot;all&quot; bonus. Then, the winner takes the tile and places it face down in front of himself. (The O on the back is not for the player. It just serves as a reminder for the final scoring). When the highest die scores are level, the players compare the next lower score, etc.<br/><br/>If there is still a draw after comparing all results, all players involved get the &quot;all&quot; bonus.<br/> The tile has to be put back into the box. If nobody has placed a people figure on the bonus tile, nobody gets the bonus. The tile has to be put into the box as well. Before you score the civilization cards, there is the mammoth scoring. The player with the most bonus tiles gets 10 points. In the case of a draw, all players involved get these points.<br/><br/>",

Both Bliss and Gloom are important for the health of Cerebria, and Balance seeks a way for them to coexist in harmony.<br/><br/>The Forces of Balance expansion extends the world of Cerebria by adding a third side to the game with two new Spirits; unpredictable Intuition and wise Reason. The Balance game mode makes it possible for six players to play at once, and it also works for fewer numbers of players.<br/><br/>The Balance side has also some new mechanics. Their Emotions, the way they Invoke Emotions, gain Essence or Fortify are all uniquely tied to the playstyle of Balance.<br/><br/>Balance players have their own method to gather final scores during the game. They do not compete for the Common Aspiration. Instead, they have a Hidden Aspiration with two equivalent conditions.  Just like Bliss and Gloom, Balance wins by having the most points at the end of the game from Identity Fragments and the Wheel of Intentions.<br/><br/>&mdash;description from the publisher<br/><br/>",

        "description": "Note: This entry is for compilations that contain both The Game and The Game on Fire<br/><br/>Players in The Game try to discard all 98 cards in the deck onto four discard piles in order to win, but they need to do so in the right ways.<br/><br/>Each player starts with 6-8 cards in hand depending on the number of players, and four discard pile prompt cards are on the table: two showing &quot;1&quot; and an up arrow and two showing &quot;100&quot; and a down arrow. On a turn, a player must discard at least two cards from hand onto one or more discard piles, with cards on the 1 piles being placed in ascending order and cards on the 100 piles being placed in descending order. One tricky aspect to play is that you can play a card exactly 10 higher/lower than the top card of a discard pile even when you would normally have to play in a descending/ascending order, e.g., if a 100 discard pile is topped with an 87, you can play any card lower than 87 or you can play the 97.<br/><br/>After a player finishes their turn, they refill their hand from the deck. During play, players cannot reveal exact numbers in their hands, but they can warn others not to play on certain discard piles or otherwise make play suggestions.<br/><br/>Once the deck is emptied, players are required only to play at least one card on a turn. If you play all 98 cards, you win! If you get good, the rules suggest that you play at least three cards a turn to increase the challenge.<br/><br/>The German NSV edition of The Game on Fire is a special version of The Game packaged in a tin with a playmat and an &quot;On Fire&quot; mini-expansion. This expansion consists of six flaming cards (22, 33, 44, 55, 66, 77) that replace the regular cards, and when one of these fire cards is played onto a pile, that card must be covered by the end of the next player's turn or else players have lost the game.<br/><br/>The U.S. edition of The Game on Fire will have the six flaming cards in the box in place of the other cards, and it won't contain the playmat.<br/><br/>",

        "description": "The Battles of Khalkhin-Gol, the first installment in Days of Wonder's second series of Memoir '44 Battle Maps, offers a campaign of six standard scenarios that can be enhanced with the two pre-printed Breakthrough battles provided in this expansion.<br/><br/>In more detail, The Battles of Khalkhin-Gol is a series of battles fought along the Halha River (Khalkhin-Gol) on the Soviet-Japanese border at the very beginning of World War II. The Japanese Sixth Army was facing the Soviet 57th Special Corps, including Mongolian cavalry. At first, the battles were only short skirmishes, but it soon escalated into open war. The whole campaign lasted five months and ended with a Soviet victory. The six standard scenarios of this expansion can be played separately or as a campaign, with each scenario outcome impacting the following one. The pre-printed Breakthrough scenarios &mdash; Bain Tsagan Heights and Tightening the Noose &mdash; can be played in the campaign as well as one of the two Overlord scenarios, Encirclement at Khalkhin-Gol.<br/><br/>The second Overlord scenario, Cape Torokina Landings, highlights the fierce battle for Cape Torokina between U.S. Marines and Japanese forces that took place years later; therefore, it is not part of the campaign.<br/><br/>This expansion also includes six Soviet BA-10 Armored Cars and six Japanese Type 97 Te-Ke tankettes that players will find useful for many of the scenarios included.<br/><br/>The Battles of Khalkhin-Gol is designed for 2 to 8 players. Each oversized map is ready-to-play with all terrain, obstacles, and unit positions pre-printed so players can simply add the figures and play. The various scenarios of the expansion require one copy of Memoir '44 (two for the Overlord scenarios), as well as the Terrain Pack, Eastern Front, and Pacific Theater expansions. The Equipment Pack and Winter Wars expansions are also recommended.<br/><br/>&mdash;description from the publisher<br/><br/>",

After heading Upstalk and passing through The Spaces Between, it's time to land on the moon. First Contact shakes up the contests between Corp and Runner by introducing three new region upgrades, mythic ice, new traps, resources, and a new Anarch identity. The Data Pack's sixty cards (three copies each of twenty different cards) also depict a new meat space where gravity is low, people all wear spacesuits, there's only one fully established city, and everything is enclosed. Confined. Watched.<br/><br/>From the remotest edges of Port Anson Grid to the seedy underbelly of Duggar's, First Contact immerses players in a strange and alien setting in which there are very few places the game's Corps don't control completely, everything you thought you knew is just a shade different, and it's all that much more important to find someone to guide you through your ongoing cyberstruggles...<br/><br/>",

Complete the journeys they prepare for us. We will serve and be gifted.<br/><br/>That is the call of the abyss.&quot; &mdash;N&agrave;dair<br/><br/>The Revive: Call of the Abyss expansion introduces the mysterious life form Scyphoz, which lives in the giant lakes that are formed by meltwater from the glaciers. By building near lakes, you gain devotion points, which let you access the new and powerful Scyphoz cards. You can also use the switch action to initiate journeys, sending out your citizen on missions to gain more devotion points.<br/><br/>Aside from 16 Scyphoz cards, 18 journey cards, 3 lakes, and the devotion track, this expansion contains 15 new machine tokens, 9 slot modules, 9 new citizen cards, and four new tribes, with all of the content (other then the Cordycephians tribe) being compatible with solo play. The four new tribe boards feature only an advanced side, and each has its own unique rules, advanced abilities, and technologies:<br/><br/><br/>    The KAIROS have two modes &mdash; day and night &mdash; and their abilities depend on the current mode. Switching between the two modes at the right time is crucial to this tribe's success.<br/><br/><br/><br/>    The GIB'WARKS has access to powerful gadgets that boost their switch actions, and they may unlock more gadgets for even more flexibility. Their tribe ability lets them reset their switch, which is powerful because the switch action is even more important now that it lets you initiate journeys.<br/><br/><br/><br/>    The OSTARIUS build huge gates which they can switch on and off, either helping or hindering other players. Gates require quite some space, but if placed well, OSTARIUS may temporarily block off parts of the game board, possibly securing them for themselves.<br/><br/><br/><br/>    The CORDYCEPHIANS leech other players, taking advantage of their cards, their buildings, and even their technologies. The CORDYCEPHIANS must therefore adapt their strategy to the opponents they are facing.<br/><br/><br/>&mdash;description from the publisher<br/><br/>",

Now careless heroes can twist and storm everything around them to make their situation even more interesting.<br/><br/>Stormy Winds includes new monsters and equipment, a new sorceress heroine, an ancient greek god as the Boss, and new maps with special rooms. You can accumulate experience points as in a real fantasy game, and power cards allow you to activate devastating air powers, such as the &quot;Chain Lightning&quot; spell, but beware the new monster flying ability! You will fight using the air elemental die and, of course, make new &quot;impossible&quot; die rolls!<br/><br/>",

Formula 90: Expansion #2 – Barcelona and Silverstone.<br/><br/>Race! Formula 90 is a car-racing game simulating all the typical elements of a motor sport event: car strategies, weather changes, pit stops, tire management, overtaking, doubling, and of course damages and crashes.<br/><br/>In Race! every game turn represents one or more laps of the track, and each player is in control of only one car. Other cars, called robots, move automatically on the track fighting between them and the human players. Players are provided with a set of racing cards and a car chart to keep track of all available resources (tires, damages, reliability). By playing racing cards, they move along the track and in so doing they spend resources. Movement can be affected by trajectories on the track, straight, corner and braking sections, opponents and other special events like yellow or blue flags.<br/><br/>Strategies and driving skills are another key element of the game. Players must exploit these unique capabilities to gain against competitors while adapting their driving style to the actual race conditions. When using a strategy at his best, a player achieves a &quot;special&quot;, which allows him to draw a track card, which is usually more powerful than ordinary racing cards.<br/><br/>This new edition of Race! Formula 90 differs from the original game with a new streamlined set of rules, better balanced strategies and skills, a companion rulebook with optional rules for shorter races, alternative weather system, new type of robot and a different race finish.<br/>All tracks completely redesigned and are circa 20% larger in size<br/>Strategy cards instead of tiles with rule reminders on the back<br/>A general improvement in components.<br/><br/>",

To succeed, the parties of adventurers need to be better equipped than ever before...<br/><br/>Luxor: The Mummy's Curse contains four different expansion modules that can be combined in any combination with the Luxor base game. It also includes the necessary pieces to play with five players. The modules give players special powers, unique starting hands, and new ways to collect sets of treasures. Most importantly, it contains a cursed mummy that players must avoid lest they suffer the consequences. The modules in more detail are:<br/><br/>&bull; The Mummy: An ancient cursed mummy has woken and is not amused at the adventurers intruding on her temple. Whenever an Osiris card is played by any player, the mummy moves forward as many spaces as the number of eyes on the card. Any adventurer she lands on or passes through falls into a deep slumber and must be woken up by spending an activation. The player controlling the mummy receives Talisman tokens that grant them a one-time special ability.<br/><br/>&bull; Equipment: Players choose their starting hands from five of seven equipment cards. Once played, the equipment cards are discarded as normal and will be shuffled into the deck. Each equipment card is a variation of the normal movement cards and allows players to choose a starting strategy.<br/><br/>&bull; New Treasures: A fourth treasure type is added to the game, along with new rules for set collection.<br/><br/>&bull; Special Adventurers: Each player chooses from one of eight special abilities that are unique to them for the entire game.<br/><br/>",

This curse uses the new &quot;crystal Discovery cards&quot; instead of the normal discovery cards to offer fresh challenges. You discover these new cards and move forward until no crystal discovery cards are available, then the game ends. Now it's time to see whether you've broken the curse or not...<br/><br/>&bull; Prodigy mode: In this game mode, your explorers are incredibly talented, so you start with five additional action cards. This not only increases your stack, but allows you to take further actions. The powerful cards show multiple achievements, key words, and skills to strengthen your powers, to make actions easier, to activate character skills, and to protect you!<br/><br/>&bull; Immortal Mode: Not everyone can survive, and some get queasy when they see the rapidly shrinking stack of action cards. If you are one of them, this mode is for you!<br/><br/>How does it work? Very simple: Put the medallion in your backpack at the start of the adventure, and if you fail due to an unexpected turn of fate, you only have to wait for the magic. You're already in the middle of an adventure again, but maybe not quite as you imagined it... The medallion should not be misused as eternal life has a high price. How high? Well, you have to find out for yourself. All you have to do is die!<br/><br/>&bull; &quot;There is a traitor among us!&quot; Mode: Before the start of the game, randomly draw one of the seven fate cards and look at them in secret. Four of them are &quot;Don't trust anyone!&quot; cards and have no effect for the time being. The other three, however, are &quot;The Continent Demands a Victim!&quot; cards that give you only two options: murder an explorer at the best possible time, or die...in a cruel way!<br/><br/>And as if that weren't enough, the impact of each fate card is different, so you never know what to expect when you meet your friends &mdash; or your victims.<br/><br/>You do not need this expansion if you already have the What Goes Up, Must Come Down collector's edition (white box) from the Kickstarter campaign.<br/><br/>",

The last phase is an income phase in which players gain money from the shops and parking lots if they are supplied with electricity.<br/><br/>The bigger and higher your city is, the more victory points players will have at the end of the game, which lasts ten rounds &ndash; but do not forget to provide electricity to all your flats, shops, and lifts to make them more efficient.<br/><br/><br/>Changes in the fourth edition:<br/><br/>Has a new alternative (two by four) map printed on the reverse of the boards.<br/><br/>Contains the Central Park solo board, previously released separately as the Manhattan t-shirt, on the back of the central board.<br/><br/>Has a bigger box that now fits all the cubes comfortably, and has space for expansions.<br/><br/>Has a bigger rulebook, in separate languages, with updated rules, including rules for up to 8 players to play together by combining two sets of the game.<br/><br/>16 player cubes in 8 colors in each box to allow for games with more than 4 players, by combining 2 copies of Town Center.<br/><br/>Revamped player maps with wider streets that are compatible with future planned expansions.<br/><br/>Added central board with a track around it, a simpler method to track income and points.<br/><br/>Improved player aid that now includes Phase V (in Editions 1&ndash;3, Phases IV and V were both encompassed in Phase IV) and more detail in Phase I explanation.<br/><br/>Doubled the size of the cloth bag - now all cubes can all be stored in it without spilling out, and there's space for enough cubes for 5-8 players to be pulled from it.<br/><br/>Note: You need two copies of the same edition* (or a copy of the 3rd edition and a copy of the 4th edition) to play with up to 8 players. Each copy contains enough building cubes and player boards for up to 4 players.<br/><br/>* 3rd and 4th edition are the only 2 editions with the same size of cubes. 1st edition's much smaller cubes, 2nd editions LEGO bricks, and Deluxe edition's way larger cubes are not compatible with the 3rd and 4th edition cubes; the 5&ndash;8-player rules require all players to select their cubes from the same draft towers.<br/><br/>",

        "description": "The first expansion to Dirk Henn's Shogun.<br/><br/>The Daimyos (military lords) are still fighting over the distribution of the empire&rsquo;s provinces while peasant revolts and famines do not encourage ruling the country. But none other than the disempowered Tenno (Emperor) might tip the scales for some of the sovereigns. Ensuring the favor of the Tenno by using your diplomatic skills will help you win precious gifts and highly rated privileges. But be careful: If you vie too much for the Tenno&rsquo;s favor you might easily lose control of your armies...<br/><br/>This expansion increases the strategical depth of the basic game by allowing players to visit the imperial court. Players can convert their armies (either from the tower tray or their provinces) to court officials and send them to the imperial court to acquire favors from the Emperor.<br/><br/>It also includes the Samurai mini-expansion, which can be used with the base game in combination with Tenno's Court or on its own. With this mini-expansion, each player receives a stack of cards showing progressively better bonuses. If a player controls provinces in at least four regions at the beginning of a round, they can reveal the next card in their stack and select one of the bonuses depicted on it.<br/><br/>",

With more than 40 miniatures and 70 different types of villains, it takes the cooperative campaign content beyond 100 hours of unique gameplay, and adds a new Combat Role to multiply the possibilities in PvP and Co-op matches.<br/><br/>The PvP Game Modes (Capture the Orb, Tournament, Team Competition) become richer with the addition of the Commanders and their respective Companions. With a second miniature on the board, this new Combat Role (8th in total) brings to the table interesting and varied strategical and tactical novelties, and teambuilding synergies.<br/><br/>The game's Co-op/Campaign Mode now develops in a semi-open world, where players can consult an Adventure Map and decide where they want to go next, instead of being linearly directed by the story.<br/><br/>The Campaign runs in Cycles, each with three phases: City Phase, Journey Phase, and Quest Phase.<br/><br/>In the City Phase, players have the opportunity to buy items, rest, and develop sidequests related to City Structures (that can be upgraded), Relics (rewards obtained by completing a Quest, that initiate optional story arcs with a puzzle vibe), and others.<br/><br/>In the Journey Phase, players read a prelude related to the region they want to visit, in connection with the overall story, and prepare for the Quest, by studying what they may face (this changes according to Story Facts unlocked), assigning tasks to Assets (helpful NPCs that join the team as the story progresses), equipping items, and more.<br/><br/>Finally, in the Quest Phase, the game board is assembled and dozens of different villains may be faced. The dungeon crawling and replayability vibe is heightened by the addition of random encounters, secret rooms with previously unknown content, events and interactions that require tough decisions during the mission, and more.<br/><br/>All your decisions matter and significantly impact the Quests&rsquo; gameplay, modifying even the circumstances of the multi-part epic final mission, and determines the Boss (or Bosses) you might face, in an exciting campaign with multiple endings.<br/><br/>-description from publisher<br/><br/>",

        "description": "Combat Commander: Battle Pack #6 &ndash; Sea Lion is the sixth themed collection of scenarios for use with the Combat Commander series of games. The theme of this Battle Pack carries forward from BP #5 and presents a what if situation of a successful invasion of Great Britain.  The early and successful conclusion to the Battle of Britain allows the Luftwaffe to dominate the skies over southern England and the Channel Ports of Southampton and Portsmouth.   The actions represented in the battle pack cover the period of late September thru December 1940 and showcase the initial invasion, the Axis advance towards London, its eventual capture, the early entry of the United States into the war, and finally the British counter offensive, Operation Tremor, to drive the hated enemy from its shores.  CC-Sea Lion features ten new scenarios printed on card stock and ten new maps.<br/><br/>Players will find scenario special rules to cover such topics as:<br/><br/>&bull; Airdrops (both Fallschirmj&auml;ger and supplies)<br/>&bull; Prison Breaks<br/>&bull; British Fascist uprisings<br/>&bull; Targeted Sniper Attacks<br/>&bull; Partisan attacks on German Rear Areas<br/>&bull; Alternative night rules for Opportunity Fire<br/><br/><br/>The new maps depict specific locations in southern England, several of which the designer has personally visited.  The player will get to fight over critical areas such as Portsmouth, the Medway River, Trafalgar Square and Holloway Prison in London, and the Port of Dover.  Can you command the troops at your disposal to crush the British spirit and win the war for Germany or muster the remnants of the forces rescued from Dunkirk and the Home Guard to repel the invader and send him back across the Channel?  Operation Sea Lion is active and commences now.<br/><br/>",

The Big Box contains the award-winning Isle of Skye base game (Kennerspiel des Jahres 2016), the Druids expansion, and additional scoring and tunnel tiles. A new addition is the mini-expansion Randgebiete.<br/><br/>In the game, you embody one leader of each of the five traditional Scottish clans. You create your own small empire in order to gain the necessary victory points. But in each game only four of the included 24 score cards are in play. This makes each game different and requires different tactics and strategies.<br/><br/>In each round you can buy one of the tiles of a fellow player. Face down, all players simultaneously set the prices of the pieces they offer. A high price can lead to prosperity and much needed money. However, if no buyer can be found, the seller must add the tile to his empire himself and give up the money he has invested. In the end, the player who has scored the most victory points wins.<br/><br/>&mdash;description from the publisher (translated)<br/><br/>The &quot;Randgebiete&quot;/ borderland-expansion is a module, that can be added to any game, alone or together with the expansions.<br/><br/>Every player starts with the same 6 borderland tiles in their supply. There are two tiles each of water, mountain and land.<br/>Each of them has only two sides for connections and two already closed borders.<br/>In each round, when you place your other tiles, you may also place one borderland tile connected to at least one other tile. If its connected to other tiles on both sides, it gets flipped to the better side with more scoring symbols (like cows, sheep) on it.<br/>No tile may be placed touching one of the other two sides with closed borders.<br/><br/>",

The tiles depict the town Carcassonne itself, which is visited by the Count. When a player places a tile that causes scoring for other players but not for themselves, they may put a follower in one of the four regions of the city.  They may also move the Count to a region, imprisoning all followers in that region.  Each region corresponds to a scoring method, and when a feature of that type is scored, the player may move their follower to that feature, to share in the scoring or even prevent another player from scoring! This expansion requires the basic Carcassonne game, and can be combined with any of the other expansions.

Many great scientists, with their theories and ideas, changed and shaped our perception of the universe: Galileo Galilei, Copernicus, Kepler, Bacon and, above all, Sir Isaac Newton.<br/><br/>In Newton, the players take the role of a young scientist who wants to become one of the great geniuses of this era. To reach their ultimate goal, they travel around Europe, visit universities and cities, study to discover new theories, build new tools and work to earn money.<br/><br/>The game is played over six rounds. Each round, every player plays five cards from their hand, and each played card allows the player to perform one of the many actions of the game. An action can have a variety of effects, which depend on the symbols on the board. At the end of the round, a player can take back all the cards except for one. One card has to remain on the board, which means that you give up one possibility of doing that action, but also that that very action will be carried out with greater strength. Fortunately, you can acquire new cards with additional powers to perform more actions.<br/><br/>After six rounds, you calculate your final score, and the player with the most VP wins.<br/><br/>&mdash;description from the publisher<br/><br/>",

        "description": "From Fantasy Flight Games:<br/>we have developed an expansion to the AGoT LCG Core Set, and we&rsquo;re calling it the: Kings of the Sea. Kings of the Sea was developed with three major goals in mind:<br/><br/>The first of these goals was to bring House Greyjoy back into the LCG environment. From this perspective, the expansion consists of a Greyjoy deck that is similar to the out-of-the-box decks that you&rsquo;ll find in the AGoT Core set. With a mixture of both new cards and old school Greyjoy reprints (some modified and updated for the LCG environment), House Greyjoy can once again stand proudly alongside (or, if you prefer, against) Houses Stark, Lannister, Baratheon, and Targaryen in the LCG environment.<br/><br/>Secondly, I insisted on using the design of the Kings of the Sea expansion as an opportunity to address some of the context and synergy concerns noted earlier. In this product, you&rsquo;ll find numerous King and Queen characters, some new Kingdom locations, and a spattering of Military Battle, Intrigue Gambit, and Power Struggle plot cards. Additional use for crested characters is also prevalent (particularly Holy and War), and a major black hole in the AGoT LCG metagame, a realistic check on powerful locations, has been confronted.<br/><br/>Third (and not unrelated to the context and synergy discussion), we wanted this expansion to have something for everyone, even if they&rsquo;re not at all interested in House Greyjoy. Thus, each House gets at least 1 King or Queen, and the plot deck (with the exception of an important House Greyjoy only plot reprint) along with many of the neutral cards were selected as cards that could potentially be useful building blocks in the widest possible array of decks. So even a die-hard Lannister player (there aren&rsquo;t really any of those out there, are there?) should be able to find something of use in this set.<br/><br/>",

Each expansion can be played separately or in combination with any other.<br/><br/>The Fair Youth expansion adds an additional deduction task to the game: you must discover where in London the Fair Youth is hiding. Bystanders will give you a clue for which way the Youth went from your current location, but if you are already at his actual location you will be told a lie. Deduce his location to surprise him there, or for extra points catch him and the Dark Lady together, unmasking them both at the same time.<br/><br/>The Rendezvous challenges you to discover which of seven landscape features acted as a meeting place for Shakespeare and his Dark Lady. Querying a location gives you a number from 1 to 3, being the number of steps away from the current location that the Rendezvous symbol can be found. Deduce which map symbol represents the Rendezvous, then confront and unmask the Dark Lady in a location with that symbol at it.<br/><br/>The Rival Poet adds a second pawn that stalks the streets and interacts with the player via simple movement rules. Choose from two different poets to make the game easier or harder. The Elusive Poet tries to stay one step ahead of you, but if you catch him he will reveal a clue about the Dark Lady. In contrast, The Aggressive Poet hounds and chases you, potentially spoiling your plans to intercept the Dark Lady.<br/><br/>Waypoints and Traces gives you two tools to mark and track the Dark Lady's location at a particular point in the stealth deck. And The Darker Ladies replace the clue cards in the base game, giving each Dark Lady a new set of characteristics and presenting a slightly harder deduction challenge.<br/><br/>&mdash;description from the designer<br/><br/>",

        "description": "From the publisher's web site:<br/><br/>Attack!: Expansion will add quite a bit of detail while retaining playability.  Players will be able to choose from many new options including (They will get 3 per turn): Moving Military Units, Playing Political Cards, Attempting a Diplomatic Blitz, Beginning a Trade Route Auction, Purchasing Units, Researching a New Technology, Trading with another Player, or a Strategic Move (Land, Sea, or Air).<br/><br/>Politics: Each player nation and each minor nation will have one of the four political affiliations: Fascist, Monarchy, Democracy, or Communism. Political cards will allow the players to influence the minor nations governments with propaganda, or even overthrow them in an attempt to install a friendly government that they can then influence to join their &quot;sphere&quot;. Other diplomatic cards will allow players to spy on each other or perform various internal political actions.<br/><br/>Trade Routes: Players will be able to bid on Trade Route cards. The highest bidder gets the card. Trade cards act just like any other economic card, except they are &quot;wild cards&quot; and may be used to create sets. They also usually have higher than normal economic values. The downside to Trade Route cards is that they may be blocked or destroyed by blockades or Submarine warfare.<br/><br/>Technology: After the initial expansion, players usually begin to build alliances and the wars begin. Having a technology that gives you an advantage on the battlefield is critical. Players may spend an action (and money) attempting to develop a special technology.<br/><br/>Oil: Oil also takes on its historical importance in Attack!: Expansion. Every time a player moves tank, air, or naval units, they must spend oil units from their reserve. The oil reserve may only be replenished when oil cards are used to do so rather than used in a player's economy that turn.<br/><br/>Attack! and Attack!: Expansion will contain the same quality art and components featured in other Eagle-Gryphon Games products.<br/><br/>Expands:<br/><br/>    Attack!<br/><br/><br/>Parts Manifest:<br/><br/>     Game board (Eastern Hemisphere)<br/>     Rule book (20 pages)<br/>     6 sets of 60 pieces each in red, deep blue, dark green, grey, tan, taupe (submarines, destroyers, battleships, aircraft carriers)<br/>         16 Destroyers<br/>         24 Submarines<br/>         10 Battleships<br/>         10 Aircraft Carriers<br/>    <br/>     90 government type counters<br/>     48 Economics Cards<br/>         Factories (2&times;1, 3&times;2, 2&times;3, 1&times;4)<br/>         Minerals (2&times;1, 3&times;2, 2&times;3, 1&times;4)<br/>         Oil (2&times;1, 3&times;2, 2&times;3, 1&times;4)<br/>         Population (6&times;1)<br/>         Rail Transport (2&times;1, 3&times;2, 2&times;3, 1&times;4)<br/>         Trade Route (2&times;3, 3&times;4, 3&times;5, 2&times;6)<br/>    <br/>     24 Technology cards (all different)<br/>     72 Political Action cards<br/>         3 Assassin<br/>         3 Counter Espionage<br/>         4 Coup!<br/>         1 Double Agent<br/>         1 Embargo<br/>         1 Free Elections<br/>         1 Leader Assassinated<br/>         2 Master Spy<br/>         1 Master Spy Ring<br/>         2 Military Aid to Minor Neutral<br/>         3 Military Parade<br/>         3 Naval Building Program (one each: Battleship, Destroyer, Submarine)<br/>         2 Partisans<br/>         5 Political Upheaval<br/>         4 Production Drive (1 artillery, 1 air, 2 tank)<br/>         7 Propaganda<br/>         2 Propaganda Posters<br/>         2 Radio Address<br/>         1 Revolt!<br/>         2 Sabotage<br/>         4 Secret Treaty<br/>         4 Spy<br/>         2 Spy Ring<br/>         4 Support Minor Neutral<br/>         1 Technology Initiative<br/>         4 Threaten to Invade<br/>         3 War Bonds<br/>    <br/>     Stack of Production Point and Oil Reserve Certificates (paper money)<br/><br/><br/>",

Better yet, this Mon Calamari starship is even more powerful when flown under the command of Admiral Ackbar, who can add two red attack dice to any attack made by a starship that fires only from its left and right hull zones during its activation.<br/><br/>Will you race your star cruiser boldly down the middle of the Imperial fleet, firing at enemy ships on both sides? Will you dare your opponent to allow you the use of the Advanced Gunnery objective? Or will you circle the Imperial fleet at a distance, taking shots from a battery armament enhanced by Admiral Ackbar, Slaved Turrets, and the Defiance title?

One player controls one of the 7 Deadly Sins, employing monstrous incarnations of these corruptive forces in an attempt to consume the world and bring about the apocalypse. The rest of the players cooperate as heroes of the F.A.I.T.H. organization who will attempt to fight back the invasion!<br/><br/>The Sins player, on the other hand, has access to the different monsters of each Sin, including Abominations, a Controller, and the terrifying Avatar of Sin! These monsters can attempt to destroy the heroes, or simply hinder their progress on their missions.<br/><br/>Each Sin provides the Sins Player with a different deck of Sins cards that can be played at different times to surprise players with different effects, often tied to the strategy of each Sin. Yes, because each Sin taints the game with an overarching mechanic that is always in effect.<br/><br/>",

His outburst came as a surprise to you, since he was not a man prone to anger, especially when the cause was your awed and frightened line of query about a strange machine he envisioned during the course of his metaphysical research. The doctor took your questions as criticism, and lashed out in response.<br/><br/>You have not spoken to the doctor since that day&hellip;<br/><br/>Inspired by the characters and themes of From Beyond, one of H.P. Lovecraft&rsquo;s most terrifying short stories, The Laboratory challenges players to shut down Crawford Tillinghast&rsquo;s strange machine before the mad genius manages to merge our world with another dimension and all its horrors. Of course, otherworldly terrors feature prominently in The Laboratory, as you&rsquo;ll have to close portals to other realms during your exploration of Tillinghast&rsquo;s mansion home. Can you survive the terrors you&rsquo;ll encounter? Can you find the clues you need to deactivate Tillinghast&rsquo;s arcane device?<br/><br/>Designed by Samuel Bailey and Richard Launius, the creator of Arkham Horror, The Laboratory is a fantastically free-form adventure, chock-full of the themes and mechanics that make Mansions of Madness a uniquely satisfying entry into the world of H.P. Lovecraft&rsquo;s eerie mythos.<br/><br/>",

Everyone knows that a well-placed Butterfly Weed can set you apart from the crowd. Of course, sometimes the most important part of being a trendsetter is knowing when to buck the trend. Should orange blooms become popular, you&rsquo;ll need to know when to quit.<br/><br/>If you&rsquo;re comfortable with the harmonious blend of pinks and purples in the base game of Tussie Mussie, the Orange Flowers expansion is the perfect way to add a pop of color to an old favorite. Orange flowers push the player interaction with their diverse scoring: depending on which you find first, you may want to gather them all for yourself or spread them around the table. There&rsquo;s also the Nasturtium, a potentially powerful (though situational) card that lets the player reorder their arrangement before scoring. Don&rsquo;t let another player find out why its meaning is &ldquo;victory shall be ours&rdquo;!<br/><br/><br/>A good flower arrangement is as much about the framing as it is the flowers. Long-stemmed roses are always in vogue, and the gentle addition of a leafy fern can enhance the beauty of the blooms. Be sparing with your greenery, however: this is still a flower arrangement, after all.<br/><br/>The Greenery expansion introduces 5 cards that work in an all-new way. Greenery cards are great for adding a few extra points to your arrangement...as long as you don&rsquo;t go overboard. One will do just fine; any more than that and you&rsquo;ll lose points. Every face-down offer could be the Greenery that tips the balance, adding a delightful layer to the already rich decision-making of Tussie Mussie.<br/><br/><br/>What good is the gift of flowers without a bow to tie them all together? If you really want to catch the eye of your beloved, don&rsquo;t neglect the ribbon. A proper ribbon accentuates the arrangement rather than merely being an add-on. The extra effort is sure to pay off handsomely.<br/><br/>If you thought Greenery added something new, get ready for Ribbons! This expansion adds 8 Ribbon cards featuring extra goals that players can score in addition to their arrangement. These goals are visible throughout the game and each game will have 1, 2, or 3 of these cards based on player count. Ribbons don&rsquo;t add to or replace cards from the deck, so they can easily be played alongside the other expansions for maximum enjoyment.<br/><br/>",

        "description": "Last Night on Earth: The Zombie Game is a survival horror board game that pits small-town heroes head-to-head against a horde of zombies. A team of four heroes is chosen by one set of players, with each hero having its own special abilities; the zombies are controlled by one or two players. The board is modular, which changes the layout of the town and start positions of each hero. The game comes with several scenarios, which include simple survival, rescue, or escape. Differing combinations of heroes, scenarios, and board configurations offer a lot of replayability.<br/><br/>A hero deck and a zombie deck deliver tactical bonuses to each side. Combat is resolved using six-sided dice, modified by the weapon cards with which heroes may be equipped. Many of the cards include zombie movie tropes to achieve a feel of playing out a horror movie. All the game art is photographic, enhancing the cinematic feel.<br/><br/>Last Night on Earth: The Zombie Game &ndash; 10 Year Anniversary Edition includes a complete and updated version of Last Night on Earth as well as several new additions. The Experience System and Fire Rules, first introduced in the Timber Peak expansion, have been integrated into the original game, as well as new zombie cards, hero cards, a new set of upgrade cards, and a brand new scenario, &quot;Broken Down&quot;. The game includes a new comprehensive rulebook, featuring an updated version of the rules, as well as all of the web scenarios and expansion rulebooks released to date.<br/><br/>This release features plastic miniatures for most counters, including wounds, XP, fire, Old Betsy, spawning pits, gas markers, and even the classic old truck. The CD soundtrack of original thematic music has been remastered and expanded, with new songs being added (the new total is 19 tracks).<br/><br/>All of the classic heroes are included, plus four new playable hero versions of townsfolk from the original game. Everything comes packaged in a numbered collector's box, and everything in Last Night on Earth: The Zombie Game &ndash; 10 Year Anniversary Edition is compatible with all previous expansions for Last Night on Earth.<br/><br/>",

This time, players will have to face off against fearsome warriors from another dimension, known as Wild Hunt Riders, either together or alone.<br/><br/>The Wild Hunt expansion is a significant change for the game's structure - players, instead of moving in turn in their turns, simultaneously move around the board, which takes the planning to a new dimension! Meeting another player does not lead to a fight, but it may result in joint training or exchange of gold, potions, and valuable information about the monsters in the area.<br/><br/>The game is played through several rounds, and at the end of each round, the Wild Hunt summons new monsters or Hounds and moves around the board attacking players.<br/><br/>At the end of the game, players will face the greatest challenge, a duel with one of the greatest Wild Hunt warriors, the mighty Eredin. All players take part in the final clash, trying to overcome the opponent together - Eredin, however, has a set of unique, powerful attacks that make the fight especially difficult.<br/><br/>",

In the DC Comics Deck-building Game Crisis Expansion Pack 3, you will face some of the most epic challenges, events, and destructive forces in the history of comic-dom. In this Crisis Expansion you will find 14 &quot;Impossible Mode&quot; Crime Syndicate Super-Villains to battle against and Crisis versions of EIGHT oversized characters such as Lex Luthor, Sinestro, Bane and many more. But you'll also find six new playable oversized characters and new main deck cards for competitive players.<br/><br/>This Crisis Pack features two unique modes of cooperative play! You can play in a completely cooperative mode, where players all work together to overcome challenges and foes. Or you can play in &quot;Hidden Objective&quot; mode, never before seen in a deck-building game! The Suicide Squad makes its debut as playable oversized characters, and as ne'er-do-wells, working together isn't exactly their strong suit. It seems someone always has their own agenda when this &quot;team&quot; gets together for a mission.

Couple this with the ability to use minion's energy at tainted locations to heal the land and her Walk in the Light ability to ignore a General's combat abilities and you have a very valuable hero to add to your team.<br/><br/>&bull; Druid: The Druid is very powerful in wooded areas (Green Locations) and a strong healer of the tainted land. His &quot;One with the Earth&quot; ability keeps him safe from enemies when in the woods and his ability to summon woodland creatures at any Green Location to attack Minions (even when he is not present) is extremely useful in keeping Orcs and Imps under control.<br/><br/>&bull; Elf Lord: The Elf Lord knows the secret pathways through forests, enabling him to travel swiftly through all green locations. His mastery of Elf Magic enables him to assist himself (or other heroes) with a re-roll of one die each round, and his ability to ambush Minions and Generals in combat makes him a strong warrior in support of the realm.<br/><br/>&bull; Monk: The Monk, a wanderer on some sacred quest for her order, is a master of the Martial Arts, enabling her to land a fury of blows with her staff on the unfortunate minions and Generals she encounters. Additionally, she uses the same training to defend herself against attacks. Her spiritual conditioning and wandering nature provide her with an additional Quest opportunity at all times as she is always holding two Quest Cards.<br/><br/>",

As they seek to win a rare victory for the forces of good and their struggle against the Shadow of Mordor, the heroes must face new perils, including the threat posed by angry bands of militant Dunlendings!<br/><br/>The Dunland Trap features a combat-heavy new scenario in which your heroes must battle their way to freedom against waves of ferocious Dunlendings. Additionally, among its sixty cards, you'll find a new Silvan hero and three copies of each player card, many of which introduce greater shape and surprises to the Silvan trait. Moreover, as it begins &quot;The Ring-maker&quot; cycle, The Dunland Trap also provides more support for the Mount trait, as well as the Time X and Doomed X mechanisms featured in The Voice of Isengard, and players will also discover thematic ties to Saruman and the White Council.<br/><br/>",

There are different elements that will bring more interaction between players in intriguing ways.<br/><br/>The Fox Ghost appears in many Chinese legends. It is a spirit that could shape-shift into different forms, often in a beautiful woman. <br/>Initially it was an evil and disturbing character, but in the novels that were released after several years she got a positive meaning.<br/><br/>In the game, the Fox Ghost will take the shape of any other character available in the game by placing the Fox Ghost Token on top of a character card. Both the active and sight preference abilities of the character she shape-shifted into will be available to her.<br/><br/>The Demon like in other cultures is often represented in the popular Chinese beliefs.<br/><br/>In the game, he will weaken the characters he sees in his line of sight by deducting 3 points from their sight seeing score. The players can defend themselves by using the &quot;shift&quot; lantern (if not used previously) to move a character into another place.<br/><br/>Another way of defending your characters is by placing a cat on the board. Whoever owns a cat will not be affected by the Demon's eyes. By placing a cat, the player will also get one prestige point and the nature element indicated in the card.<br/><br/>Lastly, the Ghost Soldier which is bound to The Great Wall is a figment of my imagination.<br/><br/>The Soldier will grant the possibility to buy a decoration card without placing the decoration on the board. If placed in the garden, the Soldier will grant 3 prestige points without any requirement or 7 if he can see the great wall in the Panoramas in his line of sight.<br/><br/>",

The new rituals create new challenges; to meet these, players need well-conceived cooperation, clever statics, and steady hands.<br/><br/>&mdash;description from the publisher<br/><br/>Make your own set of rules. Choose from pre-set scenarios or mix the rules you like from a variety of new rules.<br/><br/>5 new types of construction plan cards present you with new challenges.<br/><br/>8 new temple floors of tricky shape want to be built into the tower. But each floor has its own rules, which can make the planning of your comrades much more difficult. Deal with temple floors of strange names like &quot;The Double Axe&quot;, &quot;The Wheel of the Five Winds&quot;, &quot;The Wedge Moon&quot;, &quot;The Bridge of Dangers&quot;, &quot;The Ring of Balance&quot;, &quot;The Wheel of Three Truths&quot;, &quot;The Thorn Moon&quot; and &quot;The Crescents of the Sun&quot;.<br/><br/>The tears of the gods, red and blue crystal stones, want to be cleverly built into the tower before the temple is completed.<br/><br/>The cards of fate determine the shapes of the temple floors you can expect in the course of the game. But by no means all future floors will be revealed to you immediately...<br/><br/>13 rituals await you: For each game, you draw a ritual card, which changes the rules of the game and sometimes requires a completely different approach to the usual tasks.<br/>Play the rituals: &quot;THE ENLIGHTENMENT&quot;, &quot;THE DARK&quot;, &quot;THE BAN OF THE BLUE COLUMNS&quot;, &quot;THE CURSE OF THE GODS' TEARS&quot;, &quot;THE GRACE OF THE YELLOW COLUMNS&quot;, &quot;THE JINXED YELLOW COLUMNS&quot;, &quot;THE UNHOLY WHITE COLUMNS&quot;, &quot;THE THIN TIP&quot;, &quot;THE SLIGHT EARTHQUAKE&quot;, &quot;THE GLOWING RED COLUMNS&quot;, &quot;THE BALANCE OF FATE&quot;, &quot;THE NARROW BASE&quot;, and &quot;THE NARROW BASE&quot;.<br/><br/>10 ready-made scenarios let you quickly set up a unique game. Master the scenarios: &quot;Wheels and the Drifting Columns&quot;, &quot;Ruins and Tears&quot;, &quot;Blockades&quot;, &quot;The Blue from the Sky&quot;, &quot;Hard Times&quot;, &quot;High Up&quot;, &quot;In the Heat of Battle&quot;, &quot;Bright as the Day of Light&quot;, &quot;Who has the Choice Has the Agony&quot; and &quot;The Yellow Danger&quot;.<br/><br/>",

By doing so, you'll sink into putrefaction, lose more and more prestige over your opponents, and even part with your precious victory points. This is the price to pay for access to such fearsome abilities and the most frightening of possibilities. Perhaps you will learn to summon the monstrous Apophis, a being of pure evil that dwells in the Underworld. Perhaps you can bend the all-knowing Thoth, the repository of the dark knowledge, to your will.

Over a period of five months, BGG users submitted ideas for two Victorian personalities that featured novel in-game benefits. Eighteen prototypes were developed, a vote was taken, and two promotional cards were selected from among the top vote-getters.<br/><br/>Card #1 (suggested by Luis Mendes): Lady Mary Shelton is a stunning and eligible prestige guest who permits players to add an additional male guest to any activity that she attends.<br/><br/>Card #2 (suggested by James Cartwright): Aston Webb is a renowned architect who permits players to acquire an improvement from the marketplace at no charge.<br/><br/>Note: There were two errata in player aids from the base game. Instead of an online print file correction, the publisher decided to reprint those two players aids (4 copies of each). As the publisher was firing up the card template, they decided to have a little contest where they would 'apologize' for the error by letting backers develop their own cards. These were the two contest winning cards.<br/><br/>-description from designer<br/><br/>",

Just like the commanders in the core set, these new commanders have specific strengths (and weaknesses). For example, Sandor &ldquo;the Hound&rdquo; Clegane uses the new fearsome keyword, refusing to let his enemies disengage and forcing them to retreat two hexes for each morale result rolled in combat.<br/><br/>In addition to commanders, Wardens of the West also introduces three all-new unit types of Lannister affiliation. The House Brax pikemen specialize in formations, while the Clegane crossbowmen utilize the new aimed shot keyword. The Westerlands militia are easy to break and lack formal military training, but they make up for it in their vast numbers.<br/><br/>Wardens of the West adds more than 30 new plastic miniatures and over 30 new cards. It also includes a Rules and Battle Plans book as well as more terrain overlays, banners, and tokens.

        "description": "Hailing from a far away city, the Manhunter is a sadistic killer. It brutally executes survivors, cowing settlements into willingly submitting people to it. No one knows why it abducts survivors, or what they're used for, only that once taken, they are never seen again. Settlements will have to choose: take up arms against their fellow man, or accept the blood tax.<br/><br/>The Manhunter is a brutal foe, preferring to break enemies' bodies before ending their lives. If it can be defeated, the scarred survivors will benefit from the monster's invaluable hunting tools. If not, the settlement can submit to its will and trade their kin for resources.<br/><br/>",

        "description": "Nemesis: Aftermath &amp; Void Seeders &amp; Medic is an expansion for Nemesis. It contains all of the stretch goals from the Kickstarter campaign: the Aftermath expansion, the Void Seeders expansion, and the Medic.<br/>&mdash;user summary<br/><br/>&quot;Every spaceship has a voice; a melody of machinery and subsystems its crew learns intimately during long travels. The problem is, ever since the last mission our ship sounds WRONG. There&rsquo;s something foul in the way it&rsquo;s speaking to us. Barely audible murmurs. Strange whispers no machine could make. The dark corridors and vast halls almost seem to SING.<br/><br/>Some of us have tried to locate sources of this interferences, but they always seemed two steps ahead. Stalked by their never-ending presence, we soon started cracking. Our engineer has cut some words on his flesh. When we asked why, he replied:&lsquo;Incandescent secrets need to be written in blood&rsquo;. Then, our navigator took a spacewalk without her suit. When we pulled her in, her entire face frozen and cracked, she grinned in a way I will never forget.<br/><br/>Now, it got even worse. Noises turned into voices, sharing tales of slaughter and terror. They do not run from us anymore. They encircle us and herd us through the ship to some dark purpose. I need to UNDERSTAND them before it&rsquo;s too late. I put my hand on the pistol grip, looking at the backs of my last two crewmembers. I see dark mysteries swirling under their skulls. It would only take two bullet holes to release them...&quot;<br/><br/>Rules:<br/><br/>Overlook:<br/><br/>Voidseeders are a race that can interact with the minds of crew members. They will have few nests instead of one, but only one strong fighting presence at given moment. Once killed, new one will be awakened from the most developed nest.<br/><br/>This race will focus on whispering and controlling minds - people who will be near them will start to hear voices commanding them to do different destructive things.<br/><br/>Nests:<br/><br/>On the board, there is normally 1 Nest as a room token, but there are additionally 2-3 smaller nests. Those are places where new Voidseeders will born. At the moment of discovering main Nest, you should put a Stalker miniature in it (this is the model that is on the ship from the beginning. He is very dangerous, especially when faced by people with a high Insanity level).<br/><br/>Other Nests will start showing up on the board together with discovering certain Exploration tokens. Those nests will be especially dangerous. They will not move, but if a crew member will happen to end the turn at the tile with a nest, he will get a serious wound.<br/><br/>Voidlurkers<br/><br/>They will spawn in nests, and their objective will be to spread insanity and try to move players to Nests.<br/><br/>Whispersers<br/><br/>They will work very similar to Voidlurkers, but with the difference that they will have the main goal of defending the main nest.<br/><br/>Stalker<br/><br/>He is a main guardian. He takes advantage from fear / insanity of the crew members and will focus on them.<br/><br/>Despoiler<br/><br/>Equivalent of the Queen. Actually, it is hard to say if she is real or if it is a mass hallucination. One way or the other, she will only emerge when all Insanity tokens are on players (number of tokens will be specific for different numbers of players). She is extremely strong.<br/><br/>Contamination card<br/><br/>Here it will change a little bit - players will normally get a contamination card every time they will get an insanity token. They will be easier to discard (you don't need to check if it was infected or not). Effect of the card will only take place at the very end of the game, and it will be the same as in the normal version - if it will turn out it was indeed &quot;infected,&quot; it will mean that your character, even if escaped, went mad and lost the game either way.<br/><br/>Whispers mechanic<br/><br/>This mechanism will change the noise mechanic. Whenever you move (or an event card will tell you to), you will need to roll for whispers. If you would get a corridor with an whisper token already in it (you hear something more) - you need to draw a Card from the Insanity deck. Those cards will apply to you or not based on the numbers of insanity tokens your character has. Effects might be very different - from one-time action to permanent disabilities.<br/><br/>Combat<br/><br/>In combat, Voidlurkers will only try to add insanity tokens to you and then run away to the closes nest. Whisperers will be harder to kill, as well as present some portion of actual physical danger, but their main weapon will still be giving you insanity tokens.<br/><br/>Things will change with Stalker and Despoiler - those two will be huge opponents who will give you real wounds, so you will not want to be near them.<br/><br/>Event phase<br/><br/>In the event phase, one additional step that will be added is checking your insanity tokens and numbers of Voidlurkers and Whisperers in all rooms next to yours. If the number of them is higher than the number of insanity tokens, you add one insanity token and draw one contamination card.<br/><br/>But whenever you will be in a room with other people, this effect will be less harmful. (they can help you calm down)<br/><br/>Overall feel<br/><br/>Overall feel we will be going for will be way different from what you will have in the base Core Box. We have a lot of cool ideas how to get Insanity cards in a way, that it will be an additional layer of you not trusting your friends  - not only because of their objective but perhaps because of the Insanity cards.<br/><br/>Additionally, interaction with Voidseeders will be way different, you will need to think very carefully where to move or place your hero to not go insane.<br/><br/>&mdash;description from the publisher<br/><br/>",

The Rebels and other light side forces have established a new base on the barren ice world where the extreme cold offers protection from detection, even as it poses a constant danger. Hoth's cold can easily exhaust or kill anyone caught exposed, and its driving winds and snow can jam sensors and blind characters, leaving them vulnerable to the planet's fierce, native predators.<br/><br/>Still, in The Desolation of Hoth, the cold strikes in both directions. The Rebel Alliance and their allies have spent time adapting their equipment to Hoth's harsh environment, and these preparations pay off in times of need. While the light side controls more of the planet than its foes, their new Hoth objectives grant them protection from dark side assaults, advantages in edge battles, and other benefits.<br/><br/>Of course, there's a lot more to this first Force Pack than ice and snow! Inspired by the early scenes from The Empire Strikes Back, The Desolation of Hoth brings you new creatures, droids, snowspeeders, and iconic characters like Wedge Antilles and Darth Vader. The frozen wastelands of Hoth are normally as desolate as they are vast, but as they set the stage for the future battles of Star Wars: The Card Game, they fill with action and life!<br/><br/>Contains objective sets 37-42.<br/><br/>",

Waging war on each other for generations, the battle-scarred Nations of Trederra use Dark Stone to fuel their engines of death, polluting their planet with radiation and drifting clouds of toxic gas. But there are also treasures to be found amidst the devastation, weapons and technology advanced beyond reckoning by brutal centuries of warfare.<br/><br/>The Trederra Deluxe Expansion introduces a brand new OtherWorld for the Heroes to explore!  This includes a full set of 18 new Map Tiles depicting the war-torn planet of Trederra, with dangerous new Radioactive Spaces and Cover Terrain! These Map Tiles also have an all new set of unique Mine rooms on the reverse, bringing more variety and new Encounters to discover throughout the Mines.  All of the cards needed for this alien world are included, such as Trederran Encounters, Artifacts, Map Cards, OtherWorld Threats, and more, as well as a host of new cards for adventuring in the Mines!  6 New Missions will challenge your Heroes as well.<br/><br/>This Deluxe OtherWorld Expansion includes a host of dangerous new Enemies to encounter, including: 6 Trederran Legionnaires - Alien soldiers committed to the cause of &lsquo;winning the war&rsquo; for their Nation and armed with deadly Dark Stone weaponry to get the job done. 3 large Z-4 Grenadiers - Heavily armored demolition soldiers immune to all but the strongest attacks and armed with terrifying thermal charges. 6 Trederran Mutants - Soldiers who have succumbed to the corrupting radiation of the Dark Stone and are now little more than viciously mindless savages. And 3 Trederran Lieutenants - Ruthless officers that command their legions with an iron fist.  Also included are 6 pieces of plastic Cover Terrain (3x Barrels and 3x Tank Traps). These are for use with the Cover Terrain rules and are placed on the board to give a more 3D feel to the Environment.<br/><br/>Like all OtherWorlds, Trederra has a set of unique Encounters, Artifacts, Map Cards, and OtherWorld Threat cards, as well as a couple of Global Rules that make adventuring there more distinct. The Global Rules are listed on the World Card included in this expansion.  While exploring Trederra, Heroes will find themselves navigating an extremely hostile environment full of Land Mines, poisonous Toxic Clouds, Acid Rain, and relentless patrols of Enemies, always on the hunt for intruders. There are many treasures to be found though, amongst the ruins and devastation, especially in the form of powerful alien weapons and protective clothing and gear.<br/><br/>",

Because of its control of inter-planetary commerce, CHOAM was the largest single source of wealth in the Imperium. Influence in CHOAM was a major focus of political maneuvering in the Imperium, both to maximize dividends and also to skim profits.  The leaders and bureaucrats of CHOAM were dedicated to controlling vital products that enriched the Great Houses . . . and CHOAM itself.<br/><br/>House Richese, just like the Ixians, had a well-earned reputation for ingenuity, and created important technological inventions.  But Count Ilban Richese suffered a number of business blunders that threatened to bankrupt their fortunes.  After being ousted from governing Arrakis, they were reduced to selling off important creations simply to raise enough funds to continue their efforts to compete.<br/><br/>This expansion also introduces Leader Skills, which let you assign a skill like Mentat, Swordmaster of Ginaz, or Prana Bindu Adept to one of your leader discs.  It also included Advanced Stronghold Cards, which give you a &quot;homefield advantage&quot; when battling in a stronghold you control.<br/><br/>&mdash;description from the publisher<br/><br/>",

The Emissaries can be added to other decks as-sold to include these new cards to the mix.  Inquisitors change the deck building limitations for players interested in constructing decks.<br/><br/>",

Having suspected Sauron's evil purposes, Celembrimbor gave them to three Elf-lords who hid them through the ages and used them to resist the Dark Lord&rsquo;s influence.<br/><br/>Should he recover the One, Sauron will command all the Rings of Power, even the Three, and he will be able to undo all the good that the Elves had created with the Three. Fortunately, though, Sauron does not have the One, and he does not yet have the means to undo the works created from the Three.<br/><br/>In Celebrimbor's Secret, the fifth Adventure Pack in &quot;The Ring-maker&quot; cycle for The Lord of the Rings: The Card Game, you will at last lead several of Middle-earth's heroes toward the end of the quest that was given to them by Saruman the White. Amid the ruins of Ost-in-Edhil lies the forge where Celebrimbor crafted the Three. For ages, its location and all within it were kept secret, but as the power of Mordor grows, Saruman desperately seeks any means to fight against the Shadow, including whatever secrets the heroes may discover in Celebrimbor&rsquo;s forge.<br/><br/>Celebrimbor's Secret, which includes sixty new cards (three copies each of twenty cards), also introduces a powerful new hero &ndash; Galadriel, the Lady of Lothlórien &ndash; and player cards for each sphere that enhance the Silvan and Noble traits, as well as the Doomed X mechanism.<br/><br/>",

There is no capital city to start from. Land colonists are built only later in the game, but can switch their position between the islands.<br/><br/>As an extra, Concordia: Balearica comes with a fishmarket. The fishmarket may be combined not only with the new BALEARICA map, but also used as a variant together with the base game or any other CONCORDIA map.<br/><br/>As a new commodity, fish replaces the ordinary bonus units you usually collect when playing your Prefect. The bonus is doubled up to 2 fish in provinces which have failed to produce in the last round. Sell your fish on a separate fishmarket, where you can get either goods, cash, or special actions in return. This way the fishmarket offers an extra layer of planning ahead, and new challenges for the experienced CONCORDIA player.<br/><br/>The opposite side of this board has the ITALIA map for all who have missed it when buying Concordia Venus.<br/><br/>-description from publisher<br/><br/>",

With Seer Kel, you can always find the spaces between bodies to ensure your attacks strike home. Even as you use your unnatural sight to look past those who would stand in your way, you may gaze into the future and see what plans the overlord player has in store for the heroes. As your heroic feat with Seer Kel, you can look at the top five cards of the Overlord deck, giving you unparalleled insight into the traps and punishment that will shortly arrive! What&rsquo;s more, you can choose one of these cards and place it on the bottom of the Overlord deck before you shuffle the remaining cards and replace them on top of the deck. In this way, you can mitigate the most dangerous possible threat before it ever becomes reality. Ultimately, you&rsquo;ll need magical tricks like this to achieve victory in Stewards of the Secret, especially as the overlord player calls upon horrific monsters spawned by ancient sorcery.<br/><br/>The ferrox can sap the power of their enemies and use it to repair their own bodies. Sustained by their victim&rsquo;s strength, a ferrox is a worthy match for any hero. When you call upon the ferrox as the overlord player, you&rsquo;ll quickly see the attributes that made them such useful servants for Devis. A ferrox can hit dangerously hard in melee combat, and it can spend its surges to pierce even the thickest plate armor and spread disease to hinder the heroes turn after turn. The master ferrox boasts an even more dangerous ability. By spending an action, a master ferrox can use Extract to choose an adjacent hero. That hero must test its might&mdash;if he fails, he suffers two fatigue, and the ferrox recovers two damage! Not only does Extract give your ferrox unexpected staying power, dealing fatigue can restrict the heroes&rsquo; movement and their use of Class cards. If you wish to recover the dangerous secrets of the mad mage Devis, you can do no better than to call upon the ferrox for your own dark army.<br/><br/>",

Tyriel, a new hero for the High Elves, forces an opponent to reconsider his attack if he has limited units to send.<br/><br/>Destruction&rsquo;s mighty followers gain the might of Malus Darkblade, of the Dark Elves. A master of the blade, this Dark Elf Hero will lay waste to any unit too cowardly to face him on the fields of battle. Tzeentch exerts his influence by granting Chaos the use of Bolt of Change! This spell turns a development into a unit, giving Chaos some extra firepower, or setting up a foe to have his development killed on the fields of battle.<br/><br/>In addition the forces of Destruction gain the duplicitous help of the Skaven. This first pack features the services of Greyseer Thanquol, Clan Rats, and the awe-inspiring majesty of the Warp Lightning Cannon!<br/><br/>The forces of Order see their ranks swell with the presence of Witch Hunters. The first to appear is Marius the Righteous. This heroic character is able to deal a devastating blow to any corrupted unit.<br/><br/>The Skavenblight Threat is the first pack in the Corruption Cycle, a set of six linked packs highlighting the forces of the Skaven, Witch Hunters, and the seductive arts of magic.<br/><br/>Expands :<br/><br/>    Warhammer : Invasion<br/><br/><br/>",

Each player controls a Viking clan, looking to achieve victory by reaping glory in various ways or controlling the most prized territories of this new continent.<br/><br/>The game focus is on streamlined rules and mechanisms, allowing for a fast-paced and smooth rhythm of play. Each turn, players alternate their actions to adapt their strategies to their opponents' moves and the expansion of the board. Fame (i.e., points) can be earned by exploring, fighting, and controlling and developing territories. The various corresponding actions are played through the cards that the players have in hand. At the end of each turn, they have to choose a new card to improve their personal deck as their clans develop new tactics and technologies.<br/><br/>The conquest of Northgard also requires clever management of resources to build new buildings, improve your warriors' effectiveness, better your hand of cards, and upgrade your clan's specificities. The winter phase makes this management more difficult as you have to feed your units to keep them healthy and happy.<br/><br/>The pace of the game is set by the players as the game ends after seven turns, but can also be cut short at any time if one of them is in control of three closed territories hosting certain types of buildings.<br/><br/>'--description from the publisher's website<br/><br/>",

The game also features wooden chocolate pieces and a movable conveyer belt making the physicality blended with euro mechanics a unique experience.<br/><br/>Gameplay overview:<br/>Players are each given a starting player board which will have two Factory parts which apply to a physical conveyer belt. The conveyer belt part of the player board contains long slot with an empty region in which to push square tiles along. The tiles will house the chocolate pieces players will manipulate throughout the game.<br/><br/>During the game players will initially draft new factory parts (to add to their player board) and specialists (one time use cards with special powers).<br/><br/>Then each player will &ldquo;push&rdquo; three times cocoa into their machines. During each &ldquo;push&rdquo; players will be able to use fuel and their factory parts to manipulate their Chocolate pieces. Careful consideration will be required for the spatial element of the game as Chocolate pieces can only be manipulated during a push by the Factory part that is adjacent to their tile.<br/><br/>Players score points by creating chocolates for public and personal objectives.

Taze knows what it takes to be a Champion. As one of the few Tauriak born into the warrior caste of his people, Taze was groomed to become a warrior. As battles between clans were decided by a trial of champions, Taze was tutored by the best trainers and armed with the greatest weapons, becoming a living weapon that would bring victory to his clan again and again. Adored by his friends, and feared by his enemies, Taze built his life on triumph after bloody triumph. His was an existence of strength and battle, and Taze would have it no other way.<br/><br/>Through the countless wars that have engulfed history, Fabulosa itself has suffered the most. A world ravaged and torn, eventually nature had to fight back. A dryad of incredible power, Loralei was once the nesting spirit of a druidic grove, her life given to protect that sacred place. With its destruction, she was free to venture into Fabulosa, protecting other groves from the same fate. Appearing wherever she was needed, Loralei kept the world in balance, ensuring that no matter what atrocities the races of Fabulosa committed, life would find a way to survive.<br/><br/>Nevamor&rsquo;s former life as a druid was cut short by the Droskarian Horde, but whilst death comes for all things, not all things accept death as easily as others. Nevamor&rsquo;s will to live extended far beyond the mortal coil, and he returned a wraith; the first undead. Although his first act was one of revenge, soon Nevamor became a protector of the lost, an avenging shade that preyed upon those who would prey on others. With his trusted companion Poe, Nevamor would hunt those who would think themselves the hunter and prove them wrong.<br/><br/>&mdash;description from the publisher<br/><br/>",

The sword she wields is extremely deadly because of her ability to foresee the battle beforehand, enabling her use all Special Cards as Battle Luck cards. If her attacks fail to defeat all enemy in the area, she can call upon her magic to summon images that will confuse her attackers and send them them wandering off to other lands.<br/><br/>&bull; Thief: The Thief is the master of sneaking behind enemy lines to not only scout the army of the Dark Lord, but also to steal battle plans from the General's headquarters tent. While not the greatest of warriors, the use of her daggers in combat, especially when treasure can be stolen, often enables her to question the enemy before dispatching them and to gain valuable information in the form of Hero Cards.<br/><br/>",

There, they hope to locate the Dwarf named Nalir, who holds information that the White Wizard believes may prove valuable in the fight against the Dark Lord of Mordor. Finding the Dwarf proves to be a matter of very little difficult, but gaining the information he can provide proves to be a greater challenge...<br/><br/>In Trouble in Tharbad, the third Adventure Pack in &quot;The Ring-maker&quot; cycle for The Lord of the Rings: The Card Game, your heroes must help Nalir extricate himself from the unfortunate predicament into which he has placed himself. You must battle Orcs, slip through abandoned streets, and seek to elude the spies from Mordor who have also taken an interest in the Dwarf and his information. Throughout the scenario's course of events, you must remain vigilant in order to keep Nalir alive. Should he perish, so will your chances of returning his information to Saruman, and the White Wizard's efforts to counter the threat of Mordor will be diminished.<br/><br/>Along with its new scenario, Trouble in Tharbad introduces a new Silvan hero, along with three copies of each new player card. You'll find more support for the Silvan and Gondor traits, the Doomed X keyword, decks that keep their threat levels at twenty or below, and more!<br/><br/>",

A band of rebels who fought against the Empire in the Lothal Sector tucked away in the outer rim. Thanks to the help of the elite Spectres, they have achieved great success.<br/><br/>Force users are rare in the time of the Rebellion, many have been twisted by Emperor Palpatine for his own nefarious purposes. The exception to this is the former Jedi Kanan Jarrus and his young Padawan Ezra Bridger.

Recruiting them to your side will take work, but maybe a common enemy will bring your heroes and these Force users together.<br/><br/>This Ally Pack contains everything you need to add these heroes to your Imperial Assault campaign and skirmish games!

Thanks to a volcano that takes up seven of the board's hexes and now towers high above the game board, lava comes into play. During set-up, each player places a triangular tile of three hexes near the island's perimeter, with one of these hexes being covered with lava; the player's ATV starts on another of these hexes.<br/><br/>During the game, you can violate the normal rules of card playing by laying down an illegal card, e.g., &quot;not in the mountains&quot; when an &quot;in the mountains&quot; card was played earlier for this treasure, after which you immediately cover this card with one of the four new volcanic clue cards included in this expansion: next to/not next to the volcano and next to/not next to lava. Once this treasure is claimed, the volcanic card is returned to the side of the playing area for subsequent use.<br/><br/>Whenever a player collects an amulet, they add another hex of lava to the game board, whether adjacent to the volcano or lava already in play. This means that the island will transform dynamically throughout the game, possibly moving treasures to locations where no one suspected them previously. After all, the largest forest might not stay the largest if overrun by lava, and the forests themselves might even disappear completely!<br/><br/>During a turn, an ATV can travel over lava &mdash; but not stop in lava &mdash; if the player spends an amulet or (if they have no amulets) discards their largest treasure card. Don't let your travel routes get cut off by the lava flow...<br/><br/>",

Go back to the first days of Xavier&rsquo;s School for Gifted Youngsters and play with the original incarnation of these iconic Heroes and Villains. These characters not only have game pieces that reflect their classic looks, but also their game mechanics reflect a less experienced and more &ldquo;raw&rdquo; version of them.

        "description": "Collectors box set that includes all of the Kickstarter stretch goals that were included in the King pledge for the original Conan Kickstarter campaign.<br/><br/>Conan, designed by Fred Henry and based on the Conan universe by Robert E. Howard, is a scenario-based semi-cooperative asymmetric miniatures board game. One player is the Opponent, playing the Opposition forces, and the other players (1 to 4) play Conan and his companions: Shevatas the thief, Hadrathus the Priest/Sorcerer, Belit the pirate queen, Valeria the warrior, etc. The game is based purely on Robert E. Howard's novels and short stories (and not the movies or other non-Howardian material). The publisher has hired Patrice Louinet, a Howard expert, to make sure the art and the scenarios are compatible with Howard's vision.<br/><br/>Each game is a scenario, played on a map. There will be several maps &mdash; Pictish Village, Underground temple, Tavern, Pirate ship, etc. &mdash; and each map can have several scenarios set on it. The game is fast, one hour approximately. It's possible to play several scenarios in a campaign, but you can also play each scenario individually. There will be a dozen playable scenarios in the base box.<br/><br/>At the beginning of a scenario, players choose their team (Conan and two or three other heroes). The Opponent gathers all the miniatures (picts, Necromancer, skeleton warriors, monsters, etc.), tokens, cards from the chosen scenario. The game usually plays in a limited number of turns (ten, for instance). Each scenario can have very different objectives: find the princess captured by picts and hidden in a hut and leave the camp before the pict hunters return; find the magical key to open a sealed door, steal the jewel and leave; kill the Necromancer by the end of turn 10; survive by the end of turn 10; escape the prison; etc.<br/><br/>During their turn, the heroes can activate or rest. If they activate, they can spend &quot;gems&quot; from their energy pool to do all sorts of actions: move, fight (melee or distance), defend, pick a lock, reroll, etc. If they rest, they can move a lot of gems from their &quot;spent&quot; pool box to their &quot;available&quot; pool box. When they take an action, they throw a number of dice equal to the number of gems they put in their action. There are three different kinds of dice: yellow (the weaker dice), orange (medium) and red (strong). Each character has a color based on their specialty: Conan throws red dice in combat while the Sorcerer throws yellow dice in combat; the thief throws red dice in Manipulation actions, while Conan throws orange dice; etc. Each player can have equipment cards (armor, magic potions, weapons, etc.) which give them bonuses on their dice rolls.<br/><br/>The Opponent plays differently. He uses a board with eight slidable tiles, plus his own Energy gems. Each tile corresponds to one unit (1 to 3 miniatures) on the game mat, and all of the miniature abilities are written on this tile (movement, armor, attack, special abilities). The tile position on the board corresponds to the numbers 1-8. The Opponent has a pool of energy gems and each time he activates one unit, he needs to spend a number of gems matching the tile placement: tile#1 costs 1 energy gem, tile#2 costs 2 gems, etc. Whatever tile the Opponent chooses to activate, he spends the corresponding energy cost (moving his energy gems from the available pool to the spent pool), then takes the tile out and moves it to the end of the sliding track: If he wants to activate this unit again, it will cost him 8 gems, because the unit is now on position 8. The Opponent can activate a maximum of two tiles, and he regains only a certain number of gems each turn (depending on the scenario).<br/><br/>In a typical scenario, the heroes need to accomplish something and the Opponent wins if the heroes fail to reach their objective &mdash; but in some scenarios, the Opponent has his own objectives and the Heroes win if they prevent him from accomplishing his goal.<br/><br/>Components (according to the back of the box):<br/><br/>     33 spell cards (actually 41 in French, 41 in English)<br/>     33 equipment cards (actually 29, 5 blanks, and 5 labeled A through E ---two sets of 39, in English and French)<br/>     61 tiles (actually 90, see below)<br/>     39 tokens<br/>     17 Hero sheets<br/>     1 scenario booklet (1 in French, 1 in English; 4 scenarios)<br/>     1 map board<br/>     6 dice<br/>     1 dice bag<br/>     1 map of Conan's world (single-sided, English only)<br/>     115 miniatures (plastic)<br/><br/><br/>The tiles need to be looked at more closely. 29 come in English-French pairs, 16 are unique (meant to be used in either language: the Event tile, the two Pirates, and 13 Heroes), and 8 are non-lingual pairs (e.g. Conan, Thaug, Constantius, Slasher, etc.). A single-language set thus consists of 29+16+8 = 53 tiles, the remaining 37 being set aside.<br/><br/>",

To use the deck, create space for these card stacks near the game board: Event Deck, Future Event, Current Event and a Discard Pile. The Event Deck includes more cards than players will use during a single game, so no two games will play out the same way.<br/><br/>Instead of drawing randomly from the deck, players can build their own custom decks, from a vicious deck packed with negative events to a bountiful deck filled with positive events. The deck can be tweaked for each of the expansion maps, and four blank cards are included for players who want to create their own events.<br/><br/>",

Clair. Edge of Darkness combines Card Crafting, Worker Placement, shared deck-building, and a whole new Threat Challenge system in a medium-weight euro-style board game of 60 to 120 minutes for 1 to 4 players.<br/><br/>Players are the heads of powerful guilds in the City. Each Guild vies with the others to become the leaders of the City in a desperate struggle against great evil. But the Guilds must also work together because the dangers facing the city can harm them all.<br/><br/>The Guilds exert their control in the city by sending agents to various locations where they can generate resources or abilities and enable the Guild to take actions. Guilds grow in power as they maneuver their agents and loyalists into positions of importance in the districts and organizations of the City. Over time the Guilds can seek to create synergies between the places their agents have been assigned and the tendrils of influence the Guilds have connected to the City's infrastructure.<br/><br/>To win a Guild must have the most power in the city when the game ends. Power is gained having the allegiance of important citizens and nobles, by accumulating wealth, and by undertaking actions beneficial to the City such as defending it from external and internal threats.<br/><br/>Here are some highlights of the mechanics in the game:<br/><br/><br/>     Card Crafting: Similar to the original card-crafting game, Mystic Vale, all cards are constructed of crafting slips which have game content on 1/3rd of the slip and are transparent on the other 2/3rds. During the game players will construct cards, combining (sleeving) different effects onto one card (ideally in ways that make strategic sense). However, unlike Mystic Vale, the transparent cards are double-sided, and when you upgrade the &quot;good&quot; side of the cards (front), you also add strength to the &quot;bad&quot; side of the cards (back).<br/>     Group deckbuilding using one shared deck: Rather than having your own deck, there is a central deck that all players draw from and discard to. Different players will have the allegiance of different cards in that deck. Using other players' cards means you have to pay them. During the game you can claim allegiance of more cards in the deck by sleeving a slip into the card with your color and seal.<br/>     Card-driven worker placement: While your actions are card-driven, most costs in the game are in the form of opportunity cost. Advancements don't have a cost, instead they require the use of workers to a greater or lesser degree depending on the power of the card. e.g. many effects require placing or pulling workers from different city locations as dictated by the card effects. Since you have a limited number of workers to use, you will constantly be choosing to forgo one useful thing in order to do another.<br/>     Threat Tower:  There is a Threat Tower which dictates when and whom Threats will attack. Cards leave the shared deck and enter the Threat Board, where they accumulate Threat Cubes on each player's turn. These cubes are color-coded, and when a threshold number of cubes on a card, it attacks the City. If one player has the majority of cubes on the card, it attacks that player. If the majority color is black, it attacks all players!<br/>     Modular set up: Edge of Darkness will come with 12 Locations. Each game you use only 10 of these Locations, which can be specifically selected or chosen randomly, making for a lot of variety from game-to-game in the types of challenges you will face and the strategies you will need to employ. These Locations are comprised of a Location Board and Crafting Slips. Location Boards may specify special rules for worker placement, or extend the basic rules with all new systems. For example, a combination of Location Boards can be used to assemble a party of heroes to take the fight to the Threat Tower and engage in a Monster Hunt!<br/><br/><br/>",

You don't have to participate, but if you don't &mdash; and the building never comes to be &mdash; you'll suffer a penalty.<br/><br/>In more detail, this expansion contains fifteen edifice cards: five each in ages I, II, and III. To set up, choose one card from each age at random, then place it project side face up on the table and place 2-5 participation markers on each card, depending on the number of players. The project side lists both the potential reward and potential penalty.<br/><br/>Once during an age, when you construct a level of your wonder, you can pay the cost of the edifice card for the current age (in addition to the cost of that level) and gain a participation marker from that card.<br/><br/>As soon as the last participation marker is removed from a card, flip the card over to reveal its constructed side and immediately give each player the listed reward. If at the end of the age at least one participation marker remains on the card, each player without one of these markers suffers the penalty. (If a player cannot suffer the full penalty, e.g., paying 5 coins, they instead take a debt token worth -2, -3, or -5 points depending on the age.)<br/><br/>7 Wonders: Edifice contains two new double-sided wonders; one of them, Ur, can only be used with this expansion, while Carthage can be used in any game of 7 Wonders.<br/><br/>7 Wonders: Edifice can be used with any edition of 7 Wonders.<br/><br/>",

No one from the University has claimed responsibility for this giant, mutant rabbit (although Bob is the prime suspect), but he does seem to be at least tame, so long as he's fed regularly.  When unleashed, Nibbles exhibits the disturbingly trollish tendency to devour his enemies whole and regenerate any battle wounds in seconds.  Fortunately, the new effort to re-take Arcadia has come at just the right time.  It wouldn't do to let Nibbles run out of food.<br/><br/>",

From then on, only YOU can summon that Monster type.<br/><br/>Monsters included in the box are:<br/>- Dimensional Shamblers<br/>- Star Vampire<br/>- Elder Thing<br/>- Servitor of the Outer Gods<br/><br/>Azathoth is a Great Old One  unusual in many ways. When he is summoned, you choose how much Power you want to spend, and place a special marker on your Power track. This is Azathoth's combat ability - so the more you spend, the more deadly he is. Of course, in some games, a person, fearing Azathoth's misuse, might summon it cheap and dirty just to keep it out of the hands of another player. That's all part of the fun.<br/><br/>",

Others regard them as a menace, a band of criminals that must be stopped at all costs!<br/><br/>Never shying away from danger, a bold adventuring party has joined the fray. This band of hardened wanderers in Wildlands: The Adventuring Party can replace one of the existing factions, with their unique healing ability keeping them in the fight even when hope seems lost, or they can take to the battlefield using the &quot;Encounter&quot; rules to steal crystal shards and attack anyone who gets in their way.<br/><br/>In more detail, when using the adventuring party as a faction, the player controlling them does not assign map cards to their individual characters. Instead, they choose five cards to pass to the player on their right and keep the other five face down. When revealing a character, the player can choose any location they have a map card for, discarding that card. They also bring a new action to the game: heal. Exclusively available to Thom the Cleric, this action allows the player to remove one damage token from a character in the same or an adjacent space.<br/><br/>When used as an encounter, the adventuring party is set up on the board at the start of the game, then at the end of each player's turn the top card of the adventuring party deck is revealed, with the character whose artwork is displayed taking an action. Which action is taken depends on the character and the relative board state. As the game progresses, the troublesome band makes their way around the board, attacking your characters, stealing your loot, and generally causing chaos.<br/><br/>",

At that time, the railroad industry was driven by an abundant source of coal from the coal mines of Western Pennsylvania. Unique features to this map include coal-producing towns and cities in Western Pennsylvania, heavily-urbanized cities in Southeastern Pennsylvania, and special bonuses for coal (black cube) deliveries: coal can be delivered twice as far as your locomotive, or you can receive double income for its delivery!<br/><br/>Northern California: This Age of Steam expansion takes place in Northern California, focusing on San Francisco, Oakland, San Jose, Santa Cruz and Sacramento, and the struggle to move goods across the San Francisco Bay Area. Unique features to this map include two bridges across the San Francisco Bay, the port city of Santa Cruz where goods line up for delivery, a three tile San Jose city with double goods growth, and the ever-changing destination of Sacramento, where the goods desired by that city are dictated by the flow of goods into Santa Cruz. This map is a redesign of the popular Age of Steam: Bay Area map (Essen 2005 Limited Edition), with modified cities and towns, with a map changed slightly in size to fit on a standard Age of Steam board. It is slightly more forgiving than the original map.<br/><br/>From Ted Alspach, the designer of Age of Steam Expansion: Bay Area (Limited 2005 Essen Edition).<br/><br/>",

        "description": "Power Grid: Middle East/South Africa is a pair of expansion maps for Power Grid!<br/><br/>&bull; For decades, there has been an abundance of oil in the Middle East. However, in the near future the so-called &quot;peak oil&quot; threatens this area: This is the point in time when the output of the oil wells begins to decrease. Already, a few countries of this region have nuclear power plants, and that number will increase in the future as the amount of oil from the wells diminishes. Most likely, other energy sources will play a part, too, such as the recycling of plastic waste.<br/><br/>The players start the game with an excessive supply of oil. Additionally, the players have access to plenty of natural gas (using the coal tokens of the base game) and a few solar plants (the green power plants). However, at the start of the game the players cannot buy nuclear or garbage power plants.<br/><br/>During Step 2, the abundance of oil and natural gas will run dry. Both nuclear and garbage power plants will then be available as alternatives. Thus, in the middle of the game the players are forced to adjust their power plant mix.<br/><br/>&bull; The energy supply in South Africa is executed almost exclusively by a single trust, which is the seventh biggest energy supplier in the world measured against the production of energy. Roughly 90% of the energy is produced in coal power plants. Additionally, South Africa uses a few nuclear power plants and both water and wind ecological power plants.<br/><br/>Because of its size, the trust also supplies half of the rest of Africa with energy. Thus, the game board contains six international power connections and a lot of available coal.<br/><br/>",

        "description": "Skarn's origins lie shrouded in mystery. Some believe that he has always guarded the manor house, even before the death of the High Mage that lived there. Others suggest that he was unintentionally created from residual magic released by the wizard's death. Still others would say that the ravens created a new guardian after the passing of their old master. Whether Skarn is a raging monster hungry for power or a misunderstood soul devoted to a lonely cause, all agree that Skarn's potential stretches far beyond what can be allowed.<br/><br/>Descent: Journeys in the Dark (Second Edition) &ndash; Skarn Lieutenant Pack includes a detailed, sculpted plastic figure of Skarn to replace the lieutenant token included in the Manor of Ravens expansion as well as a ten-card Plot deck that lets you spread Skarn's regenerative abilities to the monsters under your command.<br/><br/>This Plot deck also gives you the opportunity to unleash Skarn on Terrinoth by summoning him into battle as your agent in any quest that does not include him as a lieutenant. In battle, heroes will find Skarn a powerful opponent, resilient to damage and able to mend his own wounds in the heat of combat. What's more, Skarn's attacks frequently damage more than one hero, possibly threatening an entire hero party at once if they move in too close.<br/><br/>",

The word is constructed from Greek (&pi;έ&tau;&rho;&alpha;) petra, meaning &quot;stone&quot;, and (ἰ&chi;ώ&rho;) īchōr, the fluid that flows in the veins of the gods in Greek mythology.<br/><br/>Welcome to the lush world of Petrichor; you are a cloud. Your entire purpose in life is to expand, sire other clouds and water crops. Unfortunately, your mates (who are also clouds) have a similar plan. It&rsquo;s up to you to manipulate the weather and assimilate these rogue clouds to contribute to the growth of as many crops as possible - all in order to claim the title of Most Valuable Cloud.<br/><br/>Petrichor is a highly interactive board game, playable by 1-4 people (up to 5 with the expansion, see below). It&rsquo;s an action selection/area influence game, with 4 simple actions which interact with the various fields in ever surprising ways. The players move clouds with water droplets, and then rain those droplets onto specific fields, to make sure they have the right amount of water for the Harvest. During a Harvest, crops that have been watered enough are scored! Players are able to influence when, and how often the harvest happens. Players need to strike a fine balance between maintaining control of the different fields as well as influencing Harvest, to make sure the two come together at the optimal time.<br/><br/>This Collector's Edition comes with a new Artwork and includes the Flower, Honeybee, Greener Pasture Expansion.<br/><br/>",

Queen Gimnax sent you to this cursed place with the fruits of a past expedition: the torn scraps of a map, partially finished by another cartographer who did not survive the journey.   Now it&rsquo;s up to you to finish mapping the Frozen Expanse with the work of an  ill-fated guildfellow to guide your way.<br/><br/>Cartographers: Map Pack 4, Frozen Expanse can be played with either Cartographers: A Roll Player Tale or Cartographers Heroes.<br/><br/>It includes 75 double-sided new map sheets featuring above pre-scouted spaces and a frozen lake, two new ambush cards, and one new hero card. Players must plan carefully while adhering to new terrain placement requirements and can earn a large bonus for surrounding a lake.<br/><br/>",

        "description": "In Mississippi Queen, players race their paddle wheelers down the Mississippi, picking up passengers along the way. But onboard coal supplies are limited, so each ship's acceleration and maneuvers must be carefully planned. The twists and turns of the river are unknown at the start of the game and are revealed only as ships progress downstream, so captains need to be alert at the wheel and ready to change course.<br/><br/>This version of Mississippi Queen includes the original base game that won the 1997 Spiel des Jahres as well as ''The Black Rose'' expansion that increased the player count to six and included the &quot;Black Rose&quot;, a black paddle wheeler controlled by whichever player is currently in last place. This boat does not require any coal and can be used to hamper opponents in the lead.<br/><br/>The game has basic rules that more or less reflect gameplay in the original game, along with advanced rules that introduce elements such as floating logs and sand bars that were included in The Black Rose expansion.<br/><br/>",

        "description": "from GMT website:<br/><br/>Eighth Air Force is a fast-action card game that allows players to experience the tension and thrill of aerial combat over Europe during World War II. Eighth Air Force provides players with the major fighter and bomber aircraft flown by the German, British, Russian and United States air forces. You'll experience the dawn of the jet age with the introduction of the German Me-262; the pressure of leading British Lancaster heavy bomber formation at night; and the maximum effort needed to sustain the wings of the United States Eighth Air Force.<br/><br/>Included are six new Air Campaigns from the early U.S. Air Force Daylight Bombing missions of 1942 to the Royal Air Force Night Bombing missions of 1944. Also included are four famous air operations: the British Dam Busters Raid of 1943; the German 1942-43 Stalingrad Airlift; the Eighth Air Force Schweinfurt Raids of 1943; and Operation Blue Monday, the destruction of the V-1 and V-2 rocket launch sites.<br/><br/>Note: To play Eighth Air Force, you need a copy of Rise of the Luftwaffe, Volume One in the Down in Flames Series.<br/><br/><br/>BGG description:<br/><br/>Eighth Air Force extends Rise of the Luftwaffe to the second half of World War II: 1942-1945.  It adds jets, altitude, heavy cannon and bombers.  The rule book is designed to supersede Rise of the Luftwaffe's, with the additions peculiar to Eighth Air Force discreetly marked in the margins.<br/><br/>Of the remaining Down in Flames series, Zero!: The Rise and Fall of The Imperial Japanese Air Force Dec 1941 - June 1942 was published in 2001 and covers the Pacific theatre of the first half of WW2.  Corsairs and Hellcats is the 4th game in the series (Pacific theatre, 1942-1945). Flying Circus (WW1) has been mentioned as a similar game set during WWI, but it is not listed on the GMT Games website.<br/><br/>",

Queen Gimnax built a prison over this sacred site during the Great War, enclosing those ghosts and their treasure behind its walls.<br/><br/>Some say the catacombs lead to the tomb of Khathandor, greatest of the Dragul warriors.

To find the truth, you&rsquo;ll have to send your seeker to explore the crumbling catacombs by lantern light.<br/><br/>New opportunities await you above ground, too, as you influence the legendary characters who inhabit the prison.

        "description": "From Boardgame News Spiel 2008 Preview:<br/><br/>Container: The Second Shipment includes four different expansions that can be mixed and matched as players want. These expansions are:<br/><br/>Luxury Containers &mdash; In addition to the other containers, players add 12, 16, or 20 gold luxury containers to the supply. As a pre-turn action, a player can convert two containers in his factory or harbor to a gold container, pricing it as he wishes. Luxury containers are worth twice the number of luxury containers that a player collects, so one luxury container is worth 2, two containers are worth 8 (4 each), three are worth 18 (6 each), and so on.<br/><br/>Factory and Warehouse Restrictions &mdash; These two expansions work similarly, consisting of sets of cards that are stacked in a particular order. As you build more factories (or warehouses), a new restriction card takes effect, limiting the prices at which you can offer containers. In effect, these cards mimic economies of scale, allowing players to drop prices as they invest more in infrastructure.<br/><br/>Financiers &mdash; Players can now loan money directly to others, allowing them to earn the interest previously paid to the bank. A player who is looking for financing doesn't have to accept a loan offered by another player, but if she doesn't, then she must pass on borrowing money at all that turn. Competing Financiers may sweeten the deal by offering bigger loans for the same interest payment. Someone who defaults on a loan from another player will typically lose a container, factory, or warehouse to the lender to repay the debt.<br/><br/>Monopoly &mdash; A single player can now have more than one factory of the same color, potentially monopolizing production of a container type.<br/><br/>",

You've promised him riches if he helps you become the next ruler of Valeria. His hoe is his only weapon and a barrel lid is his only armor. His meager carrot harvest still rests in his coat pocket as he marches off to battle.<br/><br/>Within the shadow of Mt. Ostendaar lives a warrior race that has honed the craft of alchemy. Their Knights have joined the battle against the hordes of fiery demons that are spilling out of the once dormant volcano. This eager young Knight wields a sharp spear and spiked chain mace against the foes of Valeria. Potion &quot;grenades&quot; tied to her armor are her secret weapon.<br/><br/>This expansion was included in the Kickstarted expansion, Flames and Frost.<br/><br/>",

A series of Exploration cards dictate which rooms and areas the heroes encounter, ensuring that you&rsquo;ll never play the same game twice.<br/><br/>In the Dark Elements expansion, the overlord is replaced by an overlord track and a deck of monster activation cards, which control the monsters you encounter. Your heroes must battle through waves of monsters to escape your fate, but you still have a chance to gain experience and grab items along the way. Dark Elements simulates a mini campaign in one night, offering all the excitement and adventure of Descent in a fully cooperative environment.<br/><br/>Important: The Lair of the Wyrm expansion is required to play the Dark Elements cooperative adventure.<br/><br/>",

        "description": "The Shadow Goblins come from the other side of The Portal! Which Portal will you ask? As you know, the Dark Goblins that you discovered in the main game have a trapping power. When they use it, as you may see on some artworks, the trapped goblin is in effect thrown out through The Portal. For decades now, returning goblins have reported having encountered members of a mysterious and frightening goblin clan &hellip; The Shadow Clan!<br/><br/>These goblins are very similar to the Dark Goblins, mainly because of the two powers they have in common: Trapping and Zombie Mutation.<br/><br/>These new goblins will also bring along two new types of gameplay. First of all, some of these goblins will arrive in play already trapped, compensating for a greater power. Secondly, other goblins will introduce a new kind of action during his turn, like [*Trap Z&auml;xg* : Choose 1 FREE card then destroy it.]. In this example, your action will be to trap Z&auml;xg for free in order to destroy a card. This action is free and only requires the trapping of the goblin card having the power.<br/><br/>From the designer's website: <a target='_blank' href=\"http://www.moonstergames.com/2010/10/06/gosu-les-gobelins-de-lombre-the-shadow-goblins/\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer noopener\">http://www.moonstergames.com/2010/10/06/gosu-les-gobelins-de...</a><br/><br/>Online Play<br/><br/><br/>     Board Game Arena (real-time)<br/><br/><br/>",

With a sweet little boy to protect from the forces of the Fall, Pokey and Manny must learn the ropes from the beloved original cast and face a slate of new monsters from under the bed!<br/><br/>The Stuffed Fables: Oh, Brother! expansion includes a new storybook, with new challenges, enemies, and fables, along with new tokens, sleep cards, and its own discovery deck to lead you through each unique adventure, but you will need components from the Stuffed Fables base game in order to play.<br/><br/>In addition to everything else, Pokey the Unicorn and Manny the Action Figure join the cast, adding their unique abilities to the team. Pokey doesn't equip any weapon items, but instead uses her Puffy Horn to fend off enemies. Manny, as a macho action figure, is made of strong plastic instead of the usual stuffing of other characters, so certain status conditions don't affect him as they would a typical stuffy.<br/><br/>Can you protect your little boy from the dangers of the supernatural fall?<br/><br/>",

Place the castle on any castle space on your player board (The A side is better for beginners, the B side for advanced players). Take 3 random goods and put them next to the board. In solo game there is no restriction for the number of different types (= colors) of goods that you can collect.<br/><br/>Choose a color and take both playing pieces and dice of that color, plus the white die. Place one of your pieces on space 0 of the victory point track as a victory point counter and the other piece on the 50 as target marker. Continue setting up the game as usual for a 2-player game (hex tiles, goods, etc.)<br/><br/>PLAYING THE GAME<br/>You are playing 25 rounds. At the beginning of each round, throw all 3 dice:<br/><br/>- First, take the topmost goods tile and place it on the depot indicated by the white die.<br/><br/>- Then remove a hex tile from that depot from the game, starting from the top to bottom (depots 2, 3, 5 and 6) or left to right (depots 1 and 4) respectively. If a depot is empty, remove a hex tile from the next depot in clockwise order etc.<br/><br/>Next, perform your 2 dice actions as usual, with the same effects and victory point gains as in the base game, except for the following restrictions and changes:<br/><br/>- You can only expand to other territories via the rivers.<br/><br/>- Whenever you place a ship, take all goods from a depot of your choice, then immediately remove all other goods from all other depots from the game.<br/><br/>In addition, you now (and only now!) have the option to exchange any 5 of your goods for a single tile from the black depot (the 5 goods tiles are removed from the game). Place that tile face down (i.e. its black side up) on one of your three storage spaces. A &quot;black tile&quot; can be placed on any color space on your board, as long as you follow the base game placement rules. Placing a black tile helps you to complete a region (to gain victory points, a color bonus and for winning the game) but has no other effects.<br/><br/>For example: a &quot;black mine&quot; won't generate Silverlings at the beginning of the phase. A &quot;black ship&quot; gains neither goods nor the option to exchange 5 goods for a &quot;black tile&quot;.<br/><br/>- Victory points from a yellow Knowledge tile are added immediately after placing it (instead of at the end of the game).<br/><br/>- You won't gain victory points as color bonus when completing a color. Instead, choose a tile from the black depot and place it directly on the board, with all its effects, following the base game placement rules. If that completes another color, take an additional tile from the black depot (if available), place it on your board, etc.<br/><br/>- Whenever you gain victory points, move your victory point counter that many spaces. In addition you may buy now further victory points. Each victory point costs 1 Silverling.<br/><br/>When your victory point counter reaches the target victory point marker, put it back on space 0 (any remaining victory points are lost), then move the target marker down 5 space (e.g. from 50 to 45, next time to 40 etc).<br/>Immediately after resetting the victory point counter you may carry out a dice action of your choice (just as if you had added a castle to your estate).<br/><br/>END OF THE GAME<br/>You win the game if you manage to occupy all 37 hex spaces of your estate within 25 rounds.<br/><br/>",

        "description": "Eclipse: Black Hole is a mini-expansion for Eclipse that consists of two black hole hexes and a flux wormhole discovery tile. During set-up, shuffle one of the black hole hexes with the other Outer Sector hexes. When a ship lands on the black hole, roll a die to determine whether the ship returns to play immediately (and takes one damage) or returns to play after 1-2 rounds. When the ship returns to play, it comes back on any Inner Sector hex or any hex with at least one wormhole pointing to empty space, with the effect dependent on which black hole hex is in the game.<br/><br/>With the flux wormhole discovery tile, you can place it on the edge between any two hexes to connect them with a full wormhole, thereby making each of them worth one extra VP at game's end.<br/><br/>",

Many actions require the the use of your influence to gain attributes in a one-of-a-kind heroic attribute alchemy system, which is leveraged to gain the game's most powerful rewards. For example, you can meditate at a spire to gain inspiration. You can train at a fort to gain strength. But then you can combine your inspiration and strength to gain the courage (inspired strength) which allows you to perform a bounty hunt.<br/><br/>There are distinctive end-game triggers that can be affected through game play, unique card abilities that can be merged in unusual ways for potent combinations, and fresh tile placement each game for high replay-ability.<br/><br/>The Archive of the Ancients edition of Vindication includes the following previously existing content:<br/><br/>Vindication&nbsp;<br/>    Vindication: Leaders &amp; Alliances<br/>    Vindication: Chronicles<br/>    Vindication: Villages &amp; Hamlets Module Collection<br/>    Vindication: Odyssey Module (from the Odyssey World Box)<br/>    Community Promo Pack (2021)<br/>    Wintertide Promo Pack (2020)<br/>    Community Promo Pack (2019)<br/>    OG Promo Pack (2018)<br/>    BGR Promo Pair (2021)<br/>    Man Vs Meeple Promo Pair (2020)<br/>    The Dice Tower Promo Pair (2019)<br/>    Board Game Spotlight Promo Pair (2019)<br/>    Metal Threshold Medallions<br/>    OG Boulder Hulk Promotional Miniature<br/>    Boulder Hulk Awakened Promotional Miniature<br/><br/>",

With Raythen in your company, you'll get a second chance to reroll attribute tests and possibly snatch up search tokens faster than ever before.<br/><br/>On the other hand, when you play as the overlord, Raythen's &quot;Skulduggery Plot&quot; deck can help you get the better of the heroes and allow you to use Raythen's specialized skills for evil. You'll be able to steal search tokens with your monsters and keep the best treasures out of the heroes' hands with cards like &quot;Foiled Again&quot;.

        "description": "The first battle pack,The Skavenblight Threat, saw the emergence of the diseased and squabbling Skaven. Now their forces are bolstered. The newest battle pack, Path of the Zealot, sees their chittering horde grow. Poison Wind Globadiers rain death upon the heads of their opponents, as they can corrupt to deal damage. The Chittering Horde tactic brings more Skaven into your fold, as it allows you to search a portion of your deck for ratmen recruits.<br/><br/>Not to be outdone, the forces of Order gain the assistance of the Zealot Hunter, who destroys that which doesn&rsquo;t belong upon entering play. He brings with him the capricious Veteran Sellswords, who change sides with each passing moment.<br/><br/>The starmetal known as Gromril has been a part of Dwarf lore for as long as the mountains have sheltered them. Now it emerges onto the battlefield, to shield the sons of Grungi. The Gate of Sigmar bars the entrance into one of the most populated cities in the Empire, and the staring skulls carved into the doors greet any invader as they crash against its might. Each turn, it shall do the same for you and keep damage from reaching your noble home.<br/><br/>Every zone sees new additions, and players will be forced to re-evaluate their plans. Will you devote the newest Empire hero, Gustav the Bear, to protecting your newly built Kingdom, or will he assist you in further developing your Quest zone? Dwarf Miners are an excellent unit to bring in later in the game. Their ability to &ldquo;fix&rdquo; the part of your capital they enter can be a game saver, especially in the often targeted Quest zone. The deadly Bloodsworn make an excellent protector for damaged zones, as each opposing figure that falls restores their health.<br/><br/>Speaking of the Quest Zone, a new Quest appears for the foul followers of Chaos, as they can now show themselves to be the Wolves of the North. Rumor has it that Valkia has personally found this quest to be most rewarding...<br/><br/>The Path of the Zealot also increases the number of High Elves and Dark Elves, as the war spills over into their lengthy lives. The Repeater Bolt Thrower launches a wave of indirect damage at your foe, and gets stronger the more developed you are. Vaul&rsquo;s Unmaking removes the weapons from the hands of the enemy and leaves them with nothing. Dark Elves call upon dark powers and pul the very blood from their foes. Call the Blood can remove a damaged unit from play, a nasty surprise for the foes of Malekith. Dark Riders, wielding wicked swords, charge down upon those foolish enough to be in their way.<br/><br/>This fall shall see some of the fiercest battles and desperate races to develop mighty empires. Legends will be forged. Will you be one of them?<br/><br/>",

You'll have to master the arts of Jousts and Tournaments, complete dangerous Quests, and polish your Education. You'll also have to serve the king, and show that you have a sense of Charity and Gallantry. Only one of you will be knighted by King Arthur, so it's time to show what you&rsquo;re capable of.&quot; &mdash;Father Advevan Nicolus Emilius, chairman of the Medieval Academy.<br/><br/>In Die Holde Isolde, a &quot;family+&quot; game, each player takes the role of a squire who wants to outdo the others in the different training categories to score Chivalry Points. To achieve this goal, during the six turns of the game, the players must wisely draft the cards that are the most useful to them and play them at the right time to move their discs up the training tracks.<br/><br/>At the end of turn VI, the squire who has the most Chivalry Points wins the game and is knighted by King Arthur!<br/><br/>Die Holde Isolde consists of both the Medieval Academy base game and the Galantry and Magic mini-expansions.<br/><br/>",

        "description": "One of the most powerful mid-level ships in the Galactic Civil War, the MC30c frigate was of Mon Calamari design and presented a lethal combination of speed, high-powered armament, and advanced deflector shields. The trade-off, however, was that the ship was relatively light on hull plating. This trade-off becomes evident, as well, in the MC30c Frigate Expansion Pack, which offers this ship to the Rebel Alliance as a fast, nimble, small-size vessel that can fire as many as five attack dice from its left and right hull zones. However, to do so, it must get within close range of enemy ships where its shields won't long protect it from taking damage against its four hull points.<br/><br/>In addition to its pre-painted MC30c frigate miniature, this expansion pack contains two command dials and ten upgrade cards, along with all the tokens you need to bring this Rebel ship to battle. Of course, as with other Armada expansion packs, the MC30c Frigate Expansion Pack also comes with two ship cards that let you field your MC30c as either the MC30c Scout Frigate or MC30c Torpedo Frigate. Though they share many of the same design elements, the different costs and battery armaments of these two different configurations ensure a wide range of tactical flexibility for your MC30c.<br/><br/>",

If a player builds a vegetable patch, they can grow vegetables in the form of small wooden cubes on it &mdash; and once they have enough vegetables, they can buy unique items with powerful abilities from the villagers at the market, such as the Crafting Table that can transform any stone into an emerald, i.e., a wild. With the Minecart with Chest, you can always take three blocks instead of two. The Beacon allows a player three actions each turn instead of two, and the Enchanting Table grants 20 experience points at game's end.<br/><br/>Items are revealed in the market at the start of the game, as well as after the first and second scorings, and they're first come, first serve, so grow your crops quickly to make the best use of them.<br/><br/>",

A separate card from this pack is used as the starting tile, displaying 2 &quot;blocks&quot; from those terrains included in each game respectively.<br/><br/>On a player's turn, they draw 1 card from each game deck and must choose 1 to play and 1 to discard. In this way, both game decks with run out at the same rate. End game occurs after the last 2 cards are drawn and played/discarded.<br/><br/>Players score for the largest 2 block groups from each game, lose points for individual roads, and score/lose points according to the 3 scoring condition cards.<br/><br/>&mdash;description from the publisher<br/><br/>",

Though somewhat antiquated, the ship was still a force to be reckoned with, featuring powerful cannons, heavy shielding, and a tail gunner. The ARC-170 Expansion Pack introduces this starfighter to X-Wing as a resilient vessel with two attack, an auxiliary firing arc, and both crew and astromech upgrade slots. Additionally, four ship cards introduce Poe Dameron's mother Shara Bey and three other aces while nine new upgrades permit a wide range of creative configurations.<br/><br/>",

Over the course of eight rounds, they'll double their workforce, open up new living space in the mountain, construct new buildings and rooms in which to live, and dig for precious metals.<br/><br/>In more detail, each player starts the game with an individual player board that's covered with a random assortment of face-down building/room tiles and only one space. Some tiles are face up and available for purchase at the start of play. Four action tiles lie face up as well. At the start of each of the eight rounds, one new action tile is revealed, then players alternate taking actions, with the number of actions increasing from two up to four over the course of the game. As players excavate their mountainous player board, new building and room tiles are added to the pool; some rooms can be used immediately when acquired, whereas others require the use of an action tile.<br/><br/>After eight rounds, players tally their points for buildings constructed and gold collected to see who wins.<br/><br/>In Caverna: Cave vs Cave – Era II, players start exploring a side cave abundant in ore. Donkeys help you move the ore to the surface so that you can cast iron and forge weapons out of it &mdash; to protect your cave from anyone who wishes it harm, of course. In the meantime, your tribe has grown four primates capable of work. Keep on collecting grains, fibers, and building resources to increase your wealth. Shortly you will be engaging in agriculture...<br/><br/>Caverna: Cave vs Cave &ndash; The Big Box contains all of the material in the base game and first expansion in a single package.<br/><br/>",

The deck features a slightly higher average Fate value per card, giving him potent discards as suits his family's wealth. The killer app? His Inner Demon stunt lets him play the top card of his deck for free. If luck's on your side, it can be a real game-changer.<br/><br/>Waldo Butters' deck uses his incisive intellect to take advantages and investigate cases. Not making enough progress on your cases? With his talents as a Forensic Pathologist, Waldo can turn your hits into clues. (And yes&mdash;you'll get to play a Polka Will Never Die!)<br/><br/>Round all that up with two new book decks based on books #6 and #7, Blood Rites and Dead Beat &mdash; along with a few more Side Jobs cards &mdash; and you'll add tons of new team combinations and hours more of potential for play. And, yes: we'll have Sue in there (as a potent Advantage card&mdash;she'll be our signature image for Dead Beat's advantages, in fact), along with plenty more Foes (individually illustrated thanks to the latest funded stretch!), Cases, Obstacles, and Advantages arrayed in new, exciting, dismaying ways.<br/><br/>",

        "description": "For centuries, the armies of the Great Houses have fought to reclaim the glory of the fallen Star League, sending regiments of their elite MechWarriors into battle across hundreds of worlds as humanity slid inexorably toward a new Dark Age. The coming of the Clans &ndash; descendants of the lost Star League army &ndash; did little to stem the slaughter.<br/><br/>It only raised the stakes.<br/><br/>BattleTech: Alpha Strike is a fast-playing form of the BattleTech game of futuristic, armored combat. Developed for the modern tabletop miniatures wargamer, this book brings players the ability to wage war on land, sea, and air using the Quick-Strike game system in BattleTech: Strategic Operations. BattleTech: Alpha Strike, like its forerunner Quick-Strike, draws upon a hybridization of the BattleForce rules also available in Strategic Operations, together with the miniature game rules presented in that same volume which allow for hexless terrain play. BattleTech: Alpha Strike includes support for both hex-based and hexless game play.<br/><br/>In BattleTech: Alpha Strike, themed around the Clan Invasion, each BattleMech (or other game unit) is represented using a series of Unit Cards, which are highly abstracted derivations of the respective Record Sheet for each unit in &quot;classic&quot; BattleTech. (While BattleForce uses the same abstraction to group 'Mechs into lances, Stars, centuries, or level IIs, BattleTech: Alpha Strike should treat each 'Mech as an individual unit.)<br/><br/>As with &quot;classic&quot; BattleTech, a player's goal is to use his force to achieve his objectives, which generally involves the defeat or destruction of opposing forces. However, the game's use of BattleForce Unit Cards and rule options allow it to play at a much faster (though less intricately detailed) level of play than &quot;classic&quot; BT. Complete with sample armies and a ready-to-play campaign system, all you need besides this book are dice, miniatures, and tabletop terrain to fight for control over the Inner Sphere on land, sea, and air &ndash; one world at a time!<br/><br/>",

The second battle pack, The Path of the Zealot, brought new forces for the Skaven and the witch hunters. Now, new heroes are rising to do battle with the growing rat menace.<br/><br/>The might of Gurni Thorgrimson and Ugrok Beardburna explode on the scene. Gurni gets more deadly with each attachment he is given. Ugrok takes the berserk ability to a new level, gaining a point of power for each damage on him. Empire Reiksguard Swordsmen are a powerful ally with their Counterstrike capabilities, and Dark Elf Cold One Chariots get bigger with each development put into play. Chaos and High Elves each gain new units to lay waste to their foes.<br/><br/>The Skaven will not give up the gains they have acquired and are bringing to bear the power and ferocity of the Rat Ogres and Gutter Runners. Rat Ogres can allow you to get more out of your Skaven units, and the terrifying Clan Moulder Elite Rat Ogres are solid walls of muscle that can overwhelm many a foe.<br/><br/>Empires rise and fall, and they require development and support if they are to last. The Scout Camp can provide you new options, and the Anvil of Doom assists the forces of Order by improving the quality of their weapons and armour. Each side will be forced to employ new tactics in an ever-shifting tide of battle and kingdom-building. Mob Up lets the Orcs see the fruits of their fighting, without that annoying Order ability to cancel damage getting in the way. Grasping Darkness gives the Dark Elves control of a unit with low power, if but for an instant. Lastly, Reap What&rsquo;s Sown gives vast power to those who build up their lands.<br/><br/>War has arrived. Blood has been shed. Many lives on both sides have been lost. New power is coming. Are you strong enough to finish the fight?<br/><br/>",

It's known as the Savage Mountain, as it kills one person for every four who have reached the summit... Now your team stands in its shadow, ready to climb for fame and glory.<br/><br/>K2 is a board game in which each player controls a team of 2 mountaineers, trying to climb to the summit of K2 and return before the other players' teams and before the mountain kills them. Every player uses an identical deck of cards. You use the cards to move your climbers on the route pictured on the gaming board, or to acclimatize the members of your team. <br/>You can also set up a tent and wait for better weather. You will have to choose your path carefully, as the other mountaineers can block your way, and watch the upcoming weather which can lower your acclimatization to 0, thus killing your climbers.<br/>K2 is a hand management game for 1-5 players, with strong interaction and low luck factor, lasting up to 60 minutes. The theme is very well represented by the mechanics, including such elements as changing weather, lack of oxygen and death of the mountaineers. The result is an exciting match for gamers and non-gamers alike.<br/>The box includes, among other materials, a double-sided board with two different routes to the summit (easier and harder) and two sets of weather tiles (for summer and winter).<br/><br/>&mdash;description from the publisher<br/><br/>",

Meanwhile, the desperate fight on the desolate ice planet of Hoth is destined to have tremendous repercussions throughout the galaxy.

This Force Pack could witness the end of the Rebel Alliance, or it could open an opportunity for its noble spies and smugglers to conduct critical espionage while the Empire's eyes are turned toward Hoth.

        "description": "With new book decks Proven Guilty and White Night, you'll get even more variation in your options for play. As a pair of decks, these ones are particularly interesting in the Showdown, where you'll only get to spend Fate and roll for either Cases (in Proven Guilty) or Foes (in White Night). If you want to defeat your Foes or clear your Cases, you'll need to do so before you get to the respective Showdowns. And that's just the added challenge of the Showdowns for this deck &mdash; each one has its own new challenges, obstacles, and card interactions to give a different texture of play, as every scenario deck does.<br/><br/>But, you're probably most excited about the new character decks. And these ones are great! Both have an interesting relationship to the core game's Michael Carpenter deck.<br/><br/>Sanya's deck has a Hand of Hope Stunt that pulls a case close and adds clues to it &mdash; a kind of inverse of Michael's Stunt that knocks a foe far away and adds hits. It's that moment in the novel when Sanya shows up, helps an injured Harry get up on his feet, and says something Russian and profound that triggers a breakthrough on the case. And as the Knight of Hope, Sanya'sTalent offers a simple but powerful benefit of increased Fate Point payouts when discarding for fate, helping everyone on the team breathe just a bit easier.<br/><br/>Molly Carpenter's deck, meanwhile, mirrors her dad's in another way: like Michael's Talent, hers must be &quot;readied&quot; by a discard before it can be used. On a subsequent turn, you can flip the readied card back over to alter one of the dice you roll when you play a card. About half of Molly's cards involve a dice roll of one kind or another, so this is a powerful engine for optimizing your plays. But perhaps even more potent is her stunt, which lets you copy another player's currently-unused stunt! Need to double up on Harry's foe-finisher or Karrin's fate-harvester? Maybe summon an extra (if illusory) pack of werewolves to chew on injured foes, or get your Toe-Moss on to play the top card of your deck? Grasshopper is here to to help. Whatever your team can do, she can do &mdash; the power of a Talented Holomancer.<br/><br/>Speaking from personal experience, both decks are a ton of fun to play and add exciting new options and strategies as you take on your scenario of choice.<br/><br/>",

        "description": "Shadows of Brimstone: Blasted Wastes Expansion<br/><br/>An inhospitable and corrosive alien desert, the Blasted Wastes is a distant planet used as a prison world by nearby alien civilizations, marooning their worst criminals on the surface with no hope of escape! Though most sent to the wastes are consumed by the deadly creatures that live under the sand, or fall victim to the burning suns, sulfur acid pools, or toxic Dark Stone dust storms, those that survive eke out a living by forming vicious warbands to scavenge the desert dunes, searching for resources and the countless alien treasures buried beneath the burning sands.<br/><br/>This Expansion introduces a brand new OtherWorld full of alien terrors, Wasteland Scavengers, and deadly desert hazards!<br/><br/>Included are a full set of 18 Map Tiles for the Blasted Wastes world (with another new 'Earth-based' world on the back - The Canyons), all of the cards needed for both of these new worlds, 4 deadly new Enemy Types (6 Wasteland Scavengers, 3 Sand Crabs, 3 Wasteland Warlords/Heavies, and 6 Tribal Ghost Warriors), as well as a brand new alien Barter Town that Heroes can visit in the Wastes!<br/><br/>",

Players form two partnerships: the USA and West Germany versus the USSR and East Germany. However, there can be only ONE winner! This fact makes every decision a nail-biter: What is more important right now? Your side's interests or your own?<br/><br/>The forty new action cards add events like the Cuban Missile Crisis and the SALT treaties. The range of strategic choices is significantly wider, making 2+2 a completely different game. As a superpower, you want to gain global dominance, win the space race, and increase your living standards to demonstrate the superiority of your system. Never let the other side get too far ahead in the arms race. Subtly manipulate your partner's choices, but don't hesitate to sabotage their plans outright if necessary. Most importantly, always remember the need for world peace, for otherwise there might be no tomorrow...<br/><br/>",

To travel to the Capital or venture out to the devastated areas for resources, players need not only various Specialists (Engineers, Scientists, Administrators, and Geniuses) but also Exosuits to protect and enhance them &mdash; and both are in short supply.<br/><br/>The game is played in 4-7 turns, depending on the time when the looming cataclysm occurs (unless, of course, it is averted!). The elapsed turns are measured on a dynamic Timeline. By powering up the Time Rifts, players can reach back to earlier turns to supply their past &quot;self&quot; with resources. Each Path has a vastly different objective that rewards it with a massive amount of Victory Points when achieved. The Paths' settlements will survive the impact, but the Capital will not. Whichever Path manages to collect most points will be the new seat for the Capital, thus the most important force left on the planet...<br/><br/>As stretch goals to the Kickstarter campaign, four Leader Boxes were available as expansions to the base game.  Each Leader box contained everything from the Follower box, plus the Pioneers of New Earth module, the Exosuit miniatures -- all in an exclusive box sleeve based on a chosen Path affiliation.  The four Path affiliations were:  Path of Dominance, Path of Progress, Path of Salvation, and Path of Harmony.<br/><br/>",

Er kommuniziert direkter als andere Geister, indem er seine hohen Triller mit Ebenen von Gedanken &uuml;berlagert. Manchmal hilft er Seelen gestorbener Dahan auf ihrem Weg, bevor b&ouml;sartige Geister sie verschlingen k&ouml;nnen. Obwohl er allgegenw&auml;rtig ist, bleibt er r&auml;tselhaft. Sogar die Dahan, die ihn den Wegbereiter nennen, sind sich nicht sicher, ob er wirklich neue Wege erschafft oder findet, was bereits da ist. Ist die Parallelwelt, durch die er sich bewegt, &uuml;berhaupt r&auml;umlich oder eine andere Daseinsform? Die Gedanken, die er kommuniziert, sind so fremdartig, dass sie sich nur schwer in Worte fassen lassen.<br/><br/>Finder unsichtbarer Wege ist ein zus&auml;tzlicher Geist f&uuml;r Spirit Island mit sehr hoher Komplexit&auml;t Dieser Geist bewegt die meiste Zeit Invasoren und manchmal Dahan, Pr&auml;senzen oder Tiere. Dadurch (und durch reichlich Isolieren) kann er gut invasorenfreie, &bdquo;sichere&ldquo; Zonen schaffen. Ohne eine M&ouml;glichkeit vernichtete Pr&auml;senzen zur&uuml;ck ins Spiel zu bringen, kann er es sich nur selten leisten, Invasoren zu zerst&ouml;ren. Daher ben&ouml;tigt er eine passende Starke F&auml;higkeit &ndash; oder Mitspieler, die ihn bei Angriffen unterst&uuml;tzen. Da er die Topologie der Insel &auml;ndert, steigert sich die Komplexit&auml;t f&uuml;r alle Spieler &ndash; vor allem in gr&ouml;&szlig;eren Spielen!&ldquo;<br/><br/>",

Here, among the sketchy chop shops planted in the shadow of Haas-Bioroid&rsquo;s genetics division, a growing community of chromeheads have begun to transform cybernetics into fashion statements.<br/><br/>If the surgery&rsquo;s good, the latest cybernetics don&rsquo;t just make you trendy; they also make you smarter, stronger, and more resilient. But a bad chopper&rsquo;s just as likely to cause you irreparable brain damage as outfit you for the runways. Accordingly, Chrome City and its cybernetic hardware introduce a volatile mixture of risks and rewards, many of which are centered around protecting or damaging the Runner&rsquo;s brain.<br/><br/>",

        "description": "The Moloch State Pack is an expansion to 51st State: Master Set, which introduces a semi-cooperative experience.<br/>It consists of 27 Moloch cards to be shuffled in the Base Set cards and 23 double-sided Machine cards.<br/><br/>Each round a number of new enemy Machines are deployed and threaten all the players. Players may fight the Machines using two new actions, by hacking or destroying them.<br/><br/>Hacking a Machine requires to pay the resources indicated in the Machine&rsquo;s code, and lets the player who does the action flip the Machine&rsquo;s card and build it as their own location offering that player a new ability. Another way to fight a Machine is destroying it, which requires spending Contact tokens equal to Machine&rsquo;s defense level. It brings the player victory points.<br/><br/>If Machines are left in play, because no one hacked them or destroyed them, they will attack all players in the Assault phase and deal damage specified on the Machine&rsquo;s card. Players may choose to work together fighting the Machines or face the dangers alone.<br/><br/>-description from publisher<br/><br/>",

The game is played like normal, but now in addition to scoring the number of Xs in the four colored rows, you also score points for the black row that criss-crosses everything else, scoring for 0-11 Xs depending on how many spaces you mark.<br/><br/>With &quot;The Chain&quot;, each player takes a different scoresheet from A-E, and each of these scoresheets has numbers in adjacent spaces that are circled and connected by a line, such as the red 9 and the yellow 9 or the yellow 3 and the green 11. Whenever you X out one of the circles in a chain, then you automatically cross out the other circle in the chain &mdash; even if that color has been marked to the right of the circle or is finished. Now you have second chances to fill in spaces that might otherwise lie empty!<br/><br/>",
