        "description": "Legacy of Glory is a set of rules for fighting tactical Napoleonic battles. The preferred figure scale is 1:60 and the ground scale is 1&quot; = 50 meters. Play is divided into 2-hour Grand Battle Turns, with each Grand Battle Turn subdivided into six tactical turns. Players normally take the role of army and corps commanders, and receive a variable number of command points each Grand Battle Turn, the actual number being determined by the talent rating of the historical general they're representing and the roll of two 10-sided dice. Commanders issue orders to the units under them, with each order requiring a different number of command points. Once an order is issued, there's some delay before it can be executed. The minimum delay depends on distance between the commander issuing the order and the most distant unit affected by it, and there's a variable number of tactical turns of additional delay, dependent on the quality of the generals involved and the roll of two ten-sided dice, before the order actually gets carried out. The smallest units on the board are infantry battalions, cavalry regiments, and artillery batteries, but orders are issued only down to division (or elite brigade level).<br/><br/>Actions within a tactical turn are divided up into multiple phases, most of which are skipped in any particular turn because they don't apply (e.g., the infantry combat resolution phase is skipped if no infantry units are in melee this tactical turn). The designers state in the foreword that one of their objectives is that experienced players should be able to run wall-clock time and game time just about in synch--that is, a Grand Battle Turn should not take more than 2 hours to play, even at the hottest point in the battle.<br/><br/>The original rules came in a bookcase-sized box, and included a rulebook (with rating charts for units and generals, by nationality), three pages of combat charts, three sheets of thin board status markers, and a pair of different-colored 10-sided dice. An updated set of rules was supposed to be issued in 2000-2001, but appears to have fallen by the wayside. Some play test versions of the updated rules do exist.<br/><br/>These are NOT simple rules. They require a fair amount of knowledge of the Napoleonic period to play, since they reward historical formations and tactics and penalize certain forms of rule-lawyering. The ground scale requires a fair amount of playing area, enough that most historical battles could only be put on by a gaming club or run as a convention event.<br/><br/>",

        "description": "This set of rules are intended to cover the engagements that took place between 1861 and 1865 during the American Civil War. The location of the actions would be on the great rivers of the eastern seaboard of North America. Such rivers would be the James, Mississippi and Yazoo. The rules have been designed with the specific objective of providing a playable game that gives the flavour of the period by imparting the major features and generalising on lesser matters. A brief outline of the conflict would go as follows. The two sides were known as the confederates(CSA) and the Union(USA). The union tended to have a much larger fleet. At the outset the union fleet consisted of mainly wooden vessels. The confederates quickly built ironclads(armoured vessels with extremely thick armour). These ironclads quickly proved wooden ships to be greatly inferior. This was illustrated several times when a single confederate ironclad would scatter four or five wooden ships. The CSA ships tended to be conversions . The quality of engines, materials and armaments varied wildly often toward the poorer end. The USA soon fielded some excellent ironclads along the famous monitor design which overall were better ships than the long CSA Ram/Ironclads.<br/><br/>As far as guns were concerned there are a few generalities that may give the player more feel for the period. The principles of fire and effect fell into two ideals. The first ideal was that of &ldquo;punching&rdquo;. Punching was the concept of the round going through the armour and causing great damage inside. Battering was the concept of smashing against the armour so hard that the plates would break off or the force would be transmitted to the area beyond the armour. Both methods have merit but it is punching that rules modern day thinking now that such items as fused shells and very high velocity guns are available.<br/><br/>To play this game there is an amount of equipment to be assembled.<br/>1. Ships to 1/600th scale.<br/>2. Enough 15mm scale figures and guns to represent the gun deck of the ship.<br/>3. A piece of card or model to 13mm scale upon which to put the figures, thus showing the exact position.<br/>4. Hexagons inscribed in 5.5&rdquo; circles for movement purposes. (2 for each ship)<br/>6. Some ordinary 1-6 sided dice.<br/>7. Some scenery for sandbars and shore batteries.<br/>8. Paper to note down damage.<br/>9. A blue cloth or similar.<br/>10. Some friends with whom to play.<br/><br/>",

Each player in turn, breaks the stack somewhere to check the number. If it is a 1 you can place a chip on it, close the stack as you found it then break it somewhere (like a deck of cards, pick up half, place down, and put bottom half on top).<br/><br/>If, when you open the stack, you find a disc with your chip on it, you can break it a second time. If the second break reveals a disc 1 higher than the one your chip is on, you can move it. So, if you split the stack and find you chip on a 1 disc, you can split it again and if you find a 2 disc move the chip from the 1 to the 2. Either way you close the stack as you found it again and only if you moved a chip, break it somewhere again (to confuse others). If you reveal a disc on your first break which has your chip on a 3 you can remove it from the stack.<br/><br/>In this way you move chips from 1 to 2 to 3. Always trying to remember which discs you've seen and which you have not, and what's on them - in face of every successful player breaking the stack quickly and nimbly.<br/><br/>",

All but 4 cards are dealt to the players; the top card of the remaining 4 is turned up to determine trumps. One player leads to the first trick and may play any card in their hand. Succeeding players must follow these rules (in order) when playing: (1) Must play a card of the same suit that was led; (2) If player does not have the suit led, they must play a trump card; (3) If player cannot follow either rule (1) or (2), they may play any suit. In addition, once it is determined which of the three foregoing rules applies to a player, they, if possible, must play a card that has a higher numeric value than the highest-valued card already played to the trick. If they cannot play a higher card, then they may play any card that follows the applicable rule. When all players have one card left in their hands, the round ends. Each player&rsquo;s score is the number of tricks they caught times the numerical value of the &ldquo;Last Card&rdquo; remaining in their hand (thus the title of the game).<br/><br/>",

        "description": "Shaman King is a CCG that is based on the famous anime of the same name.<br/><br/>From the Publisher Rule Book:<br/><br/>&quot;Welcome to the world of the Shaman King TCGTM! In this game, players use their favorite shamans to fight one-on-one duels in order to crown a Shaman King. It&rsquo;s fast-paced and furious fun!<br/><br/>The Shaman King TCG is kind of like the traditional card game War. Like War, Shaman King TCG players don&rsquo;t have a hand of cards. Instead, players take turns flipping cards from the top of their decks and comparing their attacks. The Shaman King TCG is also different than War. When you play War, you only have one chance to match or defeat your opponent&rsquo;s attack. In the Shaman King TCG, you have three chances, represented by the three colored zones. In War, cards are free to play, but in the Shaman King TCG, cards cost furyoku to play. Watch your furyoku carefully, and you&rsquo;ll be successful.<br/><br/>The Shaman King TCG is easy to learn. Players take turns attacking their opponents with strike cards while defending against their opponent&rsquo;s attacks at the same time. If your opponent fails to stop your strike in each of his or her three zones, you score a point. The first person to score three points wins the game.<br/><br/>Strikes aren&rsquo;t the only thing you need to win a shaman duel. Sneaky tactics, represented by advantage cards, and help from one&rsquo;s friends, represented by teamwork cards, will mean the difference between winning and losing the game.<br/><br/>Each shaman also has a different set of signature moves that you can find on the special pull-out card inside the Shaman Chamber CardTM. These represent each shaman&rsquo;s powerful attacks and may only be played under certain conditions.&quot;<br/><br/>",

The novelty policeman-shaped spinner shows both the distance of allowed orthogonal movement and whether a 'road block' (an L-shaped fence) is added or removed from the board.  The physical construction of the board, where each intersection can hold a single peg from a fence, prevents players being completely blocked and having to wait on a lucky (1 in 3 chance) roll to remove a fence.  This is quite a simple way of restricting fence placement.<br/><br/>Although still a fairly simple roll-and-move race game, the addition of the fences adds some decisions, a bit like Quoridor with dice.<br/><br/>",

However Wickets has been designed so that anyone with little or no knowledge of Cricket can pick up the game and start playing and learning immediately.<br/><br/>Wickets is also a great educational tool that not only helps improve children's memories but will aid in their development of communication and social skills.<br/><br/>And the parents love the game because it can be played as a family unit away from computers and TV's.<br/><br/>",

        "description": "Renaissance Chess (also known as Rennchess) is a large board (10 ranks x 12 files) chess variant with each player fielding an army of 34 pieces.  The 16 pieces found in an orthodox chess set are present along with some very powerful new pieces such as the Prince (combines the movement of a Queen and Knight), the Nobleman (combines the movement of the Rook and Knight), the Archbishop (combines the movement of the Bishop and Knight), the Cavalier (a side-stepping Rook type), the Duke (a side-stepping Bishop type), the Page (combines the movement of a King and Knight), and the Squire (moves or leaps 1 or 2 squares in a straight line).<br/><br/>The castling rules of orthodox chess are abandoned, but pawns are still able to utilize en-passant capture and retain their two-step first move capability.  Pawns which reach the opponent's back rank must promote to a previously captured piece.  Foxes which reach the opponent's back rank may optionally promote to a Guard.<br/><br/>According to Eric Greenwood, the game's author (in an article on ChessVariants.org), the correct spelling of the game should be &quot;Renniassance&quot; (the first &quot;n&quot; doubled and the &quot;ai&quot; reversed).<br/><br/>",

The remaining 48 cards comprise the Minor Arcana, which is divided into four suits of 12 cards each.

John Ross for 2-6 players.<br/><br/>The game of RAM is played using a deck made up of the Minor Arcana, plus the Hacker (as a wild card).  The 21 remaining Major Arcana are used to create a grid of cards, some face-up and some face-down.  Through a series of Blackjack-style rounds, players manipulate the grid and win cards.  The first player to win five cards wins the game.<br/><br/>The rules for RAM are included on a card that comes with the deck are not available online.<br/><br/>",

        "description": "In Par Out Golf, two armchair golfers from Chico decided to swap traditional golf clubs and balls for wet-erase markers, ink, and a richly illustrated and laminated 18-hole championship game board course. By doing so they made golf portable (think family vacations, road trips and even around the office), accessible and incredibly easy to learn, even for someone who has never stepped foot on a real fairway.<br/><br/>Par Out Golf is challenging, exciting and incredibly unique, playing as inconsistently as the real sport thanks to a twist you'll never &quot;see&quot; coming! It puts you and your family in the middle of the action, competing in stroke play, match play, or one of the many variations that will continue to challenge and entertain round after round.<br/><br/>Best for ages 5 and up and from 1 to 4 players, Par Out Golf is filled with lighthearted competition as players shoot for the lowest score through the 18 stunningly illustrated holes on the course. Game play is easy to learn for the amateur or junior golfer, and still challenging for the pro requiring a strikingly similar level of skill and focus on every shot.<br/><br/>Best of all, this course can be played again and again! A simple wipe with a damp cloth is all it takes to get the greens and fairways ready for another round.<br/><br/>Par Out Golf is played on a set of spiral bound, laminated pages. Special &quot;wet-erase&quot; markers are used so the line is easy to draw, won't smudge, and very easy to erase. The rules are very, very close to the game of golf, complete with sand and water traps, obstacles and slopes. So close is it to &quot;real&quot; golf, you can play each of five classic variations of golf: stroke play, match play, tombstone play, and pro play.<br/><br/>Of the several skills you practice while playing Par Out Golf, a fascinating, and, to any golf player, significant challenge is learning how to visualize your shot. The more observant you are, the more capable you are at remembering the lay of the land, the more effectively you can imagine the exact amount of drive to put on the ball, the better you'll do. This, of course, is the essence of Par Out Golf. Like &quot;real&quot; golf, Par Out Golf challenges both mind and body. If you want to know more about the physical and cognitive aspects of the game, take a look at the thoughtfully written essay: Par Out Science 101 at <a target='_blank' href=\"http://www.paroutgolf.com\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer noopener\">www.paroutgolf.com</a>.<br/><br/>If you want, you can practice on the Driving Range (on another page) or use the 19th hole (on yet another page) to design your own. You can add your own obstacles, changing the difficulty of each hole, essentially making the game something you can play for-just-about-ever.<br/><br/>Par Out Golf is recommended for 1 to 4 players (it comes with four different wet-erase markers). If you must try before you buy, you can download the first three holes online.<br/><br/>",

        "description": "HardBall Wars is the &ldquo;brother&rdquo; to our football game, GridIron Wars. While I was designing GridIron Wars, an idea popped into my head<br/>regarding a similar method to resolve a baseball game. After putting the idea to paper and mailing it to a couple of trusted friends,<br/>HardBall Wars was born. HardBall Wars is simple enough for a child to learn, but robust enough to satisfy even the most veteran of baseball gamer.<br/><br/>Many may wonder, why a baseball game? Aren&rsquo;t there plenty of good ones already on the market? In short, the answer is yes. There are many<br/>fantastic baseball games on the market. With HardBall Wars, I&rsquo;m really not re-inventing the wheel. You&rsquo;ll never hear me tout the game as<br/>better or more realistic than any other game currently on the market.<br/><br/>However, having said that, I do feel like this game stands up well against any other baseball game in terms of what is truly most important,<br/>the &ldquo;fun factor&rdquo;. My testers and I have had an absolute blast playing the game. The unique batter-pitcher interface, combined with the X-<br/>Factor deck, makes the game unique and in my humble opinion very fun to play.<br/><br/>My philosophy with Downey Games has always been to price games as low as possible, making the games accessible to all. Most current baseball<br/>board games sell in the $50-$60 range. While that is reasonable to most, it does make it an expensive proposition to purchase multiple<br/>seasons or teams. With HardBall Wars, I&rsquo;ve purposely designed the game with a cost factor in mind. For that same $50 or $60 you&rsquo;ll be able<br/>to purchase multiple seasons of HardBall Wars. Also unlike other games, we strive to rate nearly every player who stepped foot on the field<br/>of play.<br/><br/>HardBall Wars is based upon a modified log5 method. That may not mean much to some, but using this method allows the pitcher and batter to<br/>&quot;Interact&quot; on every at-bat. Rather than a 50/50 model or a generic pitcher grade, with HardBall Wars you'll see the difference between<br/>pitchers and batters and their impact on the at-bat in a very visual way. You'll also immediately see the difference in righty/lefty<br/>matchups at the plate.<br/><br/>Fielding is not neglected in HardBall Wars. You'll see the difference between the gold glove shortstop and the lead gloved fielder not only<br/>in terms of errors committed but also the ability to turn hits into outs.<br/><br/>The most unique aspect of HardBall Wars is our introduction of the X-Factor Deck. And often times it can generate a lot of excitement.<br/><br/>Within the X-Factor deck just about anything you&rsquo;ve ever seen in a baseball game can take place. From run downs, appeals, dropped third<br/>strikes, rain delays, rain outs, ejections, brawls to even the extremely bizarre like the now famous Pine Tar incident&mdash;all are possible<br/>within the X-Factor Deck.<br/><br/>The deck is far more than just a Rare Play mechanism. There are many conditional events within the deck and even some very mundane plays.<br/><br/>The X-Factor deck simulates the events that happen in real life that as a tabletop gamer you don&rsquo;t often see in your own gaming. One can see<br/>something out of the ordinary in almost every baseball game in real life. And we have brought that to the tabletop through the use of the X<br/>-Factor Deck.<br/><br/>With HardBall Wars, the decisions as a manager are all yours. You decide when to steal bases. You decide when to Hit and Run or Sacrifice<br/>the runner to the next base. You'll make the call when to intentionally walk the opposition&rsquo;s slugger, or when to bring the infield in to<br/>cut down a runner at the plate. You'll make the call as when to attempt a squeeze bunt or play for the big inning. You'll make the call to<br/>bring in the lefty specialist to face the opposing left hand slugger, or stick with your right hand throwing starter. With HardBall Wars, you<br/>may even be ejected from the game! Nearly every situation that faces a major league skipper is replicated in the game.<br/><br/>The printed game features game charts printed in full-color, the season of your choice, 3 dice, a die-cut X-Factor deck also printed in full color, score sheets all packaged in a sturdy game box.<br/><br/>",

        "description": "Tarot Probability is played with cards 1-21 and the Excuse, or Fool, from a typical tarot deck.  Deal is determined randomly.  There are four phases in each round.  In the first phase, five cards are dealt.  The player to the dealer's left bids on how many tricks she can take.  Bidding continues for all players, clockwise, until the dealer is reached.  The dealer can then bid any number of cards, EXCEPT whatever number would make the total number of bids equal to the number of cards dealt.  For example, in the first phase of a four player game, player one bids 2, player two bids 0, and player three bids 2.  Player four can then bid any number but 1, as that would equal five total bids, which is the number of cards dealt.<br/><br/>The player sitting to the dealer's left also throws the first card.  Tricks are taken by the highest numerical card.  The Excuse can either be played as a &quot;win trick&quot; or &quot;lose trick&quot;.  Players who bid correctly gain 10 points, those one trick off from their bid score 0, those two tricks off score -10, those three tricks off score -20, those four tricks off score -30, and those five tricks off score -40.<br/><br/>Phases in odd numbered rounds are dealt as follows: 5 cards, 4 cards, 3 cards, 2 cards, and 1 card placed on the forehead for all players but the card holder to see.  Even numbered rounds are dealt as follows: 2 cards placed on the forehead, 3 cards, 4 cards, and 5 cards.  The deal changes between each round.  When 2 cards are placed on the forehead, cards are still played singly, with the first card chosen randomly.<br/><br/>Game length is variable, but typically ends after everyone has dealt twice.  The player with the most points wins.  In the event of a tie, a final two cards are dealt and placed on the foreheads of the tied players.  The final places are determined by the outcome of that hand.<br/><br/>",

After years of training in the war and magic arts, when they reach the age of 200 years, they are sent into the dangerous savage lands of the north-west to complete five challenges. Those who complete the toughest challenges will be the most successful that year and will earn the recognition of their tribe and a chance to learn from the greatest masters.<br/><br/>Fifth Challenge is a light adventure game for the Decktet card game-system where players have to complete five challenges of varying difficulty. As challenges are completed, players earn experience that will help complete tougher challenges later on. When a player completes the fifth challenge, points are tallied and the player that got the most points, completing the most difficult challenges, wins.<br/><br/>The rules can be read at: <a target='_blank' href=\"http://decktet.wikidot.com/game\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer noopener\">http://decktet.wikidot.com/game</a>:fifth-challenge<br/><br/>",

        "description": "Sun &amp; Moon is a building game designed for Stonehenge: An Anthology Board Game and its Nocturne Expansion.  It is for two teams of 1, 2, or 3 players (in other words, it's a game specifically for 2, 4, or 6 players).  One team represents the sun cult (orange); the other, the moon cult (black).  The players sit around the table such that the turns will alternate between teams.  With the board set up using bars to divide the outer ring into quarters, and one druid in each of 5 colors on the outer ring, players take turns moving druids and taking actions based upon the movement.  All the druids start out in the building quarter, where the various enormous stones of the trilithons are available for construction, but must make laps of the outer ring in order to collect the energy to build the magnificent Stonehenge.<br/><br/>You may move a druid from a quadrant to the building quarter, spending one card of its color for each quadrant it moves, and one card of its color for each existing stone in his color's trilithon (black cards are wild).  This builds a piece of that trilithon, and scores your team a point.  You may overpay in order to get extra points.<br/>Alternatively, if you move a druid from one quadrant to the next, you draw two cards, keeping one in your hand, and putting the other face-up in front of you.<br/><br/>If you build on a trilithon, you automatically use any appropriate cards your team has face-up on the table.  This also discards any cards of the trilithon's color the opposing team has on the table.  Additionally, each team has a secret trilithon bonus card:  Once that trilithon is complete, that team gets an extra two points.<br/><br/>Sun &amp; Moon is an official game for Stonehenge: An Anthology Board Game and the Nocturne Expansion.<br/><br/>",

        "description": "Big Bad Wolf vs. Cinderella is the fourth title (unpublished) in the Scary Tales series of two-player games pitting common fairy tale characters against each other. Here's more about the characters in this game from the publisher:<br/><br/>&quot;He'll huff and puff 'till he gets his way...and if that doesn't work, maybe his great big teeth will! The Big Bad Wolf has even convinced those boarish Little Pigs to join his malevolent side. She's and over-worked, over-stressed girl on the brink who's had it up to here, plus Cinderella has her Fairy Godmother looking over her shoulder. They're both crazy for power, but which has the strongest will and resources to rule the Land?&quot;<br/><br/>The setting for Scary Tales is a kingdom in which a battle awaits as the king has died, leaving no heir. While the enchanted forest is feared and the castle is covered in dark clouds, corruption has affected the town and only those with the utmost abilities in Strength, Wisdom, Magic and Luck will be able to collect enough relics from the stories of long ago to prove themselves worthy of being the new leader. The challengers are sharp, indomitable, and devious - and with each match-up, it is uncertain who will win the crown.<br/><br/>Each character comes with its own unique ability which may be used once per game and a color coded set of dice. A set of power cards and fortune cards, a fairy card and a die associated with said fairy, comprise the contents of the game. To win, a player needs to obtain seven points worth of relics, and hold on to them until the beginning of their next turn.<br/><br/>",

The cards are now put into a special stand so the person names can't be seen; then the narrator reads out the quotes and everyone tries to guess which of them was said by the person that was announced.<br/>The guessing is done by allocating five chips. Each correctly put chip counts 4 points, fooling someone counts one. Repeat this until all three of the narrator's cards have been used. Then the remaining cards are discarded and everyone draws new ones. This is repeated until everyone has been the narrator once. The player with most points is the winner.<br/><br/>(User summary by HilkMAN)<br/><br/>",

They were Captain Blackbeard and the Red Corsair. <br/>They salvaged treasures, attacked merchant ships and embarked on many an adventure. Over the years, the par assembled loyal crews and had magic pirate spells which they used to spread terror and fear throughout the civilised world. They were as thick as thieves. As for who was the strongest of the two, no one knew. To decide those once and for all, each pirate kidnapped the beloved lady of the other.<br/>In this exciting duel between two legendary figures, the players take on the roles of Captain Blackbeard and the Red Corsair and each attempt to free their ladies from the clutches of their brother.<br/>The table where the cards are laid represents the sea and its islands. The hand of each player represents their pirate ship, while the cards symbolise the crew or the pirate spells. Which pirate brother will be the first to free his lady from the grasp of his brother?<br/><br/>Object of the game:<br/>The object of the game is to free your pirate lady from the clutches of your opponent pirate.<br/>The first player whose lady (Lady in Red for the Red Corsair, Lady in Black for Captain Blackbeard) appears on the opponent's discard pile is the winner.<br/>Cards land on the discard pile either by defeating them while fighting on an isle or due to a penalty when the opponent pirates controle one or more of the 4 islands. Care has to be taken on which island your followers should be send as even the strongest pirate has its weaknesses. Furthermore, every island has its own penalties (e.g. discard cards from your hand / discard pile or pirates already on islands) which should be considered.<br/><br/>",

With UQ Soccer, I aim to provide you with an extremely quick and accurate method of resolving the final score between two soccer teams. With UQ Soccer you can play out an entire season for a team or a league in rapid fashion. UQ Soccer makes a perfect stand-alone game for season replays. It also functions very well as a complimentary game by resolving the games that don&rsquo;t particularly interest you in a detailed shot-by-shot game, while you use the detailed game to play out the games that do interest you. <br/>Unlike most quick play games, which only provide a team score, UQ Soccer does offer an optional individual scoring module to allow you to track league leaders in goals and assists in leagues that track the stat. There is also an individual goal keeper option for some seasons which will allow you to track goal keeper Wins and Losses as well as GAA.<br/><br/>",

These Lords and Ladies will score points by being the first to reach castles that contain Leprechauns before their close competitors.

By carefully choosing from the available actions, players will draw road tiles and attempt to explore castles without getting caught by an Evil Leprechaun. Players will use their special abilities and plan their turns to locate the most shamrocks. These brave souls may escape the clutches of the Evil Leprechaun but not even the luck of the Irish can save them from a Banshee!<br/><br/>The game system allows players to choose from the available six actions, but players may not take more than four. The available actions are: place a road, travel to a castle, exchange one road, destroy one road, draw an Exploration card, or spend a pot of gold.<br/><br/>",

Play the role of an alchemist bartering over ingredients as you try to concoct the strongest potion.<br/><br/>3 Potions are placed on the table, common goal cards for all players. Each turn ingredients are flipped, simply point to indicate which you want to draft. If there are no disputes, you get the card, if there are disputes you must barter over it.<br/><br/>Bartering combines the cost on the card (small, large, near or far) with any descriptive word the current shopkeeper chooses (eg. &quot;hairy&quot;). All players involved call out objects back and forth, each with 5 seconds to visually locate an item in the room that matches the criteria, last one standing wins the disputed card.<br/><br/>Complete the game by linking up your ingredients in an unbroken chain, following all tubes that connect left and right across the cards. Choose one of the three potions, then score points for matching colours, matching shapes and the best alchemical process.<br/><br/>",

No army. No civilization. The United States have collapsed. And now, thirty years after the war started, new powers finally try to take control over the ruined country, try to establish a new order, try to control others and create a new country, a new State: the 51st State.<br/><br/>In standard 51st State there are 110 cards and many tokens. In this free demo version, there are only 40 cards. The game is playable for two players and presents the mechanics of the full version.<br/><br/>In this version players control one of the two powers (New York or Mutants Union) and try to build their very own new country. Players put new locations into the game, they hire leaders, and send people to work in buildings to gain resources and new skills.<br/><br/>Every card can be put into play in three different ways. You can invade a location to gain many resources once, or you can sign a contract with this location to gain one resource every turn, or you can attach the location to your State so you can use its skill. One card, three possibilities. Lots of decisions and choices that matter.<br/><br/>Talia Demo 51. Stanu debuted in issue 25 of the Polish boardgame magazine Świat Gier Planszowych.<br/><br/>",

        "description": "Autumn Leaves is a type of Solitaire: a single player card game. It is easy to learn and very satisfying to play. Take one deck, shuffle, then deal out 22 cards[.]<br/><br/>The aim of the game is to sort out the four suits and get them each into order. There are only six rules that you need to know [...]:<br/><br/>Rule 1:    You can move any card from the top of one pile onto the top of another pile if the suits match and the card being moved is of a lower number (Aces are low).<br/><br/>Rule 2:    When there are no more face-up cards on a pile, turn the topmost face-down card face-up.<br/><br/>Rule 3:    Any card can be placed in an empty pile.<br/><br/>Rule 4:    A descending run of cards in the same suit can be moved as a block.<br/><br/>Rule 5:    At any time you may deal out the next 6 of the left-over cards:<br/>one onto each pile.<br/><br/>Rule 6:    The game is won if each of the four suits is gathered together into a run from King down to Ace. If such a position cannot be reached, then the game is lost.<br/><br/>&quot;Finally, you may wonder why the game is called Autumn Leaves. It is because of the way that the cards flutter back and forth between the piles during play. For me, this adds a sense of peace to the game. I find it strategically and tactically interesting, and yet at the same time I find it rather peaceful and meditative. I hope you do too.&quot;<br/><br/>",

In addition to the usual Chess pieces and two more pawns, each player also has one centurion, starting in the fourth column, and one decurion, starting in the seventh. The centurion jumps to any square two squares distant, either in a straight line or changing direction like a knight. The decurion moves a single square in any diagonal direction, like the fers of Shatranj.<br/><br/>The options and restrictions regarding promotion, castling and en passant are slightly different from regular Chess and/or slightly ambiguous. For instance, pawns are promoted when reaching the last row and always promote to queens.<br/><br/>",

You need only a standard 54-card deck of playing cards to play.<br/><br/>You play the role of the Usurper, a cunning and skillful silver-tongued devil attempting to wrest control from the four kings of the countryside. You do this by climbing the social ladder in each of the four kingdoms, but beware... too many missteps and your machinations will become all too evident, and then it's off with your head!<br/><br/>Playing a game of Kinga involves taking turns purchasing cards from the center tableaux (sort of a reverse-tableau building mechanic), in order to reveal the kings at the bottom of the stacks, or exiling cards from your hand. The game is won if you reveal all four kings -- however, if you are unable to purchase or exile a card on your turn, you must turn one of the kings sideways, raising suspicion of your plan. If all four kings are turned sideways and you need to raise suspicion again, the kings have caught on to your game, and have ordered your execution!<br/><br/>Kinga contains a novel chaining mechanic for purchasing cards -- You first play a 'base' card that determines your value, then any number of other cards from your hand that match either the value or the suit of the previously played card. Each card beyond the first adds 1 to the total value of your currency, and the suits used determine the cards you may purchase. Playing 3 of a kind in a chain lets you draw 1 additional card immediately, and playing all four suits in a chain allows you to draw 2 additional cards immediately.<br/><br/>",

M'buddy SeaBass calls me &ldquo;Song-Froggy&rdquo;, and so can you's all, if'n ya like. I'm wit ya today to do some splainin' on dis here game ya got yer eyeballs on. Now, you're gonna need some scratch paper and a crayon to keep score, just so's ya know. The whole durn point of the game is to get you the most points, and the simplest of folks ought to be able earn at least some, jes' needs a little learnin' is all. What ya gotta do is get you some frogs, what might have the best sound together. Once you done that, you set them up as a band, and now nobody can be a copy-cat and go makin' a band wit dat same sound. It ain't hard, and I'm gunna be here every step to walk ya through it.<br/><br/>Now, ya got two choices every time it's your turn; y'all can pick up a frog and maybe get you some points, or ya can set you up a band and get ye couple more points. The rulebook's the place to get filled in on the par-tic-u-lars, but we ain't in the rulebook right now, is we? (Y'all can go ahead and download dem right now.)<br/><br/>So some of these froggies is 'specially talented, and don't need no backup in they band. You just give'm a washboard or a gutbucket, and they'll be bustin' out a tune in no time. Most frogs, though, they got specific idears on who it is they wanna play with. They'll tell ya, easy enough, just by checkin' out the background on the picture. W'chever frog you choose to lead your band, he's the one you need to mind on that. Check out dem der Action Shots for a peek at what ya got comin' to ya here.<br/><br/>Game's simple enough, folks, but ya can get still get to strategizin' if'n you put yer mind to it. Uncle Cletus might ought like it on account of it being so simple, and ya know you mama gonna like it, cuz all dem cute lil' froggies. I 'spect you'll be pickin' dis'n up fore too long.<br/><br/>",

As her magics grew too much, Kagejima itself cursed her with a shape that evoked her horrid nature. This terrible judgment carried to her offspring who came to bear her form and her name.

When the night has come and everyone else is sleeping, it quietly wakes up. The brutal murderer wanders around the village and preys on honest villagers. Who is the heinous monster?<br/><br/>Rocca Monster is a hidden role/social deduction game for 3-6 players. Each player is dealt three villagers which are placed on the table in front of them. One of the villagers in the game is secretly the monster. All players close their eyes and count to ten, during which time the player with the monster card places a six sided die on a villager of their choice. After the count is finished all players open their eyes and see who was attacked in the night. That player rolls the die, and on a roll of 1-4, the villager on whom the die was placed is killed. On a roll of 5 or 6, the villager survives the attack. After the murder (or attempted murder) the players discuss who they think the monster is, and then use their voting cards to vote for which villager they want to accuse of being the monster. Once a single villager has the majority of votes their card is turned over and it is revealed whether they were the monster or not. If they were the monster then the other players win! If they were not the monster then their card is removed from the game and play continues. Another night attack occurs, followed by another round of discussion and voting. This cycle continues until either the monster successfully kills half the villagers (at which point the monster player wins the game), or until the players successfully identify the monster (at which point the monster player loses and everyone else wins).<br/><br/>",

        "description": "Description from the designer:<br/><br/>The time is October 1962.  The players, representing Kennedy , Khrushchev, and Castro, must try to survive each of the 5 Rounds of the Cuban Missile Crisis while gaining more prestige than your opponents. The game consists of three phases in each of the five Rounds:  Decision Phase, Conflict Phase, and Resolution Phase.  The US and Soviet players will use &ldquo;brinkmanship&rdquo; as they commit resources during the Decision Phase, in which they try to gain an advantage without resulting in a confrontation (referred to in the rules as a Deadlock or Stalemate). During the Conflict Phase, there is a danger that DEFCON 1 might be reached which means imminent nuclear war in which all sides will lose prestige (victory points).  Only if the contestants can work their way successfully through the Conflict phase, without triggering a nuclear war, will they score victory points (prestige) in the Round.<br/><br/>During each Round, each player is required to make one major decision. Then, through the use of tactical cards, the Kennedy and Khrushchev players may make a few further crucial decisions to best implement their chosen strategy for the Round.  ANY of these Decisions have the capacity to trigger the disaster of Nuclear War, which results in the loss of prestige or victory points (not to mention human life).  Be careful!  Who is willing to push the envelope to the brink of disaster in an effort to emerge from the crisis as the world&rsquo;s dominant power? <br/>Decision Phase: <br/><br/>     Each player secretly decides what their &ldquo;bid&rdquo; will be by choosing any number of their cubes.<br/>     When the bids are revealed, the player with the most bid cubes, in this pool, is declared the &ldquo;initial bid winner&quot;, which will increase his chances of ultimate victory in the Round, but also increase the chances of nuclear war if his bid is greatly higher than his opponent.  So each side must push the envelope, but must be restrained as well, so as not to trigger global nuclear war.<br/>     If the bids are the same amount, the Round immediately ends    with neither side gaining any prestige. <br/><br/><br/>Conflict Phase:<br/><br/>     If the players survive the Decision phase they will enter the Conflict phase, where their bids will be resolved to see how much each side earns in prestige (victory points) During this phase Tactic cards can be played in order to better position themselves in determining the outcome of the conflict. It is also during this phase that there is a greater chance of pushing your opponent into a &quot;DEFCON 1&quot; mode which will automatically result in the loss of most of the accumulated victory points from the previous Rounds, and may end the game in full nuclear war, where everyone loses!<br/><br/><br/>The tactics cards represent actual historical events of the period. This micro-game is designed to accurately reflect a brief history of the Cuban Missile Crisis.  The entire game can be played within 15 to 20 minutes.<br/><br/>",

In this action-assignment area-control game, you play as Ash and his allies, and work together to fight off swarms of Deadites commanded by Evil Ash and Evil Shiela. Upgrade your defenses with modern technology from the trunk of Ash's car, and stop the Deadites from overtaking the castle. Each turn, players have a limited time to simultaneously play move, attack, action, and special cards in order to defend the various sections of the castle. After time is up, resolve your chosen cards and play out your programmed actions, rolling dice to attack Deadites. Survive long enough to use the necronomicon to save Shiela, and take down Evil Ash to win the game!<br/><br/>&mdash;description from publisher<br/><br/>",

        "description": "Masada: Epic Last Stand in the Desert is a simple solitaire simulation covering the historic siege of Masada by the Romans in 73 A.D. Its purpose is to show the dynamics and characteristics of the original siege, allowing one to see events unfold in a realistic manner, and thus, understand them better. The game system replicates the siege with the gamer watching events unfold toward resolution as the giant Roman ramp grows ever closer to the fortress plateau...and destiny.<br/><br/>GAME PLAY<br/>Masada is a game on the epic siege of Masada in 73 A.D.  You as the Roman are trying to win as timely as possible. The game system replays the siege. The sequence of play is simple as it has an events phase and an action phase. Both these phases involve rolling dice to see what the Roman accomplished or how game events up to that point impact the turns die rolls.<br/><br/>In the Action Phase, the Roman is hoping that they get to place a ramp. Placing a ramp means the X Legion is getting closer to the plateau where they can assault the redoubt. What can also happen is the result ends up with you rolling on the Defenders Response Table. It's a series of simple calculations - add together the current Supply Index and the sum of 2 dice, comparing it to the current number of ramps placed. If the Defenders total is higher the result is simply no effect. HOWEVER if it is lower - urk...roll another die and compare that to the current Defender's morale Index to get your results.Upon conclusion of the action phase, you end that turn.<br/><br/>It is interesting to note there is no turn limit in the game as historically the Romans were committed to destroying this last resistance.  Upon placing the 16th Ramp, the siege ramp is now completed and combat now happens.<br/><br/>First though you roll to see if the defenders commit mass suicide (the historic result) or if there is a fight to the death. The combat phase can last up to 19 combat rounds. Each Roman roll of 6 eliminates a defender, and Romans roll first. There is no simultaneous combat where each side gets a chance to roll before results are implemented.<br/><br/>The system neatly handles the increasing Roman legionnaire presence on the plateau as each turn the Roman combat value increases by one to a maximum of 19. This means the Roman would roll 19 combat rolls for the final combat round. The surviving defenders roll with each die roll of 6 moves the Combat rounds forward. Each 6 combat rounds the defenders survive results in the Roman Victory Points being lowered by 1.<br/><br/>",

Whenever there is a dispute among wizards, there is - of course - only one way to resolve this: a magical fight to the death.<br/><br/>Team up with friends (or don't) and cast spells at each other until the first offending wizard has perished. Choose from 7 archetypes with each 12 unique and themed spells. Build your initial deck, and pick up new spells to stop enemy strategies or expand on your own, as you play.<br/><br/>Cast magic missiles, boost your allies' spells and suppress those of your opponents. Summon lightning totems, goats or obese wisps. Swamp your foes in dark magic or drain them from their life force. Gain spell power to increase your strength, or cower behind a barrier.<br/><br/>Start the game by choosing a wizard (this gives you a unique ability, and choice from a specific set of cards at the start). Then, pick your spell cards to assemble your deck. Take turns to gain mana, cast spells (paying that mana) and pick up new spells (unrestricted) to add to your deck. The first wizard to remove the last white &quot;life&quot; mana from another wizard's pool (effectively killing them), is the winner!<br/><br/>",

        "description": "A few months [before June 2021,] we announced that we would be discontinuing both 1968 &amp; 1987.<br/><br/>These games were designed when I first started the company and frankly, I was in a rush to put out a catalog. Unfortunately I don't think either of these games are up to the quality I want to maintain with CSL so both will no longer be available on our catalog.<br/><br/>If you purchased 1968 and/or 1987, I will provide you with a 20$ discount toward your next purchase.<br/><br/>Finally, I apologize that these games ended up being broken.<br/><br/>&mdash;description from the designer<br/><br/>1987 is the second Procedural Combat Series game covering a hypothetical low-intensity WW3 based on the original objectives of the 1914 invasion of East Prussia, on the 70th anniversary of the Soviet Union. The order of battle for both sides is drawn from records from the 80s and the tactical situation is nuanced given the absence of major NATO ground forces such as the US, France, England etc. 1987 uses the same rules as 1950 with several changes in both scale and mechanics to reflect the tactical situation.<br/><br/>1987 includes rules for tactical nuclear strikes, refugees, political objectives airmobile units and more. Admittedly, there is little historical basis for this tactical situation given Kaliningrad came under Soviet control after WW2 and the major players in NATO were ready at moments to notice to cooperate as they were during the Balkan wars of the 90s. This situation is only possible if we assume that the major member nations of NATO have isolated themselves and are reluctant to commit.<br/><br/>Note that this is a completely fictional account that is meant to bear no relation to history other than the forces included in the Order of Battle. It assumes that Hitler was successfully assassinated in 1943 allowing Admiral Canaris of the Abwehr to stage a defensive campaign and negotiate a truce with the western allies. As related in Bodyguard of Lies, Canaris had been working towards a rapprochement with the western allies throughout the war. The assassination of Hitler provided the Wehrmacht to activate Beck&rsquo;s plans to take over the government under Canaris&rsquo; guidance and attempt to enlist the West in a crusade against Bolshevism. While this attempt failed it did result in the immediate removal of any Germans who were in the Nazi Party. Canaris, Beck et al were violent anti-Nazis. Not that they were nice guys but they weren&rsquo;t racist, paranoid criminals.<br/>While England and the United States were happy to end the war on a status quo ante basis and turn their attention to crushing the Japanese, they were less willing to attempt to force such a result on the Germans on the Eastern Front. Stalin, facing the likelihood of the full weight of the German war machine (with the SS units rationalized, raising the quality of the entire army), sought and obtained an armistice on the lines established by the Nazi-Soviet pact.<br/>Under pressure from the United States and the Commonwealth, Canaris permitted an independent Poland which slid into the Soviet orbit due to lingering distrust over the German invasion of 1939 (Katyn&rsquo;s grisly harvest would not be discovered in this timeline.) and the return of the eastern provinces absorbed by the Soviets as a result of the Pact.<br/>An early end to the war resulted in a slowing of war technology and the development of nuclear weapons in smaller packages, suitable for tactical (artillery fired) weaponry first. Rocketry remains rudimentary, jets do dominate the skies but the equipment remained 15-20 years behind what developed in our 1987. As a result while there is a possibility of true strategic level nuclear war, the delivery of such weapons is by large jet bombers and not by ICBMs.<br/>The years leading up to 1987 had been bleak for the west. NATO had been developed as a potential counterbalance to an eastern European defensive alliance with the Soviets resulting from the fear of economic vassalage to the western powers. With the Soviets relatively impoverished due to World War II and the despair of having fought so hard with only an armistice to end things. The lack of a significant threat from the Soviet/Eastern European bloc caused the NATO powers to reconsider their commitment to the alliance, with many seeking to make their joint security pledges contingent on their own interests. This came to a head in early 1987 as Article 5 pledges were made voluntary and many parties to the alliance indicated that their choice to respond would be made on a case by case basis. The active components of NATO who would clearly respond to the call of the victim or aggression were reduced to Germany, the Netherlands, Belgium, aspects of US airpower and Canada.<br/>Meanwhile in the Soviet Union significant unrest grew as frustration over a permanent state of war with Germany caused continued economic sanctions (remember, no peace was signed, merely an armistice). Army morale sagged, citizens demonstrated and it seemed that the Soviet Union would come undone from internal centripetal forces. Something had to be done and the Politburo grabbed at the straw that always seemed to bring Russia together &ndash; a war. After all, they were already at war and the unwillingness of the Germans to end it was strangling the Soviet Union. The Poles would help as they wanted revenge.<br/>The goal was simple. Cause NATO a loss. Show that the Eastern bloc retained its vitality while NATO was losing its. No one wanted a full-fledged war, just enough of a spat to move from armistice to peace&hellip;<br/><br/>WEIGHT: 7/10<br/>SOLITAIRE: 9/10<br/>PLAYERS: 1-2<br/><br/>&mdash;description from the publisher<br/><br/>",

        "description": "The deadliest martial arts experts have gathered in a secret arena to engage the ultimate stealth assassin showdown. As each is evenly matched in strength, skill, and speed, only cunning and courage will tell who will be the last one standing.<br/><br/>Ninjas!! The Stealth Assassin Showdown is a battle royale board game for 2 to 4 players, who use deduction to find and strike moving opponents while trying to evade attacks themselves.<br/><br/>The game is played on a 10-by-10 grid, and involves playable Move and Attack cards, as well as Ninja Star and Footprint tokens. Each player begins with the same hand of 12 cards--the 12 Styles of Ninja, which depict and describe the strategies in the ninja's toolbox, and which can be used to help find, hit, or dodge opponents. Turns alternate between Moves and Attacks, in which all players plan secretly, and then reveal and resolve simultaneously. Players record their own turns and track evidence of their opponents' movements in writing on a Notepad.<br/><br/>Although the in-game goals remain the same for every game of Ninjas!!, players can change the end-game conditions to allow for different game times and styles of gameplay. The standard game involved 3 wounds and player elimination, other options include Sudden Death matches as well as point-based games in which players count the number of successful attacks against the number of times they were wounded. Each game of Ninjas!! can also be played on a differently laid out board and with different starting positions.<br/><br/>-description from publisher<br/><br/>",

Go out there and make your fortune, but beware, you&rsquo;re not the only one out there seeking their fortune. Pirates are scouring the waters looking to claim what you&rsquo;ve found, sea creatures lurk in the deep ready to devour you, and your fellow privateers could either help you, or steal your booty for their own purpose. These are lawless and dangerous waters, and you must be prepared for anything. Will you find the treasure you seek, or will you meet your doom? Adventure awaits!<br/><br/>Each player takes a turn to explore into new tiles, sail through existing tiles, or remain on their current tile and try to get as much treasure as they can. They can find treasure on islands, while diving, after defeating pirates or sea creatures, or even by attacking other players! When players draw a tile while exploring, they place it in any free space adjacent to their ship and move there immediately. There are five special types of tiles that can be drawn: Islands (where you'll find the majority of your treasure), Diving Locations (you need a diving bell to access them), Pirates (the scourge of the seven seas), Sea Creatures (mythical beasts wanting to destroy your ship and eat your crew), and Shops (places to upgrade your ship and crew). The first player to get to 100 treasure in their stash wins the game!<br/><br/>Buried Treasure is a world building, open world sandbox game that is built as the players take their turn. Instead of using a standard playing board, players build the game board by drawing tiles when they explore the world. If the tiles are ever used up, players can still sail throughout the map trying to find more treasure on islands, by diving, and attacking pirates/sea creatures/other players. Outfitting your ship and crew allows you to specialize your ship to be better at attacking, exploring, defense, or speed. We've also added in storms which can rip parts off of your ship and throw you and other players in range of the storm off course. You never know what to expect when you play this game!<br/><br/>-description from designer<br/><br/>",

Search for clues and find evidence while you track the spy, but watch out for dangerous explosives!<br/><br/>To Catch a Spy is a 1-2 player game of espionage. To set up, place nine location cards in a 3x3 grid, then place discovery cards under each location. Place three file cards near the locations, then place case cards under each file. Place decks for arrow cards and additional discovery cards nearby, along with two agent tool cards. The spy and agent cards start in different locations.<br/><br/>In the solo game, you are the agent and go first, moving to an adjacent location and revealing a discovery card, which could be an item, clue, or bomb; item and clue cards go in hand, while bombs force you to discard. You can use a location's special ability and clues to reveal case cards under files. You might be able to place a tracking bug on the spy.<br/><br/>For the spy's turn, the arrow cards move the spy to an adjacent location, where a new discovery card is placed at random. If the spy moves to your location, discard a card. If you can't discard a card or discover you've discarded an item matching a case card, you lose immediately.<br/><br/>When the discovery deck is empty, the spy attempts to escape. You must have placed a tracking bug on the spy, have the three item cards in hand matching the case cards, and make it to the spy's current location before the spy escapes.<br/><br/>In the two-player game, one player is the spy while the other is the agent. At the start of a round, each player chooses and reveals an arrow card, then the agent takes their turn, followed by the spy. Gameplay takes place as described above, with the spy needing to place all cards in the discovery deck before trying to escape, while the agent needs to collect the three items matching the case, bug the spy, then reach the spy's location.<br/><br/>Awards:<br/><br/>From the 2020 54-Card Game Design Contest.<br/>-Best Solo Game: 1st place!<br/>-Best Overall Game: 2nd place!<br/>-Best 2 Player Game: 2nd place!<br/>-Best Graphic Design: 3rd place!<br/><br/>",

The Skinchanger Unit Attachment can be placed in any unit, ignoring usual Unit Attachment rules (so they can join a unit with another attachment already in it). When being added, the player can also add their animal unit to the table. When the Skinchanger&rsquo;s unit activates, the accompanying animal can activate immediately afterward, creating perfect &ldquo;one-two punch&rdquo; combinations. Just be sure that the two are never further than Long Range from one-another, or the Skinchanger is killed. Either situation will cause the animal to also be destroyed.<br/><br/>",

The hand of each player is always held with the backs facing the opposite player. The cards are played next to others on the table showing their back sides and triggering some effects.

They must come up with a convincing explanation as to how or why they know the correct answer...even if they don&rsquo;t.<br/><br/>After everyone pleads their case, the Judge grabs the two black cards and gives the Brilliant card to the person they think got the question right and the BS card to the person they think got it wrong.<br/><br/>The player that receives the Brilliant card automatically earns 2 points and the player who receives the BS card earns 0 points.<br/><br/>The Judge announces the correct answer (highlighted in bold) before asking the other players to reveal their cards. The players who did NOT receive a Brilliant or BS card go first, followed by the player who received the BS card. The person who received the Brilliant card reveals their answer last. Each player that gets the question right earns 1 point.<br/><br/>The Judge receives 1 point for each correct Brilliant prediction and 1 point for each correct BS prediction. But beware. For each wrong prediction, the Judge loses 1 point.<br/><br/>Play continues until each person has had the chance to be the Judge the same number of times. The player with the most points at the end of the game wins. (Suggested length of game play is 1 hour.)<br/><br/>",

Players compete to build complex and simple compounds from individual atoms.  Points are scored upon completing each molecule.  Players may choose to play to any score they wish - a suggested goal is 92, which is the atomic number of Uranium (the heaviest naturally occurring element).  If the player would like a longer game then an alternate goal could be the atomic number of the heaviest element currently discovered.  Players scores are kept on the periodic table of element.  Play as Carbon(Solid), Oxygen(liquid), Helium(Gas), or Nitrogen(Unknown).<br/><br/>The points scored as players finish building compounds come in two varieties: simple and complex.  Simple compounds are common compounds which are made up of relatively few atoms.  Complex compound are designated as such; either because they consist of more atoms and bonds, or because they are less well known. Complex compounds have the added difficulty of requiring the recipe card to complete.  This also earns the player bonus points.<br/><br/>Once a compound is started it can be completed by any player which means a compound you start out to be Methane (a simple compound) may be turned into Acetic Acid (a complex compound) requiring a recipe.<br/><br/>Cards include single, double and triple bonds, elements, and recipes for compounds.  Play is fast paced and allows the players to learn about organic chemistry while they play this fun interactive game.<br/><br/>",

        "description": "What can be easier than drawing a ladder or a Christmas tree? A few lines on a piece of paper will be enough. But what if another person will come and turn your sketch into something completely different? And right in front of your eyes, the ladder turns into tracks with a train at full speed, and the Christmas tree becomes a toothy monster...<br/><br/>Each round in Sherlock &amp; Picasso, there is a pairing of the artist and the rascal. The first has 40 seconds to sketch up to eight objects, and the second then spoils each picture, so other players can't guess the initial object. If they do, they and the artist gain victory points; if they don't, the rascal has managed to fool them and gets points for that!<br/><br/>&mdash;description from the publisher<br/><br/>",

        "description": "Foutrak is a speedy pattern-recognition game from Cocktail Games in which players duel to claim cards.<br/><br/>On a turn, the active player challenges one of the other players. They then turn over the top card of the deck. Each card has 1-4 numbered illustrations on it, and each illustration is either yellow, blue or green. If an illustration is yellow, the players must make an action appropriate for the image; if blue, the player must make an appropriate sound; and if green (i.e., blue + yellow), the player must make both sound and action.<br/><br/>Whichever player first makes the appropriate combination of sounds and actions in the right order claims the card. (The other players can serve as judge to determine the winner.) Whoever claims the most cards wins the game.<br/><br/>&bull; Texte de Cocktail games pour pr&eacute;senter le jeu.<br/><br/>&quot;Alors, quand ma carte a un fond jaune, je dois faire des gestes&hellip; et quand j&rsquo;ai une carte bleue, je paye l&rsquo;addition, c&rsquo;est &ccedil;a ?&quot;. Pas de panique, reprenons au d&eacute;but ! Foutrak est un jeu d&rsquo;observation et de rapidit&eacute; compl&egrave;tement farfelu qui vous propose de faire des bruitages et des mimes. &Agrave; chaque tour a lieu un duel entre 2 joueurs. Le joueur actif choisit un adversaire puis retourne une carte. Il s&rsquo;agit alors de r&eacute;aliser ce qui est indiqu&eacute; sur les illustrations de la carte avant son camarade. C&rsquo;est l&agrave; que les choses se compliquent. Toute illustration sur fond jaune invite les joueurs &agrave; mimer ce qui y est repr&eacute;sent&eacute; (un lapin, un accord&eacute;on, etc.). Si un dessin sur fond bleu appara&icirc;t, vous devrez faire le bruit correspondant (miauler si c&rsquo;est un chat, par exemple). Enfin, le fond vert invite &agrave; mimer et bruiter l&rsquo;image (ah, le singe&hellip;). Les cartes de jeu contiennent de une &agrave; quatre illustrations num&eacute;rot&eacute;es. Les joueurs sont ainsi inform&eacute;s de l&rsquo;ordre dans lequel ils doivent effectuer les actions de chaque carte.

If the Hero player wants to include their KS Elf Lord tiles, they take these 4 tiles and shuffle them, placing them face down next to their draw deck.<br/><br/>Game Play: When the Hero player is playing one of their Wild cards, they may discard the Wild card rather than using the ability and draw one of the face down Elf Lord Wild tiles playing it instead. This is an optional action enabling the player to play the original Wild card or choose to play the Elf Lord. They make this decision prior to seeing the Elf Lord card.<br/><br/>Optional Rule: If the Dark Lord player is more experienced and wished to handicap themselves, they may allow the Hero player to have the KS ELf Lord Wild tiles face up and choose which one to play each time rather than the cards being random.<br/><br/>The Aloof ELf Lord: After the Battlefield that the Elf Lord Tile was played on, the Tile is returned to the box and not shuffled back into the other tiles. Therefore, the Elf Lord will only only appear on the Battlefields 4 times, being discarded to the box when the respective battlefields are resolved.<br/><br/>",

They built cities and moved mountains at his command, for fear of his angry gas!<br/><br/>But man is mortal, and even the life of Suleiman must come to its end.

Each player starts with a mystery face-down artifact in their collection as well as a hand of artifact cards and two artifact cards in their window as products that can be acquired. A market card for each of the six types of artifacts is laid out, with the order of these cards determining their value at the end of the game.<br/><br/>On a turn, you refill your hand and refill your window, then you pick a product that someone has displayed in their window. The owner of that product has two choices:<br/><br/><br/>    Let you take that product into your permanent collection, while they use the power on that card, or<br/>    Take the card into their own collection, while you then get to use that card's power.<br/><br/><br/>Each type of artifact has a different power, such as increasing your hand size, changing the order of cards on the market, and locking a card's value on the market.<br/><br/>Once you have five cards in your collection, you receive one of the completion chips and are now out of the game. Once all players have completed their collections, you reveal fate cards to see which items are worthless, then sum the value of your collection based on the antiques' value on the market.<br/><br/>",

        "description": "The game Teko was first released in 1945. Teko is played on a 4x4 grid. The name was changed to Teeko (and the board grid changed to 5x5) for the 1952 release by John Scarne Games.<br/><br/>Each player has four pieces. Players start by alternately placing pieces on a 5x5 grid, then alternate moves (moving one piece each turn to an adjacent point on the grid). Object is to get four pieces in a row, or to form a square with your four pieces.<br/><br/>Teko Junior rules do not allow diagonal moves. A player can win with the same patterns, but can also win by blocking his opponent's 4 pieces from moving (on a 4x4 grid).<br/><br/>In 1998 Guy Steele solved standard Teeko, as well as all variants proposed by the original inventor. The solution was brute force. Standard Teeko (only win with 4 in a row or a 2x2 square) is a draw with perfect play. Advanced Teeko (win with 4 in a row or a square of any size) is a win for the first player.<br/><br/>Reimplementations or successors:<br/><br/>A fully independently developed successor of the game with similar material and quite close winning conditions is Mondrago. Anyway instead of starting from a clean board Mondrago uses a fixed setup of the player's pawns. Besides winning with squares being parallel to board edges Mondrago uses diagonally and obliquely aligned perfect squares as well.<br/><br/>",

Asmodee also released it as part of the PnP series during 2019-2020 COVID-19 Pandemic.<br/><br/>In standard Carcassonne, there are 72 tiles and 40 meeples. In this free demo version, there are 48 tiles (that have to be cut out from a sheet) and no meeples (the players have to use some substitutes). Each player needs only 4 meeples.<br/><br/>Generally, most rules are the same. Players draw and place a tile with a piece of southern French landscape on it. The tile might feature a city, a road, grassland or some combination thereof, and it must be placed adjacent to tiles that have already been played, in such a way that cities are connected to cities, roads to roads, etcetera. Having placed a tile, the player can then decide to place one of his meeples on one of the areas on it: on the city as a knight or on the road as a robber. When that area is complete, that meeple scores points for its owner.<br/><br/>However, there are some exceptions from the basic rules in editions released before 2019:<br/>1) A player cannot place a meeple on the grass as a farmer.<br/>2) The are no cloister tiles.<br/><br/>In the edition released during 2020, 4 cloister tiles are included.<br/><br/>",

Three randomly drawn cards are placed side by side. Arrows on the outer cards will point on two attributes on the center card. The player whose turn it is chooses one of these attributes and asks the other players how they rate himself in regard of this attribute (like: &quot;I am funny&quot; or &quot;I make friends easily&quot;). All players (including the active player) secretly rate how much they think that the chosen attribute is correct. The players have numbered cards from 1 to 3 (4, 5 - depending on the number of players) which they play face-down. All cards are then flipped face-up. The numbers are added up, the sum is looked up in a table which will tell which number will grant its player a point. The more the player's ratings are off, the fewer players (if any) will score points. Then it is the next player's turn.

AlakasSLAM is a micro card game in which you play a sorcerer competing in the most important tennis match of all: the AlakaSLAM!<br/><br/>Players start with an eight-card hand and use up to three cards per turn to aim, hit, and enchant shots or get extra movement. Careful hand management is key as the cards you use to aim also determine if your ball snags in the net, flies out of bounds, or sets your opponent scrambling. Conserve cards to cautiously build up your mobility, or strike aggressively with powerful enchantments. A well-made shot could spell success &mdash; but miscalculate and forfeit the point!<br/><br/>The two-player variant focuses on strategic decisions while the four-player variant is more of a short party game of trusting your partner.<br/><br/>",

Following the rules, each player creates a fictional character &ndash; a person accused (justly or not) of a crime against the empire and on the run with her lover. The game starts when the protagonists find themselves passing through Bertinoro, a settlement on the hills of Romagna by the Via Aemilia and close to the Ravenna port.<br/><br/>Unfortunately for them, in that torrid summer, Bacchus and his followers came down to this village surrounded by vineyards. Attracted by the excesses brought forth by intoxication, other gods manifest themselves; cruel Pluto, severe Minerva and the sensuous Venus will play with the destiny of mortals with all the thoughtlessness only gods can have. The player's objective is to reunite with her beloved and run away. Each player in turn draws a hand of cards and, based on the results of the draw, describes a scene from the story for her protagonists. Elements of the scene vary according to which god was more present in the draw. For instance, a scene dominated by Pluto will feature a violent crime in which the protagonist ends up somehow involved. Benevolent Venus reunites lovers. Bacchus brings thrill and excitement, and so on. There is a clear winning condition &ndash; reuniting with the beloved and running away before your accuser catches you &ndash; but one player reaching it doesn't prevent other players from doing the same; multiple winners are possible.<br/><br/>In the chaos of the bacchanal, will the fugitives be able to reunite with their beloved and get to safety?

        "description": "&quot;The Pirate Deck&quot; is a card game for 2-4 players. Players take turns strategically using pirate cards to board a ship and steal treasure by matching card icons.<br/><br/>Games take only 10-25 minutes to play. The games are quick and lead you to want to play a second round. While this is a light game, there is strategy involved in order to make the best use of the cards in your hand and complete as many coin icons as possible.<br/><br/>Gameplay begins with setting up 5 &quot;Starting Cards&quot; in front of the players in the shape of a shared pirate ship, along with a pile of 25 treasure coins. Players start their turn with three cards in their hand, and take turns playing cards to try to match up coin icons on the ship. Pirate cards can be added to the ship in specific locations, replace other pirates, or be removed from the ship entirely (with adjacent cards being pushed together to close the gap). A variety of other cards add another layer of interest and player interaction to the game. For each silver coin icon matched on the ship, one actual coin is taken from the treasure pile. Two coins are taken for matching a gold coin icon. When the pile runs out, the player with the most treasure coins wins.<br/><br/>",

Figure out the answer in Snowblind, a quasi-strategic Icehouse game for 4 players.<br/><br/>Object: To maximize your score and minimize your opponents&rsquo; scores by putting pieces in taller and smaller stacks, respectively.<br/><br/>You Need:<br/><br/>* Four Icehouse stashes of different colors.<br/>    * An opaque bag (or other opaque container).<br/>    * A 4&times;3 grid. A Volcano board or chess board with some squares blocked off works just fine.<br/>    * Some paper and a pencil for tallying scores at the end of the game.<br/><br/>On your turn, take a piece out of the bag and put it on the board. When you put a piece on the board, it must point upward. Pieces are played by these rules:<br/><br/>* Any piece may be placed in a vacant space.<br/>    * A smaller piece may be 'engulfed' by a larger piece if the smaller piece is resting directly on the board.<br/>    * A piece of smaller or equal size may be placed on another piece of equal or greater size.<br/><br/>Once you have placed a piece, play passes to the left. The game ends when all pieces have been played. After this, all the stacks are scored. Stacks have a value equal to the point value of the pieces in the stack, multiplied by the number of pieces in the stack. Points are tallied separately by color. A piece that is 'engulfed' is scored by the color that&rsquo;s engulfing it, not by the 'owner' of the engulfed piece. Engulfed pieces do not count for being in a stack.<br/><br/>The player with the highest total at the end of the game wins.<br/><br/>Several variants to the rules are also available on the website.<br/><br/>Home Page: <a target='_blank' href=\"http://www.invisible-city.com/play/174/snowblind\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer noopener\">http://www.invisible-city.com/play/174/snowblind</a><br/><br/>",

So, are you ready to adopt these adorable creatures...with math?<br/><br/>The gameplay is simple. You, as a cat lover, want to adopt a cat by giving them a lure card that has a number on it. When the lure card(s) in play can be calculated equal to the number on the cat card, you deserve to adopt that adorable cat. The game ends when no lure card or no cat card can be acquired. The player who has collected the most cats wins.<br/><br/>There's also a speed mode in which your speed of counting is tested among your peers...but be careful, you must maintain your manner if you don't want those adorable cats run off from you.<br/><br/>",

The forest is also full of monsters!<br/><br/>In The Forest Dragon you will create a fantasy world from cards, and then explore it. In a round of the game players lay out rows of cards that make up the world they are going to explore. They take it in turns to reveal one card at a time, and follow instructions on the card: Resources are collected in your backpack. Adventure items also go in the backpack, but help with the adventure. Monsters will end your expedition, sometimes taking items you've collected! You can chose to head home at any time and bank your finds. Or keep going, risking it all! Pushing your luck and knowing when to stop are key.<br/><br/>With amazing art from Rory and his little brother Ben, and with just a little help from their dad, games-industry veteran Jon Hodgson, The Forest Dragon is a fast and exciting game for the whole family!<br/><br/>",

In timed rounds, each player takes 45 seconds drawing one card at a time acting out a cause of death, trying to get their team to guess what is written on the card. No words allowed, and teams alternate until each team member has acted one or two rounds. At the end of two rounds whoever has the most cards guessed correctly wins!<br/><br/>Each copy of Death Charades comes with the game box, 205 death cards, 10 gameplay cards and 4 blanks to write your own deaths.<br/><br/>-description from publisher<br/><br/>",

Each player manages the military, political and economic aspects of their state, competing to create the greatest empire in the world.  Disasters such as rebellion, invasion or civil war may occur at any time -- players must seek an optimal balance between growth and stability to succeed. Although military affairs play an important part in Ancient Empires, the game is designed so that this aspect does not dominate game play.  Movement and combat are abstracted to a strategic level, and players will find that timing is just as important as brute strength to avoid counterproductive warfare.  Players must pay equal attention to trade, diplomacy and internal affairs in order to remain strong enough to discourage aggression. Victory Points are awarded for the size of an empire, and the level of development it achieves relative to its peers.  Destroyed players retain their Victory Points and may re-enter the game to carve out a new empire.<br/><br/>",

        "description": "Winchester is a race game where the players score points by getting their pawns around a rectangular track the fastest. Each player gets 3 to 5 pawns (based on the number of players) which are placed on a 4 by 4 starting grid.  The track is four squares wide. During the setup, the players randomly cover some of these squares with wooden blocks to provide obstacles that prevent movement. The location of the blocks is determined by several die rolls.  This random setup provides for a different track each race.<br/><br/>Movement of the players' pawns is controlled by a special six sided chess die. The die contains the six basic chess pieces: King, Queen, Rook, Bishop, Knight and Pawn. Each turn a player will roll the chess die to determine everyone's move for that turn.  Once all players have moved, the next player on the left rolls the die for the next round. When moving, the player must move one of his pieces based on the indicated chess piece.  Like chess, the player may not move off the edge of the board or over one of the obstacles, except for the knight move.  If the player captures one of the piece of another player, the two pieces exchange positions.<br/><br/>The first piece to cross the finish line scores 15 points with each successive piece scoring one less (14, 13, 12, etc).  There are small bonuses for certain finishing conditions (first to have all pieces finish, three positions in a row, etc).<br/><br/>The game comes with a rolled up, laminated board, 25 pawns, 24 wooden blocks for obstacles, one normal die and one chess die.<br/><br/>",

The other faces give money to other players, levy taxes, or let you invest your money in your store (hiding it from the government). The more taxes everyone pays, the more dice everyone gets to roll as the city is rebuilt. The reroll cubes work on yourself as well as other players rolls.<br/><br/>Optional Dexterity rules: In the center of the table, a lucky cat plushie beckons. If any player rolls two cat or two crown symbols, be the first to hit the plushie and you get the broken cat tiles or avoid the heavy tax! Move Fast!<br/><br/>Advanced variable power tiles allow you to manipulate the dice, your cash, and your luck. Take-that advanced powers are entirely optional to include or not. Variable starting conditions allow experienced players to draft different starting resources.<br/><br/>Lucky Cat was designed for big or small groups of diverse friends.

        "description": "A very curious game from Switzerland, designed by &quot;PM&quot; from its novel 'Tripura Transfer' published in Switzerland and Germany. A 2 player tile placement game in which one player represents the Coloured world of the Demons, whilst the other represents the Grey world of Concrete! The tiles have a grey side showing workers, police (baton raised!), managers, houses, schools, factories, offices and computers. The other colourful side shows creatures like penguins, spiders, octopii, cats, mice and more fantastic creatures like chimera, sphinx, dragon, and concepts like death, explosion, ruin, nature, puppet-theater, dice, maze, TV and free-public-radio! The Colour tiles have values, multipliers and different abilities, such as removing tiles, affecting distant tiles and so on. These are not obvious, so constantly refering to the rules will slow the game.<br/>Grey has a starting fund and must buy and place or move tiles to generate income. Colour must turn Grey tiles over to disrupt the boring real world and prevent Grey from finishing with a profit. The game can be made harder for Colour by giving Grey more starting money. A totally weird and original game, very nice production, with lovely tiles painted in a naive style. Rules in German, French and English.<br/><br/>",

Players take on the role of breeders assembling a stable of fantastical creatures and mechanical monstrosities, and entering them into illegal pit fights against each other - while also betting on the outcome of these bouts.<br/><br/>In Underleague, each player has a 30 card creature deck. During the game, 3 of these cards will be in play as that player's current stable. Each creature has a unique effect, and a value which contributes to a player's over-all victory points. Each round, players use these creatures to challenge their opponents', while betting on which creatures will win and lose fights. Winning fights results in additional victory points.<br/><br/>There is an additional shared 250 card strategy deck, from which players will draw scheme cards and equipment cards, which can be used to impact the results of fights and the flow of the game. The more correct bets a player makes during a round, the more strategy cards they will be able to draw in the next. The first player to achieve a total of 20 victory points wins the game.<br/><br/>Underleague contains a total of 30 unique creature cards and 40 unique strategy cards. In addition to the basic game mode, it also contains rules for 'constructed' and 'draft' play.<br/><br/>",

        "description": "&quot;Proch i Stal&quot; (Gunpowder and Steel) is a cooperative board game based on events that took place in 1771-1772 in and around a benedictine monastery located near Cracow (Tyniec). A group of confederates (rebelling against Russian influence in Poland) gained control of the monastery and turned it into fortress. Attacked both by Russian armies they managed to hold Tyniec and to organize numerous attacks on nearby areas. Probably the most amazing of those is conquest of Wawel castle (confederates managed to enter it via old sewer tunnel and took its Russian garrison by surprise).<br/><br/>In the game players take on the roles of officers of confederate forces. Their task is to hold the fortress for specified number of turns (based on difficulty level). They need to organize food for soldiers, support the garrison of Wawel castle, try to keep decent morale among the confederates and most of all prevent casualties among their units. If at any point during the game Tyniec will be left without units to defend it the fortress falls and players loose. Cooperation, planing and a bit of luck is what it takes to win the game.<br/><br/>Player's turn consist of two things. First you draw an event card that will have two effects - one it will control the movement of the Russian forces (reinforcements, advance or press attack on Wawel), second will be actual positive or negative event (that often will give a players choice whether to accept consequences like loosing units, food, morale or discard action cards as a group). Next the player will have a chance to act by playing action card - actions include organizing reinforcement for Wawel, bringing food to the fortress, fighting with Russian units etc. After 4 players turns an upkeep phase occurs - food is needed for soldiers, moral is checked and Russians forces strom the Tyniec.<br/><br/>",

All Characters have different sets of statistics and powers - find your own unique combination and lay waste to your opponent!<br/><br/>TactDecks is a two-player competitive game where the objective is to eliminate your opponent through a tactical combination of spells, troop movement, and light board manipulation. All components of the game - board, troops, terrain, mechanics - are represented by pocket-sized cards, making TactDecks highly portable and affordable.<br/><br/>Like many traditional miniature based wargames, TactDecks troops are selected based on a total army point value agreed upon prior to the start of the game. In addition to selecting troops, terrain is also chosen from this common point pool. Initial troop selection and terrain placement is considered a tactical component of the game, since some troops may not be fielded by both players.<br/><br/>Combat mechanics are based on Near (adjacent) and Far (ranged) attacks, modified by individual troop prowess. Degrees of attack success are determined by an &quot;event deck.&quot;<br/><br/>In addition to physical attacks, TactDecks also features varying spell mechanics, trap placement (with expansion booster cards), and a light melee dueling system incorporating a feature called &quot;Reserves,&quot; which also help determine initiative.<br/><br/>TactDecks is easy to learn and scales in complexity based on whatever additional booster sets the players bring to the table.<br/><br/>A single TactDecks Basic Set may be used as a competitive starter deck or split and used by two players with the included optional rules.<br/><br/>",

Cards are played, with titles straight from pro wrestling moves (Figure Four Leg Lock, Atomic Drops) and quips (Did you see that?!).  The cards have different costs and effects, adjusting the wrestler's fatigue markers as the fighters stun, knock down, and try to pin each other.  Some allow the wrestlers to seize the momentum and attack.  When the players have played all the cards they want, they determine the injuries inflicted onto their wrestlers and refill their hand of cards.  When the deck has ran out of cards, the cards that have been played are reshuffled to form a new deck.<br/><br/>The game ends when a player wins the match by having their opponent's wrestler pinned, knocked out, or disqualified.  The game also ends when the card deck has been reshuffled as many times as the number of players in the game.<br/><br/>",

        "description": "Feds 'n' Heads is a fairly basic roll and move game based on the designer's own famous comic strip, The Fabulous Furry Freak Brothers.  The game bears more than a passing resemblance to Monopoly (collect money for passing go, roll a double to get out of jail or pay $50, etc.) but the board is more sprawling and includes several junctions and special squares. Roll dice and move around the board trying to collect a kilo (35 lids) of grass by landing on specific locations and buying as much as they can afford.  When players pass the Home square, $50 is collected from the banker and grass can be stashed at home, protecting the grass from being taken from you by any means.  Red squares require you to draw a Burns, Busts, Bummers &amp; Rip-Offs card, while green squares require you to draw a Weird Trips card.  Players can also wind up in Jail (roll a double, pay $50 or 5 lid to get out) or at the free clinic (pay $15... Hey, it says FREE clinic!)  The winner is the player who, moving his token the number shown on the dice, manages to score 35 ounces and get back Home with it.<br/><br/>Originally published as a fold-out board in Playboy Magazine.<br/><br/>",

Travel with your associates along the road from Medellin to Miami, avoiding police controls to complete your job as smoothly as possible. For every failed delivery there&rsquo;s someone who&rsquo;ll pay and you&rsquo;d better hope it&rsquo;s not you. In NARCOS each player will have to play his role for everything to go as planned. But be warned, double crossers hide behind every corner an under cover cop could catch you red-handed, or worse, one of your associates might as well decide to cheat you.<br/><br/>Game preparation<br/>Shuffle the character cards and distribute them face down ,one to each player. Each player will check the character he has been given and put the card in front of himself,careful to keep  it face down all the time. Shuffle the Delivery deck and give 5 cards to each player. Put the deck in the middle of the game table in order to allow every player to easily reach it. Leave some free space for the discard pile.<br/>At no time during the match should anyone ever reveal his character identity by any mean, not should anyone give details of the cards he has in his hands or those who have been given or received during the match. However, it is possible for the players to talk during the INTERROGATION phase to try saving their own neck and to avoid being eliminated. <br/>Once every player has his own character and his own hand, you can continue to the next phase of the game.<br/>END OF THE GAME:<br/>The game ends when one of these conditions occurs:<br/>Drug traffickers victory:<br/>The DRUG TRAFFICKERS win if they manage to successfully complete the expected number of deliveries before the end of the turns (based on the numbers of players)<br/>Or<br/>The DRUG TRAFFICKERS win if they eliminate EVERY federal agent<br/>Or<br/>an individual DRUG TRAFFICKER can decide to starts his own business and win the match on his own(VICTORY BY MONOPOLY)<br/>Federal agents victory:<br/>FEDERAL AGENTS win if they manage to prevent the drug traffickers to successfully complete the expected number of deliveries.<br/>Pablo Escobar victory:<br/>PABLO ESCOBAR wins if during any delivery round he manages to obtain FOUR PARLAMENTARIAN cards AFTER haing passed the four cards of that turn to the player on his left side.

But if you&rsquo;re not so lucky, the shooter will fire a stream of cards that you have to add to your hand! And when the shooter is launching cards, it makes a variety of funny sounds that add energy and silliness to the game. UNO Attack Jurassic World adds speed and surprise to the game because you never know when an attack is coming! The goal is still to get rid of all the cards in your hand, and when you&rsquo;re down to one card, don&rsquo;t forget to yell, &ldquo;UNO!&rdquo; Contains 112 cards, Dilophosaurus shooter, and instructions.

Attack!&quot; card - When this card is played, whoever played it gets to call any color and then choose ANY OTHER PLAYER in the game to &ldquo;Attack.&rdquo;  The Dilophosaurus Card Launcher is rotated to face the chosen player, and then &ldquo;attacking&rdquo; player gets to press down on the Dilophosaur&rsquo;s nose twice.  The player being &ldquo;attacked&rdquo; must keep all the cards that come out of the launcher.  The game then continues with the next player in regular rotation (the second player to the left &ndash; or right in Reverse rotation - of the player who played the Wild Attack-Attack card).<br/><br/>The goal is to get rid of all the cards in your hand, and the first player or team to 500 wins.

        "description": "Leiden 1593: ライデン-チューリップ栽培の始まり- (Leiden 1593: The Beginning of Tulip Cultivation) is a speculation game in which players are tulip merchants. They reclaim the garden, raise tulips, and ship them out. With the help of hired artisans, they aim to be the wealthiest merchant.<br/><br/>At the beginning of the game, several cards are laid on the table to form the tulip garden. Each card represents 2x3 squares of garden, which is single-colored or double-colored to represent species of tulip. Each turn, you may place a garden card, build your hut, or upgrade your hut into a house:<br/><br/><br/>    When you place a garden card, you must partially overlay it on existing garden; the overlaid color of tulip becomes rare, so therefore its market value is raised. <br/>    When you build a hut or a house, you discard several cards and place the building on the garden. You may hire an artisan when you have built a house. Each artisan has a special ability.<br/><br/><br/>At the end of the game, for each color, you score victory points equal to the market value of that color multiplied by the number of squares your buildings occupy on that color. Then add some bonus depending on your buildings' location. The highest scorer wins.<br/><br/>Publisher's summary<br/>Leiden1593は、オランダのチューリップ栽培の始まりをテーマにしたゲームです。プレイヤーは商人となり、土地を開墾し、チューリップを栽培して出荷します。様々な能力を持った人の力も借りながら、一番裕福な商人を目指しましょう！<br/><br/>",

Here the important thing is to learn and have fun, because the fight begins by playing.<br/>The dynamics of the game consists of 1,200 questions, included in six categories. Each category is represented by an iconic figure from that field: Simone de Beauvoir (Academy): great theoretical references of yesterday and today; Angela Davis (Street): social movements and activism, also on the Internet; Judith Butler (Bodies): sexuality, health, LGBTQ and transfeminisms; Frida Kahlo (Culture): feminine and feminist contributions to the history of literature, music, fine arts, cinema, comics, etc; Olympe de Gouges (Rights): progress on rights (abortion, divorce, vote ...), institutional policy, conventions and international law; and Valentina Tereshkova (Herstory): Did you know that history is full of women who do things?<br/>Objective: Have fun! And, incidentally, learn something about our own feminist genealogies.<br/>You will have to move around the board answering the questions correctly and collect all the cards of the &quot;Queens of Feminism&quot; protagonists of each of the six categories. To win you must return to the center and answer a question from a category chosen by the rest of the participants.<br/><br/>",

It doesn&rsquo;t matter whether it&rsquo;s a campfire story or a $200 million blockbuster movie. There is only one winner in Storyteller but every player takes away an amazing prize - a unique story that they all created together.<br/><br/>The game set for Storyteller contains 200 cards which are divided into two different types: plot and ending cards. Plot cards contain elements of the future story: the heroes, places, objects, events and other characteristics. Each ending card has a final sentence for the story written on them. When developing a story, the players illustrate it by taking plot cards from their hands and placing them onto the table. As the game progresses, players take turns telling the story. Each player is trying to steer the tale in a direction that would ultimately fit their ending card. Since the ending cards are all quite different, each player will attempt to tailor the story in a different way, causing the plot to take notorious twists and turns.<br/><br/>",

There are 60 different meat cards in the game, with a picture and name on the front and some facts on the meat on the back (e.g. how many carbs it contains). At the start of the game every player receives 3 cards. You may only see the front of the cards, the facts side will be facing your opponents. Divide the remaining meat cards in half to make two face up decks. There are 12 theme cards in the game with assignments on what what requirements the meat must meet. Shuffle the theme cards and place 3 face up for everyone to see. The start player picks one of these cards to be active that round. Starting with the start player and going clockwise everyone plays one of their meat cards (picture side up). Choosing the card they think best matches the requirements of the theme card this round. Since everyone sees the facts on other players cards, but not their own, players may negotiate or advice each other on which card to choose. Lying is allowed. When everyone has put down their card, turn over all played cards and check whose card matches the theme best. That player wins the theme card and a new theme card is put in its place. Played meat cards are discarded. The game resumes with the next player clockwise being the new start player. All players pick a new meat card from one of the two open decks, beginning with the new start player. The first player who collects 3 theme cards is the winner and receives the title of Meat Master.<br/><br/>The more you play the game the more you'll learn on meat. The data on the meat cards is based on the Standard Tables of Food Composition published by the Japanese Ministry of Education, Culture, Sports, Science and Technology.<br/><br/>",

        "description": "Stop-Gate is a two-player game of perfect information. It can be played on a board or as a paper and pencil game.  As a board game, the game uses a checkerboard and a set of dominoes.  As pencil and paper game, players can take turns coloring in squares on a grid (there is no capturing or movement, so there is no need to erase anything during the game).<br/><br/>Stop-Gate is taken from the book On Numbers and Games by John Conway (Academic Press, 1976) and is attributed to Goran Andersson on page 74. In the book Conway doesn't really give the game any name.<br/><br/>It appears in Berlekamp, Conway, and Guy's Winning Ways for Your Mathematical Plays, where it is called Domineering, or Crosscram. There it says that &quot;[t]his game has been considered by Goran Andersson&quot;, so it is not clear if the designer credit given here is accurate.<br/><br/>Stop-Gate is played with the standard winning condition for combinatorial games, which is that the player who makes the last legal move wins. A legal move consists of placing a domino on two unoccupied spaces on the board (or coloring in two adjacent squares). One player can only place dominoes horizontally, and the other can only place vertically. Typically, the game decomposes into smaller open regions, which may be of benefit to one player or the other.<br/><br/>An impartial variant exists where neither player has a restriction on the orientation of their dominoes. This is also called Cram.<br/><br/>",

Thus they can only capture an opponent's piece adjacent to their own position. <br/>     Kings are flying. They may move over any amount of empty fields or capture a piece in any amount of empty fields' distance away as long as the adjacent field behind the captured piece is empty. Anyway if a king captures, it may land on any empty field immediately behind or following empty fields in straight line of the captured piece unless it is required to stop on a specific field in order to continue jumping according to the rule of capturing maximum amount of opponent's pieces.<br/>     Any capture move may be performed by men or kings in any direction - forwards or backwards.<br/>     Each jump is performed in a straight line over any single opponent's piece. The adjacent field behind the pieces captured must be free.<br/>     A possible chained jump can consist of single jumps having a combination of same or even different directions.<br/>     In a chained capture move opponent's pieces are removed only after capturing is complete.<br/>     During a chained capture a piece may not be jumped more than once. But it is allowed to revisit or jump over any empty field multiple times then.<br/>     There is no breezing as a penalty for captures that are not performed.<br/><br/><br/>",

        "description": "Octopath is a tile laying, road building and discovery game for two or more players. Players control crews of dwarves operating in an unexplored part of the country. The dwarves build roadways on the valley floors, and mine the mountains, following rumours of great wealth to be found: emeralds, sapphires, rubies and gold. But not all mountains have a source of wealth. Some have mines which initially look promising, but result in dead ends. Others are not suitable for mining at all, and the dwarves just build passes into the next valley.<br/><br/>You try to earn bags of gold by getting your crews to build looping roads that the farmers in the valleys use, and roads that run from one mine to another. But beware, other dwarven crews are also building roads and excavating in the mountains, and they can join their road up with one of your roads to capitalize on your finds, or make one of your roads join two dead ends, losing you money!<br/><br/>There are two types of tiles used in Octopath. Larger octagonal tiles are the valley floors, and are just used to construct roads. Each valley tile has four road sections each with entry/exit points on two of the 8 sides of the octagon. There are 72 tiles consisting of 4 copies of each of 18 different tiles. When placed edge to edge, the road segments join into meandering roads.<br/><br/>Octagonal tiles do not tessellate &ndash; when you place four octagonal tiles touching each other, there is a small square space between them. The square spaces represent the mountains, and when the mountains are explored, small mountain tiles are placed in the square spaces. Each mountain tile has four road entry/exit points, one on each side. These may join together to form passes through the mountains, or may lead to a terminus, which is either a mine of a specific type (red = ruby, green = emerald, blue = sapphire, yellow = gold), or a dead end.<br/><br/>",

Nowadays, children buy colourful plastic stones instead of finding pebbles. It can be played alone or with friends. The stones are called gonggitdol (공깃돌. Since only a few stones and a flat surface are needed for play, the game can be played by anyone almost anywhere. An equivalent game also exists in Nepal and is known as 'gatti'.<br/><br/>The game is also called Jjagebatgi in North Gyeongsang Province, Salgu in South Gyeongsang Province, and Datjjakgeoli in South Jeolla Province.<br/><br/>Gameplay<br/>The game generally begins with each player tossing the stones from the palm of their hand into the air. While airborne, the player switches their hand backside up. The gonggi stones are then caught on the back of the hand. The person with the leading amount plays first.<br/><br/>How to play gonggi<br/>Level 1: The stones are thrown on the playing surface and the player picks a stone to throw up in the air. While airborne, the player picks up one stone on the playing surface. Then, the player catches the stone. These steps are repeated until all the stones have been caught.<br/>Level 2: The stones are thrown on the playing surface again. However, at this level, the player picks up the stones two at a time.<br/>Level 3: The stones are thrown on the playing surface. The stones are picked up once in a cluster of three, and the other in the amount of one.<br/>Level 4: The player throws one stone in the air, places the others on the surface, and catches the airborne stone. Then the player tosses the same stone again, but this time, picks up the four clustered stones on the playing surface and catches the airborne stone.<br/>Level 5: The player tosses the stones from the palm of their hand into the air. While airborne, the player switches his hand backside up. The stones are then caught on the back of the hand. Then, the player throws the stones in the air and catches them. The number of stones caught amount to the score. There are various tricks in this phase. Some examples are &quot;The Dragon&quot; and &quot;The Clap&ndash;Toss&quot;. However, such ostentations are not allowed in official game play.<br/><br/>Various tricks in Level 5<br/>Dragon<br/>While the stones are airborne, the player switches their hand backside up, catches several stones, switches their hand backside down, and catches the stones that are left over.<br/><br/>Clap Toss<br/>While the stones are airborne, the player claps their hand before catching the stones.<br/><br/>Both &ldquo;dragon&rdquo; and &ldquo;clap-toss&rdquo; gives the player twice the score; twice the number of stones.<br/><br/>&mdash;description from wikipedia<br/><br/>",

No game master needed, all you have to do is play four cards.<br/><br/>Each player is dealt a duplicate preset hand of action cards before the game. Some are &quot;Murder&quot;, some &quot;Investigate (Accuse)&quot;, some &quot;Guard&quot;, and so on.But unlike Werewolf-style games, there is no predefined role. You choose your own role in game.<br/><br/>There are four rounds in a game, and you play one card per round. If you ever play a &quot;Murder&quot; card, you took the &quot;Murderer&quot; role. Otherwise, you are the opposing &quot;Investigator&quot; role. Since you can't draw additional cards in the game, if you check your remaining hand it is obvious which role you played.<br/><br/>You must act as either a Murderer trying not to get caught, or as a Detective to accuse the culprit. Every player has an urge for murder, but if you failed to cover your tracks, you would be accused and have to drop out of the game.<br/><br/>You get 5 points if you survive, 5 points if you successfully manage to murder the mansion owner, 3 points for killing other players, or 4 points for a successful accusation... The player with the most points at the end of the fourth day is the winner.<br/><br/>Should your murderous intentions rule you or keep your good will? Should you act as a murderer or act as a detective? It's all up to you.<br/><br/>After the first edition was released, a revised edition was produced. An additional set of cards was added for a 6 player game, the artwork was modified and the card text and manual were improved to be more precise.<br/><br/>Publisher's summary<br/>「スノーマンション」はゲームマスター等の必要無しにお手軽にカードを四枚選択するだけの<br/>短時間・少人数で遊べる推理テイストな隠匿系ゲームです。<br/>他のプレイヤーにバレないよう殺人を行ったりもしくは探偵として殺人犯を指摘し勝敗を競います。<br/>プレイヤーは各々殺意を持っていますが<br/>殺したとバレれば殺人犯として吊るし上げられゲームから脱落してしまいます。<br/>生き残れば5点、館の主を殺せば5点、他の誰かを殺せば3点、殺人犯を告発すれば4点・・・<br/><br/>四日目終了時に点数の一番高いプレイヤーの勝利です。<br/>殺意に身を委ねるか良心で抗うか&hellip;&hellip;殺人犯になるか探偵になるかはあなた次第です。<br/><br/>",

Shout your deal and swap cards to collect a set. Be the first player to grab all the cards of one fun food (Pizza, Burgers, Veggies, Cookies and more), then HIT THE PIT and win the round! You then score points depending on which set you have.  Two cards (hungry Bear and chef Bull) may be used to add wild/penalty cards to the gameplay.<br/><br/>This game is virtually the same as the classic version of Pit - it has 65 cards, including 7 commodities with 9 in each commodity, as well as the Bull and Bear cards.<br/><br/>The only actual difference - other than the aesthetics - is that the point values for each commodity have been changed in comparison to the classic version - the commodities are now valued are 100, 80, 75, 65, 60, 55, 50 instead of the classic values of 100, 85, 75, 70, 60, 50, 40.<br/><br/>",

However, Japanese habit of apologizing is still alive over generations, and a new method of apologizing is invented, which is called Shimatsusho (Letter of Apology).<br/><br/>A Shimatsusho is created through a magical ritual in which you inscribe lengthy and complicated magic words onto a sheet of A4-sized paper, in order that you never cause such a disaster again.<br/><br/>Apology Showdown is a card game in which you, as a mid-level manager of a company, hand out a Shimatsusho to your boss. You lose the game if you can't get rid of most critical Shimatsusho. You should report the most urgent Shimatsusho first. With countless troubles, your boss won't accept less urgent Shimatsusho. As a competent business person, you know which one you should hand out first.<br/><br/>Publisher's summary<br/>江戸幕府の終焉から150年。文明開化とともに日本社会からハラキリが姿を消しましたが、謝ることをDNAに刻んでいる日本人はそれに代わる新たな贖罪のメソッドを生み出しました。それが始末書(Shimatsusho)です。これはA4のコピー用紙に超大で複雑な呪文を綴ることで災厄の再発を防ごうとする魔術の一種です。<br/>「どっちの始末Show」は始末書を上司に提出するトリックテイキングゲームです。危険な始末書を最後まで提出せずに抱えていたプレイヤーがゲームに敗北します。<br/>緊急度の高い始末書は早めに報告するのが社会人の嗜み。しかし、トラブルに忙殺される上司は緊急度の低い始末書を容易に受け取ってはくれません。<br/>ならば先に提出しなければならない始末書はどっちなのか&hellip;&hellip;？　優秀な中間管理職であるあなたならきっとそれが分かるはずです！<br/><br/>",

The result is a fast-paced, fun, dice-rolling game based on my popular Journal of an Outlaw book series!<br/>Each character plays a rogue trying to open a treasure chest that is protected by 10 locks. Each player takes turns rolling their polyhedral dice to see if they make the combination and open the locks. If unsuccessful at opening a lock, they arm a trap. They get one more chance to pick the lock, and failure means taking damage!<br/><br/>Players take turns trying to open their treasure chest, they are not only trying to get treasure, but must also live to the end! Hit points are exchanged for gold at the end of the game. Whoever winds up with the most gold wins! There are also special skills that can be earned to help your rogue achieve success.<br/><br/>From the designer's webpage<br/><br/>",

Players will need to cooperate, negotiate, share and learn to work as a team in order to achieve a common goal and win the game.<br/><br/>What's unusual?<br/><br/>The most novel thing about this game is the playing field, which is constructed by the players during the game.<br/><br/>The card forming the shape of the paddock is a 7&times;7 square. The ponies and the hay go inside, filling out a 5&times;5 square. As soon as the outer perimeter of the paddock closes, the ponies can no longer walk out and the game is lost. However, if we manage to fill the 5&times;5 paddock with ponies and hay, then the game is won. Remember, the secret is to work together!<br/><br/>How to play?<br/><br/>During his turn a player needs to take two types of action &ndash; one prevents victory, while the other brings it closer.<br/><br/>What prevents victory is the need to build the paddock by playing all the available fence cards in one&rsquo;s hand.<br/><br/>What brings it closer is putting 3 ponies which have some trait in common into the paddock or using the horseshoe to break two fence cards or adding one hay card into the paddock.<br/><br/>Note that players can share cards to help each other collect the three ponies that they need. You can also discuss and plan moves together, as well as judge whether or not a certain action will be useful. The players are not competing, they are trying to win by working together.<br/><br/>In order to win, the players need to fill the paddock with hay and ponies before the fence is completed. Otherwise the game is lost.<br/><br/>Who can play?<br/><br/>This game is ideal for children who are 4+ years old, as well as mixed groups of kids and adults and families. Great as a fun activity in day care centers, at parties and during trips.<br/><br/>",

        "description": "Indian Ocean Adventure, designed by Marc Miller and released in 1978 by Game Designers Workshop, simulates the Japanese raid on the British bases in Ceylon in early 1942 and uses the same basic concepts and rules used by the designer in his previous games, Coral Sea and Battle for Midway.  It includes special design features to simulate the fluidity of modern naval actions dominated by aircraft rather than surface gunfire, including turn segments decided by an initiative factor and local weather variations, so common in the Pacific and Indian Oceans. Each counter represents a single capital ship or about 8 aircraft. Complex features such as aircraft maintenance and efficiency of land airfields are represented in the game rules.<br/><br/>This is an unusual subject. There certainly aren't many games that contain Fulmars, Albacores and Walrus in the counter mix.<br/><br/>The game includes:<br/>240 counters, printed on one side only <br/>A 22&quot; x 28&quot; mapsheets <br/>A Rule Book <br/>Player aids and charts <br/>A pad of combination Ship Status and Location Chart sheets<br/><br/>",

There are several ways to achieve victory ranging from economic growth to all out militaristic control of the universe. Diplomacy is not to be neglected either, as the more powerful game changes are brought up in Babylon 5 council vote to be decided.<br/><br/>You construct your playing 'board' using hexagonal shaped pieces that come with the game. The various pieces are different and can represent a multitude of things so that the game is different every time you play. In addition to the board and the ships that move on it, there are cards. Players may buy cards allowing special actions above and beyond the normal game, like an extra move or more EPs.<br/><br/>Using your faction's wealth and resources you play the game and explore the map. You search for planets to colonize and possibly conquer. Use your fleets to engage in battles and use characters to assist you in reaching your faction's goals.

        "description": "Major General John Pope took command of the new Army of Virginia, and he wanted to bring a more aggressive posture to the Federal command. When Stonewall Jackson's Confederate wing moved north around the Union flank, Pope seized the opportunity to attack and attempt to destroy Jackson's force. Robert E. Lee, in overall command of the southern army in the area, had no intention of sitting passively. He aggressively sent Longstreet's wing to unite with Jackson, hoping to disrupt the US forces and commit to battle on favorable terms, even though the northerners had superior numbers. A number of battles were fought during this campaign, including the major battle of Second Bull Run.<br/><br/>More Aggressive Attitudes is an operational-level game for two players exploring the 1862 Virginia Campaign. Each hex represents a span of five miles, and each turn is a day. The counter density is low - just a handful of units per side - and the rules are simple, but nuanced. The focus is squarely on the operational level, and the ability of your subordinates to carry out your orders - to march a given distance in a day, to avoid battle, or to coordinate their attacks - is not entirely within your control. This uncertainty is simulated by a series of die rolls. (Don't worry about &quot;wristage&quot;; in practice, it's only a few rolls per turn.)<br/><br/>A number of chromey bits effortlessly recreate the particulars of this campaign without ever getting in the way of your decision-making and agency. The result is a compelling operational sandbox for gamers both old and new.<br/><br/>",

The playing pieces represent the actual units that participated, or could have participated, in those battles, and the maps show the militarily significant terrain over which the units fought or could have fought.<br/><br/>The El Arish '67 battle game simulates the initial Israeli onslaught into the Sinai, which led to their spectacular triumph over the Egyptians a few days later.  This opening battle could've gone much better for the Egyptians.  They had actually planned a strong mechanized counterattack, but their high command lost their nerve at the last moment and ordered a general withdrawal instead.

        "description": "Based on iconic seasonal flowers found in Japan, Kuzushi Seasons  pits 2, 3 or 4 players against each other in a unique game of positional influence and control. Simple rules lead to beautiful complexities in this abstract area control tile placement card game. It's smart, fun, approachable and addictive.<br/><br/>Card placement and area control is all resolved orthogonally to other cards. So up, down, left and right only. Players try to control more of the board through influence from the base cards they play on each turn. Then they check up, down, left and right of the base they place to see what player (if any) has a majority of base cards around it. If no one has more bases than anyone else around it, that square is uncontrolled, and any flag there is returned to its owner, which they can again either as a base or a flag as required.<br/><br/>This makes for a dynamic board that gets built out into a square as play continues (6x6 for 2 players, 7x7 for 3 players, or 8x8 for 4 players). Once the boundaries are established, play continues until all the board is filled. The winner is the player who has the most cards of their color on the board. If there's a tie, the player with the largest &quot;island&quot; of their color cards touching is the winner.<br/><br/>&mdash;description of the publisher<br/><br/>",

He then receives feedback on this code, being told how many dice are equal to the corresponding die in the code, how many are higher and how many are lower. When he thinks he has guessed the code, or after he has used up his seven rounds, he makes a guess. If this guess is correct, he scores a number of points, depending on the amount of rounds and dice used.<br/><br/>After this, the rolls are reveresed, and the other player has to break a code. The player with the highest score wins.<br/><br/>",

With the Great Pyramid of Khufu and the Great Sphinx at Giza, Nubia lay along the river Nile.<br/><br/>In Nubia: Ancient Kingdoms of the Nile, the players are Pharaohs. They each make their own kingdom, with a Great Pyramid and a Royal family supported by nobility. By using their building skills and spending wheat, stone and wood, their kingdom rises step by step. The winner is the player with the greatest kingdom, judged on their pyramid, their nobles and their gold.<br/><br/>In more detail, each player places building cards in front of them, like a pyramid. Higher cards must be supported from below, and they cost more to build, with payment being made when constructed. The new step triggers production from the cards in the pyramid to the left and right, going down from the active card, so planning ahead is very important to success. Each player worships their own God, which brings them benefits. There are more than twenty types of building cards, with many combinations.<br/><br/>",

But soon enough they'll have the sky!<br/><br/>Legends of Dsyx: Derelict Dirigible is a solitaire roll-and-write adventure game in which players build an airship and use it to go on adventures. Each turn, the player rolls dice to scavenge resources; these resources can then be used to construct various airships parts. The parts are selected from a menu, all have different sizes and resource requirements, and must be connected in order to function, by being drawn by the player in a grid. Players must manage their resources and fuel to create a versatile airship, as adventures have specific lift and speed requirements in order to be successfully completed.<br/><br/>Once the last hourglass is filled in on the time track, the session is over and scores are calculated. Players can compete with others or themselves to earn the highest score, indicating airship virtuosity!<br/><br/><br/>Released in the October 2018 Board Game of the Month Club $5+ package.<br/><br/>",

Detect the greatest number of clues and win the game.<br/><br/>Contents:<br/> &middot;  40 aroma reference vials<br/> &middot;  4 flavor reference vials<br/> &middot;  100 fill-in wine-tasting forms<br/> &middot;  2 wine-tasting guides<br/> &middot;  1 measuring spoon<br/> &middot;  1 glass Testaroma<br/><br/>Method:<br/>The game unfolds in two phases: 1) Training players to recognize the aromas found in wine; 2) Observation and tasting of the wine itself.<br/><br/>1st Phase: Acquainting players with the aromas. This phase may constitute a full-fledged game in itself (see Variant below).  It is then a challenge of trying to guess the scent in each aroma vial (the answer is on the bottom).<br/><br/>These aromas are divided into 4 groups:<br/> &middot;  21 primary reference aromas (varietal aromas), ex: leather, licorice, apricot, etc....<br/> &middot;  7 secondary aromas (wine-making aromas), ex: cinnamon, lemon, etc....<br/> &middot;  7 tertiary aromas (aromas of aging), ex: prune, mushroom, etc....<br/> &middot;  5 odors indicating the principal defects found in wine, ex: detergent, cork, etc....<br/><br/>2nd Phase: The game itself. Each players has been asked to bring a bottle of wine.  All players have taken care to conceal the label from the other players.  The person whose wine is being tasted will temporarily be the game moderator while all others will try to answer the questions regarding the wine&rsquo;s origin, vintage, grape varietal, defects, vinification process, aging potential, outcome, balance, etc.  Sounds difficult or impossible?  It&rsquo;s not&mdash;and here&rsquo;s why&hellip;<br/><br/>The accompanying wine-tasting guides provide all of the pertinent observations in wine-tasting.  The players&rsquo; challenge is to accurately match the observations of the wine you are tasting with the ones listed in the guides.  Alongside each observation you will find the interpretations or answers.  For example, if you observe a red wine with a ruby shade and a brick reflection, the interpretation will be a &ldquo;2- to 5-year old&rdquo; wine.  A Champagne or sparkling wine with small and fast bubbles is a &ldquo;quality sparkling wine.&rdquo;<br/><br/>Bacchanales was developed for wine-lovers of all levels, allowing participants to improve and perfect their knowledge in wine-tasting with each round.  On average, 80 percent of all people who have no prior wine experience can answer 3 out of 5 questions accurately.  In just one round, participants will become true connoisseurs, discovering the many secrets of wine-tasting.<br/><br/>Variant:<br/>If your friends are Boardgame Geeks rather than wine-lovers, you can always forgo a regular game of Bacchanales to play a game of &ldquo;Scent Identity.&rdquo;  This variant using olfactory memory is original and very instructive: Randomly select 10 or 12 of the aroma vials (a greater number makes the game a little long and difficult). On a sheet of paper, draw a corresponding number of circles.  Label the circles with the names of the selected aromas.  Mix the aroma vials.  Set a time limit and have each player attempt to place the correct vial on the correct name!<br/><br/>",

Obstacles to achieving your goals include gun battles with other mobsters (players), police chases when robberies go wrong, and stints in the hospital recovering from gunshot wounds, or being sent up the river to the Big House.<br/><br/>To aid you in your quest, you hire cronies to carry out your bidding, and gain influence through &quot;power tokens&quot;.<br/><br/>These can be used to bribe city officials when you end up in court.

This is done by connecting the machine parts with a line of dominoes (standing up, so that they can be toppled, not lying down).<br/><br/>At the start of Tims T&uuml;ftel-Team, several cardboard tokens representing the machine parts are scattered along the table. The game is played in rounds; in each round, two tokens have to be connected. At the start of the first round, one token is selected as the starting token, and this also dictates which token will be the destination token. In later rounds, the destination token from the previous round becomes the starting token.<br/><br/>Now, the players take turns placing dominoes in the line from the start token to the destination token, building past any other tokens. Each turn, a player rolls a die, which allows him to add zero to three dominoes to the line. When the destination token is reached, the round ends. The player whose turn it is gets to topple the dominoes by pushing the first domino in the line. First, though, the other players have to predict whether or not the entire line of dominoes will fall.<br/><br/>After predictions have been made, the first domino is toppled. If the entire line falls, then the toppling player receives a gift token, as well as any player who made the right prediction; if some dominoes remain standing, the players who predicted that receive a gift token.<br/><br/>After six rounds, the game ends, and the player who has gained the most gift tokens wins.<br/><br/>In the expert version of the game, various contraptions for connecting two lines of dominoes are included, and in each round, one of these is included in the line of dominoes connecting the start and destination.<br/><br/>",

        "description": "Strike &amp; Counterstrike (SCS) is purpose-designed solitaire wargame that covers the Soviet counteroffensive against German Army Group Center (AGC) from early December 1941 to the end of April 1942. The single player actively commands the Soviet forces, while the rules system directs him in the deployment of the opposing German force. The player wins with the Soviets by seizing control of key territorial objectives. Games may also end in draws or German victories. Strike &amp; Counterstrike shares the same system with Rampage, Stalingrad Cauldron, and Panzers East, there are differences in their details of play. That&rsquo;s due to the differences in the time and space scales in the individual games, as well as the fact I&rsquo;m always further developing my views in regard to the best particulars for use in Solitaire systems.

        "description": "User summary<br/>ゲット★スイートラブ (Get★Sweet Love) is a Japanese card game of match-making, but with somewhat adult themes and language.<br/><br/>In the game, players are dealt hand cards and draw and play more cards through the game. There are four female character cards dealt face up on the table, and the players are girl-chasers, competing to win the 'best' one. But which woman is best is only determined at the finish.<br/><br/>During the game, players play hand cards against their chosen targets. These attribute cards have positive values for virtues, and negative values for bad behaviour. Some cards are played face-up, some face-down, so there is a strong element of bluffing in the game. Some attribute cards alter the rules as they are played.<br/><br/>The game is very social and encourages table talk about the good or bad attributes. For example, during game play, players will talk up the virtues of one girl, and talk down the vices of another. &quot;She is Born Rich! That's 6 points! I'm after her.&quot; &quot;But she's also a Money-Waster. -8 points. Are you sure you want her? hehehe.&quot;<br/>&quot;You know what? This girl is so Gentle and Kind and worth 8 points!&quot; &quot;Poor you. You might have not known, but actually, she is a B*tch. -6 points!&quot; &quot;Oh no, she's a B*tch and also likes Kinky Sex? Oh my oh my...&quot;<br/><br/>Players also put secret tokens on the female cards, to show their likes or dislikes. After the cards have been played, the players must 'Express Love' by simultaneously pointing at the woman they chose. If only player chooses one woman, they get her. If more than player points at one woman, the player with the highest token wins her.<br/><br/>Then all the attribute cards are flipped and the value of the different women is calculated. The player who picked the best woman, wins!<br/><br/>There are two Versions of the game, this original edition is themed on men trying to get the best girlfriend. There is another edition with the genders swapped, and the women are trying to get the best boyfriend - ゲット★スマートラブ (Get★Smart Love). Whilst the games are very similar, there are differences in the special cards which affect the gameplay. With both editions, you can combine and play an 8 player game.<br/><br/>The game name has a couple of twists. The English name can be abbreviated to Ge★S Love, which for Japanese readers equates to 'guess love', trying to guess which girl to choose. But the name ゲスラブ in Japanese, has the word ゲス in it, which is used in many vulgar or even obscene words in Japanese. So the publisher is deliberately signalling to buyers that the game is for adults but still sociable, since the girl-chasers will be nice to some girls, and not so nice to others. This version has gone through ten reprints in Japan and always draws a crowd at game shows, with its risque design (by Japanese standards).<br/><br/>Publisher's summary<br/>グループ交際の中で相手の女性に様々な『属性』を付与し<br/>最も点数の高い女性を恋人にした人が勝利。<br/>通称ゲスラブ（Guess Love）<br/><br/>Get★Smart Loveと混ぜて1名～8名で遊ぶ事も可能。<br/><br/>",

        "description": "Takeover is a stock game with simulations of standard market mechanics and an additional twist of &quot;hostile takeovers&quot;. Players must build up their financial portfolio by risking money on long or short selling, playing the variations in the market, using margins and generally speculating. Players roll and move around a Monopoly-type board, with landing spaces and card draws giving various options. The board features an outer track where stocks can generally be purchased, and an inner criss-cross track where gambles and takeovers predominate. Purchasing of stock is unlike standard Monopoly exclusivity: when landing on a square, the active player may purchase up to 40% of available stock, and then all other players may also purchase stock. Disclosure rules generally limit ownership levels except for takeover situations. Typical brokerage mechanisms such as longs, shorts, margin calls, warrants, Futures, dividends, etc. are incorporated into the game.<br/><br/>The game comes with three difficulty levels, with the goal of the full-difficulty-version involving acquisition of shares in every company in one of the four &quot;market groups&quot; and absolute majority of one of the companies in that group.<br/><br/>This game was endorsed by the Toronto Stock Exchange.<br/><br/>",

Hero Brigade 2 introduces new Heroes and Villains and new rules for 3 and 4-player tag team battles in combination with the original game.<br/><br/>Each character card can be played in three different ways (deployed to your Party's Front Row, deployed to your Support Row, or used for a one-time game effect). Hero Brigade also offers unique twists on conventional deck-building mechanisms. Drawing extra cards and eliminating your starting cards can hurt you in the long term as you permanently lose cards from your deck each time you reshuffle and each time one of your characters is defeated.

        "description": "Wehrschach, also called Tak-Tik, was published by the nationalsocialist German magazine &quot;Die Wehrmacht&quot; in 1937/1938. It brought modern pieces to a Chess-like board: Infantry, Armor, Fighter and Bomber planes, Artillery, and a unique piece (the 'Hauptfigur'), styled like an eagle, which abstractly represented the government, industrial base, and morale of the state.<br/><br/>On an Board with 11 x 11 squares you play a chess-like game with 18 pieces per player, for instance the &quot;Jagdflieger&quot; or the &quot;Panzerkampfwagen&quot;, all 3D and of Bakelite. These can move only vertical or horizontal, but a different number of squares, with the exception of the &quot;Panzerkampfwagen&quot;, which might also move like the knight in chess, but without jumping over other pieces.<br/><br/>To capture an enemy piece you need to threaten it with two of your pieces instead of just one.<br/><br/>The board is divided through diagonal lines (the main road and the river) and two more lines crossing the 3rd and 9th row indicating walls and two lake tiles which block all movement except for the planes.<br/><br/>Gameplay was more or less like chess, but with some special rules for the different figures. There were several ways to win: capture of the Hauptfigur; destruction of all enemy Infantry; reduction of his fighting power; occupation of his homeland; etc. This, coupled with the two-to-one capture rules makes it more challenging (and rewarding!) than Chess.<br/><br/>",

Otherwise parrot Koko will raise the alarm and reckless mutiny will ensue. Which pirate with good memory skills will be the fastest at snatching and win the most treasure pieces?<br/><br/>Reckless Mutiny is a memory game about pirates dividing their booty according to the old pirate law. Players take turns drawing a booty card, showing it to all other players, then placing it face down in front of a pirate &ndash; but no pirate may get two cards in a row with the same kind of booty or with booty of the same color, so you must always remember the last card placed in front of each pirate.<br/><br/>If a player thinks a booty card was misplaced, he grabs the parrot and shouts &quot;Reckless Mutiny!&quot; Players look at their booty cards, and if the card was placed incorrectly, the player who grabbed the parrot gets the booty card. If the card was placed correctly, the player who placed that card &ndash; that is, the one who was wrongfully accused &ndash; gets the card instead. Play continues until all 56 booty cards have been distributed, and whoever acquires the most cards wins.<br/><br/>Reckless Mutiny includes variants for more experienced players. One variant use the money cards in the booty deck, with the captains needing to place all of these cards in numerical order. Thus, if a money card is drawn, the player must recall all the other money cards already played and place that card in the right position. In another variant you flip a coin to determine whether you place booty cards as in the basic game or whether you place them on a card that shares at least one common characteristic (color or kind of booty).<br/><br/>",

Whoever has collected 5000 points wins. The main objective in the different rounds is to make 7-Streets. These are collections of at least 7 of the same number cards (poss. supplemented with jokers). 7-Streets will give extra bonus points. You also need at least one 7-Street to be able to count the points on the table.<br/><br/>It is important during the game to pay attention to what cards the players lay on the table and on the discard pile. This can give you valuable information about what cards you can probably pass on the discard pile without being caught by the player after you, but your opponent can deceive you... So be careful which card you play, because one wrong card on the discard pile can have major consequences!<br/><br/>",

Cards can be humans, zombies, infected humans, cops or bombs. On each turn a player has to draw a card and then play a card.<br/><br/>Human cards (with values 1 to 5) are played in front of them and represent the people they have saved.<br/><br/>Zombies are played so that other player has to discard some of their human cards (which ones and how many depend on the zombie played).<br/><br/>Infected humans are very bad cards to have in your hand because they eat two human cards from the same player.<br/><br/>Cops can act as heroes and sacrifice themselves to save humans when attacked by zombies.<br/><br/>Finally bomb cards have 2 uses. They can be used to stop a zombie attack, or they can be used in any turn to gain an additional card to your hand. Either way a bomb would have exploded in &quot;La Moneda&quot;.<br/><br/>When the sixth bomb explodes the game will end and the player with more humans saved will win the game!<br/><br/><br/>Editorial Tabula Rasa presenta &quot;Zombies en La Moneda: Juego de Cartas&quot;, producto basado en el exitoso c&oacute;mic chileno hom&oacute;nimo de Mythica Ediciones.<br/><br/>ZeLM:JdC es un juego de cartas no coleccionables &aacute;gil, entretenido y r&aacute;pido de aprender, para disfrutar de 2 a 6 jugadores.

La misi&oacute;n se dar&aacute; por terminada una vez que las 6 bater&iacute;as humanas, que se encuentran dentro del Palacio de La Moneda, sean detonadas.<br/><br/>Objetivo Secundario: Protege a la ciudadan&iacute;a. Rescata a la mayor cantidad de personas posible y evita que sean v&iacute;ctimas de ataques zombies.

Finishing it blocks the possibility to build its corresponding, alternative Construction. Each Construction unlocks new Order cards or supports players during the siege in other ways.

        "description": "This is one of the Jamie Swise murder-mystery role-playing games published by Just Games. It was later published by Milton Bradley as part of their &quot;Life of the Party&quot; line beginning in 1987.<br/><br/>Episode: Who Killed Roger Ellington?<br/><br/>The Plot: Post-war America was thriving in 1948, as was murder in a small Massachusetts town. Industrialist Roger Ellington was cut-down in the prime of his sordid life. After eating a plate of snails, he succumbed to what appeared to be a most deadly strain of indigestion.<br/><br/>The Time: Aug. 9, 1948<br/><br/>The Place: Washington Station, Massachusetts<br/><br/>The Cast:<br/><br/>Major Deegan: Lifetime resident of Washington Station. Deegan was Roger's chief competitor for women, status &ndash; everything for as long as anyone could remember. A well-trained mercenary, Deegan returned to town shortly after the war, satisfied that he and a few others had saved theWestern world from evil. He couldn't remember where he was the night of Roger's death.<br/><br/>Derrick Ellington: Stepbrother of the deceased, had been away in the Merchant Marines for ten years, returning to town a year ago. Derrick became engaged to Sara Admunson after his return. She died shortly after in an auto accident. A drunken Roger was driving her home from a party when he lost control of the car. Derrick crawled into a bottle shortly after the funeral and never came out. Always looked down upon by his brother, Derrick never &quot;lived up&quot; to the Ellington name. Perhaps that is why he sought refuge in the Merchant Marines for all those years. He couldn't remember where he was the evening of the murder.<br/><br/>Cybil Admunson: Sister of the late Sara. It was common knowledge that Cybil loved Roger. A social climber, Cybil was not liked by many. At her sister's funeral she exchanged some pretty harsh words with Roger. While deciding on which college to attend next, she worked as hostess at L'Escargot. She was on duty that night.<br/><br/>Arnold Green: Boston College student working at L'Escargot for the summer. Green was not a born waiter, and was publicly humiliated by Roger on several occasions. Green served that evening.<br/><br/>Yvonne Drake: Master pastry chef at L'Escargot, she came from Paris shortly after the war. A cold &quot;foreigner&quot;, she did not mix easily with the locals. However, she was having a rather obvious affair with Steve Watson. Yvonne was in and out of the kitchen all evening.<br/><br/>Steve Watson: Young, energetic man who come from Boston in 1946. Steve was well liked and was Roger's business partner in many deals. He was president of the local Chamber of Commerce. He dined with Roger and Gastonne that evening.<br/><br/>Gastonne Schmidt: Owner and head chef of L'Escargot. Since his arrival from Paris a year and a half ago, Schmidt had become known as an arrogant yet likable eccentric. He gave the town a bit of European class, and his gruffness only added atmosphere to his establishment in the eyes of the townspeople. He dined with Roger that evening.<br/><br/>Katie LaFemme: Local party girl with the proverbial heart of gold. Having had a painful on-again-off-again affair with Roger, Katie knew of his dark disposition. She once bellowed from her roost in Jerry's Bar, &quot;Someone ought to put him out of my misery!&quot; She also couldn't remember where she was that evening.<br/><br/>Game Includes:<br/>Full Plot Scenario <br/>Character Biographies<br/>Recorded Introduction<br/>24 Clues <br/>Solution<br/><br/>",

On their turn, a player roles the dice and moves the bus forward and depending on the squares they land on, there are different actions to perform. At a green light, one may roll the dice again and at a bus stop, passengers get on board. On some squares, passengers leave the bus and on a color spot, one loses one passenger to the bus of that color. When arriving to each players town, passengers get off the bus, but if another bus is already there, one has to move on. Also if two buses meet on the road, a passenger goes to the newly arrived bus. The player who brings six passengers into his town first wins the game.<br/><br/>",

        "description": "S-P-O-N-G-E: Fight the Evil is a customizable card game based on the adventures of S-P-O-N-G-E (see <a target='_blank' href=\"http://s-p-o-n-g-e.com\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer noopener\">http://s-p-o-n-g-e.com</a>), an online role-playing organization devoted to H. P. Lovecraft's Cthulhu mythos (it took me quite a while to find out that &quot;SPONGE&quot; stands for &quot;Stopping Powerful Organisms from N Gulfing Everything&quot;).  It is nominally a two-player game but can handle more players quite readily.<br/><br/>In the game, each player is a SPONGE Historian, helping out on an investigation.  The Historian position at SPONGE is often a short-lived one, and the &quot;Inactive Files&quot; are full of past Historians that didn&rsquo;t make it.  The object of the game is to last longer than any of your fellow Historians.<br/><br/>Each player also represents the forces of Evil that threaten to thwart SPONGE at every turn.  This means that you will be playing cards on your opponents as often as you play them on yourself.<br/><br/>Every Historian has his or her own deck of cards, comprised of seven categories: Locations (where your investigation takes you), Characters (people you encounter), Items (stuff you find), Weapons (stuff you find that will kill Beasts), Beasts (an assortment of creatures bent on killing you), Tomes (knowledge man was not meant to know) and Events (things that just happen to happen).<br/><br/>Each turn you normally get two Action Points.  It costs an Action Point to draw a card, play a card or perform certain Special Abilities --discarding is free, however.  Some card abilities cost more than one Action Point (some cost more than two!).  Unused Action Points are passed on to the next player.<br/><br/>Icons appear on the cards and act to guide play --each card brings icons in play, and each card requires certain icons to be in play before it can be played.<br/><br/>There are numerous ways to lose the game.  Basically, any action that would put you into one of the Inactive Files (Known Dead, Presumed Dead, Asylum, Missing, Resigned, Inaccessible or Other) also puts you out of the game.  The only exception is the Reanimated file.  If you die and get reanimated, you can keep playing the game, but you will suffer certain restrictions, making &quot;winning&quot; more difficult.<br/><br/>",

        "description": "Caveat Emptor is vaguely real-estate themed, with the board depicting a 7x7 array of lots, divided into sections of different sizes and shapes.  Each lot is also marked with a Roman numeral from I-V.  Players have sets of cards with the same numbers - on each round every player selects a card to be auctioned, but these are all shuffled together so no one knows exactly what will be available.  The gimmicks are that the winner of each auction can choose any like-numbered lot to own, and that the winning bid goes to the person who played the card, but no one knows who that is until the auctions are over.<br/><br/>Each lot has an intrinsic value based on the size of the section it is in, the bigger the section the more valuable.  However, a player can double or triple the value of his or her lots in a section by owning a majority or all of them, which is of course easier to do in a small section.  When a section is full the lot values are put into accounts for each player - these accounts earn interest every round, and the players are allowed to add a certain amount of cash to them as well.  The interest can be significant but withdrawing money from the account before the end of the game is somewhat painful.<br/><br/>",

        "description": "Power of Two is an abstract board game in which each player has sixteen pieces and the point of the game is to add them all to the board. You start with two (or in some variations four) pieces and new pieces are added by moving your pieces adjacent to each other. However, there is a catch. Each piece has two &quot;lives&quot; and using a piece to bring another onto the board uses one of those lives. Therefore, the game has a unique &quot;two steps forward one step back&quot; feel. In your turn your move may cause your own pieces to be removed but you never capture your opponent's. However, you can leverage your opponent's pieces as you add yours and he does not expend a life doing so.<br/><br/>An alternate winning strategy is to cause your opponent to have no legal move and even if you do not accomplish this, a large part of the game consists of maximizing your own mobility at the expense of your opponent. As with many Kadon games, multiple variations are provided.<br/><br/>",

Players have to keep two pieces on a square otherwise they can be captured by the opponent and returned to the start, however unlike Backgammon, players miss a turn if they throw doubles with the dice and cannot place more than two pieces on a square. Pieces can be moved sideways, but each square moved is counted, so beware. This game requires strategy and the player who sends their opponent back to the start the most is more than likely to win.

        "description": "Nebula 19 is a combat-oriented space game which features a three-dimensional map and simultaneous movement and combat.<br/><br/>The map has a square grid with numbers along the X and Y axes, and each star and nebula has a number (numbers in the case of nebulae) which gives its position on the Z axis. Many numbered counters are provided to place with ships to show their Z-axis positions.<br/><br/>Two copies of the map are provided, allowing players in a two-player or team game to move their ship counters on the map simultaneously. After movement players compare their maps to determine which enemy ships are in range, and then write down firing and shield usage orders, which are again resolved simultaneously. Using weapons and shields costs energy, which must eventually be replenished at a home base or by borrowing from another ship.<br/><br/>Several levels of play are provided. The basic game is as described. The standard game adds several features - tracking (ships are placed face-down on the map and only revealed when successfully probed), hyperspace movement (conducted off-map), carrier ships, etc. The advanced game adds a few more features, notably supply points, and more importantly allows players to create their own ship designs (ships in the advanced game have 21 different components, allowing for considerably customization).<br/><br/>There are a few optional scenarios, including one which allows for up to four individual players (this requires either additional copies of the map, or some players to write down their moves). Four players can also play the standard and advanced game scenarios in teams, as the forces each contain two different groups of ships.<br/><br/>The original version of the game was published in 1971. A second, presumably revised version was published in 1977.<br/><br/>Nebula 19 was rated &quot;Best SF Space Tactical Game&quot; by The Space Gamer magazine's 1979 Game Survey.<br/><br/>",

        "description": "From the publisher's website:<br/><br/>During the middle years of the seventeenth century, the British Isles underwent a period of huge change, catastrophic wars and campaigns, political revolution, social upheaval political experimentation and religious ferment. It was a period when the famous and the infamous made their entries into the history books leaving their legacy and their legends. Names such as Ralph Hopton, William Waller, Prince Rupert, Thomas Fairfax, the Earl of Essex, the Earl of Newcastle, Owen Roe O&rsquo;Neill, The Earl of Montrose and Duke of Argyll can still evoke fierce loyalties and harsh criticism even today. The characters of those chief protagonists, King Charles I and Oliver Cromwell, are still considered, analyzed and argued over by successive generations of historians.<br/><br/>There is little surprise therefore that the English Civil War has always been a firm favorite for wargamers.<br/><br/>Polemos: English Civil War is unashamedly aimed at large scale actions. It is quite possible to stage, play and complete actions the size of Edgehill, Marston Moor and Naseby in an evening.<br/><br/>The basic playing piece in Polemos is the Base. An army is comprised of a number of Bases and can be built either using historical orders of battle or on Army Lists. Bases are generally grouped into Brigades. Armies can vary in size from around 15 to 50 Bases.<br/><br/>Polemos:ECW is designed to allow the player to represent an English Civil War army using a limited number of bases, each of which represents a tactical element that may act individually. Each base is designed to have enough figures on it to look like a real unit. The design focus eliminates fiddly lining up, precise numbers of figures of musketeers and pikemen etc in favour of a broader approach.<br/><br/>",

        "description": "Cripple Mr Onion was originally a fictional card game played by characters in Terry Pratchett's novels Wyrd Sisters and Witches Abroad. This was used by Dr Andrew Millard and Prof. Terry Tao as the basis for an actual card game. The complete rules and design of this game were posted on USENET around 1993. It contains elements of blackjack and poker.<br/><br/>The rules as posted on USENET were approved by Pratchett himself.<br/><br/>The most notable aspect of the game is that it requires an eight-suited card deck: a deck using the normal suits (clubs, hearts, spades, and diamonds) must be shuffled together with a deck using the Spanish (and Tarot) suits (staves, swords, cups, and coins) yielding a complete deck with eight suits.<br/><br/>Each player receives a hand of ten cards: five cards are dealt face-down to each player, and the player may then discard up to four of them, receiving new cards to replace them. Then a further five cards are dealt face-up to each player except the dealer, who receives his face-down. The first player begins by assembling his or her cards into one of the winning groupings described below, and displaying them. The next player must then create a more valuable grouping or fold. If the player is successful in creating a more valuable grouping, the original first player may try again to create an even more valuable grouping for themselves, or fold. This process passes left around the table until only one player remains, who then wins the hand.<br/><br/>",

Their tokens (plus same tokens in other colors representing items such as beer barrels and tow ropes) can be stacked below the airships in order to raise them above ground, which gives a good indication of who is on the winning path.<br/><br/>The game had extremely good manufactured components, oversized dice and playing cards printed on thick game board stock.

Each player rolls dice for his cyclists, cyclist who are in the wheel of another cyclist may follow without rolling a die, each time a cyclist stays in the slipstream he wins a chip. The maximum number of chips a player can win is 5. These chips can be used at any time to alter the result of a dice roll.<br/><br/>There are 2 different editions of this game that circulate around, the difference is in the colors of the cyclist's jerseys.<br/><br/>",

        "description": "Over the years, there have been numerous attempts to develop rules for three dimensional (3D) chess using  three standard 8 by 8 chess boards (3x8x8), however, many of these games suffered from major problems that distracted the players from the essential characteristics of traditional chess. Some of these 3D chess variations created new chess pieces while other 3D rules imposed mandatory or unusual moves. In addition, many of these &quot;rules&quot; were generally incomplete causing inconsistent interpretations. None of these game variations offered a truly playable chess game.<br/><br/>Because of the lack of playable rules, the Millennium 3D Chess rules were written with the objective of extending the traditional chess game into a multilevel environment without distorting the basic game. To this end, Millennium 3D Chess has not &quot;created&quot; new chess rules, but instead extended the traditional rules to allow for multi-board play. Other than the concept of moving between chess boards (levels), all traditional two (2D) chess rules apply.<br/><br/>",

Players move around the board trying to correctly answer questions so that they can earn chips from each area.  The chips are used to surpass obstacles along the way, and players can rearrange the obstacles on the game board.  The first player to reach the last square on the board wins.<br/><br/>There are several aspects of the game that make it family-friendly.  The first is that questions can be answered in multiple-choice style so that players can try to deduce the answer rather than having to know the fact directly.  The second is that there is a catch-up mechanism which boosts the player in last place so that they can compete more effectively.<br/><br/>",

The game was played using the board and components from a Backgammon set, however three six-sided dice were required. All fifteen checkers were used, except the starting position is different than in backgammon - each player places two checkers on their first point and thirteen checkers on the  sixth point from the opponent's side of the board. The object of the game is to be the first player to move all of your pieces off the board. However, there is a sudden death rule: if a player throws a number on a die which cannot be played, that player immediately loses. The three dice could be combined for a single move or used separately for three different moves.<br/><br/>",

The game is played on a 10&times;10 board<br/><br/>The Knight moves like a standard Chess Knight, with the added ability to step a single space horizontally or vertically. The Knight is still forced to move to a square of the opposite color with each move.<br/><br/>The Wizard piece is a color-bound leaper invented for Omega Chess. It can make a (1, 3) leap, or move a single space diagonally. Like a Bishop, the Wizard remains on squares of the same color throughout the game.<br/><br/>The Lion is a piece invented by Ralph Betza, which he called a Half-Duck. It has been used recently with the name 'Lion' in games by David Paulowich. This piece may leap either 2 or 3 squares horizontally or vertically, or may step a single space diagonally. This piece stays on squares of the same color except when it makes the somewhat awkward (0, 3) leap.<br/><br/>The Chancellor is a compound piece combining the moves of the Rook and the Orthodox Chess Knight. The Archbishop is a compound piece combining the moves of the Bishop and the Orthodox Chess Knight .<br/><br/>This material was gleaned from <a target='_blank' href=\"http://www.chessvariants.com\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer noopener\">www.chessvariants.com</a><br/><br/>",

The ships are in a weird dimension and their brake motors are not working. For this reason if a piece is moved, must move until stopped by an other piece or by the borders of the board. Players try to land their ships on the black hole. The ship landed on this square pass to another dimension and removed from the board.The ships can pass over the black hole, but for removing it must land on this square. The player who rescue first his/her two ships from this dimension win the game.<br/><br/>",

In Phase 1 you both try to improve your hands by bidding for new cards from the stock. When none remain in stock, you score for any melds (card combinations) contained in your revised hands. This phase is rather like Gops.<br/><br/>2. Tricks. In Phase 2 you play out your revised hands to 13 tricks, aiming especially to win an odd number of tricks (1, 3, 5 etc). This phase is rather like Piquet.<br/><br/>3. Play-off. Finally, you each pick up as a new hand the 13 cards you used for bidding in the first phase, and aim to be the first to play out all the cards from your hand. This phase is rather like Arsehole / President / Trouduc.<br/><br/>",

The game is designed to be played on a 7.5x5 foot table using miniature ships.

It is similar to, but differs a fair bit (scoring and key cards), from the card game known as Casino and another called &quot;Bazra&quot;.<br/><br/>The game uses a standard 52-card deck, without jokers. After an initial deal of five cards to each person (2-player only), two cards are turned up in the middle of the table. After playing one card at a time from the hand, another 5 cards are dealt to the players once their current hand is empty. Thus, each game segment lasts 5 rounds (10 cards per round + the initial 2 card outlay).<br/><br/>Points (always 5 per game segment) are given at the end of the deck for the following:<br/>Most cards = 2<br/>Most clubs = 1<br/>2 of clubs = 1<br/>10 of diamonds = 1<br/><br/>See the A new 2-player card game (for most of you) for a visual explanation of rules and scoring basics.<br/><br/>",

This attack behind enemy lines, was intended to unhinge the German fortified Gustav Line.<br/><br/>The Germans responded quickly, containing the beachhead. The fighting was bitter, with both sides suffering high casualties. Intense artillery bombardments, water filled trenches and muddy conditions, made this battlefield a wretched place. The Allies would be on their beachhead for four long months before they were able to breakout and meet up with the rest of U.S. 5th Army.<br/><br/>The game represents the first six weeks of this campaign. It was a period when both sides attacked each other vigorously, looking for opportunities to  break through the enemy defences, while desperately resisting enemy advances. By the beginning of March, both sides had fought each other to a standstill.<br/><br/>The Anzio rules bring differential based combat, single stacks attacking single stacks, Random Events, random strength Allied bombardments, historically based special abilities for some formations, anti tank values, bog checks for off road movement and disengagement tests when attempting to leave an enemy ZOC.<br/><br/>The presentation includes Large hexes and large counters to enhance the playing experience. The counters are provided on self adhesive paper and require the user to mount them onto card prior to cutting.<br/><br/>",

The tigers try to capture all goats, while the goats attempt to encircle the tigers and win.<br/><br/>The game starts with the goats off the board, and the tigers positioned at the apex and the two inner intersections closest to the apex.<br/><br/>Players take turns and move along the lines.<br/><br/>The player controlling the goats makes the first move by placing a goat in a free intersection. (Goats cannot move until all 15 have been placed on the board.)<br/><br/>The tiger can either move to an adjacent intersection along a line, or capture a goat by jumping over it just as in Checkers/Draughts. (Unlike goats, tigers can move right from the first turn.)<br/><br/>The game ends when all goats have been captured, or when none of the tigers can move.<br/><br/>NOTE:<br/>Only one goat can be captured at a time. The captured goat leaves the board.<br/>A tiger cannot be captured.<br/>Turns alternate between players, with the goats starting off the game.<br/><br/>Equipment:<br/>Goat: 15 small pieces. <br/>Tiger: 3 big pieces. <br/>Board with lines and 23 Spots for moving Aadu and Pulis.<br/><br/>",

Start by removing one random card from the deck (so that there is one rank that cannot form four-of-a-kind) and deal the remaining deck out between the players. On their turn, a player must discard 1-3 cards face down and announce those cards' rank (the same rank being called for the entire round, and players may lie about what they are discarding), or call the bluff of the previous player.  When a bluff is called, the played cards are revealed and the loser of the challenge draws the entire discard pile without showing the cards to anyone. After drawing the discard pile, a player may choose to discard sets of four-of-a-kind from their hand (in some versions of the game all must be discarded; in others, only a single set). The player to the left of the challenge loser starts the next round, naming a rank of their choice.<br/><br/>",

Yep.<br/>8 Seconds from Glory is a fun little game that's made for having a good time with friends, family and everyone in between. It's a game with a little luck (drawing the &quot;right&quot; Bull) and a little skill (knowing when to use your Ride Dice). But it's mostly about fun!<br/><br/>Will you play it week in and week out? Probably not but you'll be able to pull it out occasionally and play without learning how to  play all over again. It's simple. It's fun. You remember fun right? That's why you play games&quot;<br/><br/>8 Seconds from Glory is a very little and easy game that uses the simple throw of 2 dices to adjudicate the many situations the bull rider will face during his brief cavalcade. The result of the dice is confronted with compiled tables that will tell players the outcome of the phases, the dice is no way a blind roll. Every rider (and even the bulls!) have their characteristic and their traits, so a sparkle of role-playing game is gladly implemented, as are rules to make your rider or bull progress during rodeo seasons.<br/><br/>Very fun to play!<br/><br/>",

If another your miniature touches the ball, the previous miniature regains the maximum touches avalaibility. If you miss the ball, or this touches any of the other side's players, the ball possession passes to the adversary.

The cards are placed on the table to create the path on which the ice cubes will progress. Some cards make it possible to attack another player's ice cube &ndash; dipping it in a glass of cold water, warming it with your hand, blowing on it, putting a pinch of salt on it, etc. &ndash; to make it melt a little. Other cards allow you to defend yourself &ndash; well, your ice cube anyway &ndash; by preventing an attack. If your ice cube melts completely before the end of the game, you're eliminated.<br/><br/>The first player to bring his cube to the 25th card wins.<br/><br/>",

        "description": "Carousel is the overarching name for a series of prototypes that played around with the same core mechanic. The concept is simple: There is no good or bad card in the game.<br/><br/>Every card has every action on it, shuffled around a series of slots. On the center of the table there are several places, each with a number which matches one of the slots. The place in which your characters is defines the slot you can use on all your cards. You'll want to control that character to use your cards as best you can.<br/><br/>Once the base mechanics were set, the game went through several themes: Time travel, gangsters robbing a bank, delivering mail, delivering pizzas. It immediately made the game easier to learn since the players had a train of thought they could follow. The game adapted to each of the themes, and grew with it.<br/><br/>Its latest iteration is called Multiuniversum and is going to be published by Board &amp; Dice later this year!<br/><br/>",

This is a game for 2,3,4 or 6 players.<br/><br/>Game begins by dealing the 13 cards to the players, face down. The remaining one card will be placed face up on the table for all players to see. <br/>Each card has exactly the same points as its face value. King card has 13 points, Queen card 12, Jack card 11 and Ace card 1 point.<br/><br/>Players take turns exchanging any card from their hand with the one in the table to achieve the exact amount of points known as Target Points. Target Points for the game is calculated by multiplying cards in hand per player with 7. <br/>For example, for a 3 player game, cards per player will be 4. So Target Points to achieve will be 7 * 4 = 28.<br/><br/>A player with his total card value equal to Target Points wins the game immediately and is removed from the game. (A player cannot win if he exceeds the Target Points.) The game continues till one player remains.<br/><br/>",

GOAL<br/>The goal of the game is to be the first one to play all dice away from your cup.<br/><br/>2. GAME TERMS<br/>Value: the value of the numbers on a die from low to high is 2-3-4-5-6-1.<br/>Joker: number 1 on the die is the joker and can be considered to be any number from 1 to 6. A thrown number 1 can also be played as a 1, in which case it is valued higher than a 6. This applies to all game modes of THINKABOXIN.<br/>Bid: a gamble or bluff on the total amount of dice of a certain value that are underneath all players&rsquo; dice cups (including one&rsquo;s own cup).<br/>Raise: raising a bid means that EITHER the amount of dice is raised (e.g. raising four twos to five twos, etc.) OR that the value of the aforementioned amount of dice is raised (raising three fives to three sixes or three ones) OR that both are raised (raising five fours to seven sixes, etc.).<br/>Lift: the player who calls a bid into question, lifts his own dice cup. Afterwards, all players (including the player whose bid had been called into question) lift their cups in order to check who is right through counting the amount of dice with the value named in the last bid.<br/>Won dice: after each round all players &ndash; except the player who was not right &ndash; can get one die out of their dice cups and put it away.  The amount of dice put away is called won dice. Only the dice that can be put away from one&rsquo;s own cup count as won dice. <br/>Round: one played round (ends when the winning players have been able to put away one die).<br/>Set: all played and counted rounds.<br/><br/>3. GENERAL GAME RULES THINKABOXIN<br/>&bull; Before the start of the game, each player always receives a personal dice cup containing 4 dice.<br/>&bull; All players simultaneously shake their cups with dice, and each player looks underneath his own cup to see what he has thrown himself.<br/>&bull; Players may not ever see one another&rsquo;s dice (except for when cups are lifted).<br/>&bull; The youngest player starts the very first round. The rounds after that, the loser of the previous round or set begins bidding.<br/>&bull; Whoever starts a round always determines the playing direction. The player determines this through making a bid to either the player to the left or right of him.<br/>&bull; A bid that has been placed cannot be withdrawn or changed.<br/>&bull; Once a bid has been placed, the turn of whoever placed the bid is over, and the next player&rsquo;s turn is at hand.<br/>&bull; The next player either raises this bid in the given playing direction or lifts his cup if he takes the current bid into question.<br/>&bull; Raise: raising a bid means that EITHER the amount of dice is raised (e.g. raising four twos to five twos, etc.) OR that the value of the aforementioned amount of dice is raised (raising three fives to three sixes or three ones) OR that both are raised (raising five fours to seven sixes, etc.).<br/>&bull; Raising a bid has to be done in the given playing direction.<br/>&bull; In case of a raise, the previous bid no longer needs to be kept in mind.<br/>&bull; When someone lifts the cup to indicate that he takes the previous player&rsquo;s bid into question, this action is final and cannot be undone.<br/>&bull; When the bid has been taken into question and one cup has been lifted, all players should then lift their cups, and the dice with the values named in the last bid will be counted.<br/>&bull; When more than or precisely the amount of dice named in the bid are present, the bidder is right and the lifter is not right.<br/>&bull; When fewer than the amount of dice named in the bid are present, the bidder is not right and the lifter is right.<br/>&bull; Whoever is not right is not allowed to get any die out of his cup, all other players are allowed to get one die out of their cups.<br/>&bull; The won dice that have been put away from the cups have to be placed in front of the dice cups on the table in a way that is visible for all players.<br/>&bull; The player who was not right starts the next round and can determine once again the playing direction through placing a bid in the desired direction. <br/>&bull; The player(s) who manages to be the first to place all the dice from his cup in front of him on the table wins the set.<br/>&bull; If dice roll out of one or more players&rsquo; cups or dice end up lying on top of one another, then these players are The Donkey. This means that all other players can get one die out of their cups. Afterwards, all players shake their cups and the bidding can be started anew by the one (or those) that is (or are) The Donkey.<br/>GAME TERM: KNOCK-OUT RACE<br/>Unlike stated under the GENERAL GAME RULES THINKABOXIN, a knock-out race does not stop when one or more players have played away all their dice from their cups. During a knock-out race, a round will continue until there is one loser left. This loser will be eliminated from the game and barred from further participation to this part. The next set will continue with the remaining players, and the last but one loser starts the round. This will go on until one winner remains.<br/><br/>4. GENERAL TIPS AND TRICKS THINKABOXIN<br/>&bull; At all times, keep an eye on how many dice are in the game at the start of each round. At the start of a 4-player game, 4 x 4 dice = 16 dice are lying underneath the cups. The lowest possible bid is in this case 1 die with value 2 (one two) and the highest possible bid 16 dice with value 1 (sixteen ones).<br/>&bull; It could be useful for the player whose turn is at hand to base his bid on his own dice. True bluffers do not do this. They do not care about which dice they have, and wildly undertake hit-or-miss bids. These unpredictable players give the game an extra dimension. <br/>&bull; Determining the playing direction upon doing the first bid of a round can create a tactical advantage when placing a calculated and sharp bid towards the player who is ahead of the rest of the players.<br/>&bull; When there are 2 dice remaining in the game and these are both ones, the player who at that moment would bid &lsquo;two ones&rsquo; wins, rather than the player who would bid &lsquo;two sixes&rsquo;. The joker is namely also the highest value on a die. In this specific case, both players should of course both have a 1 underneath their dice cups.<br/><br/>5. GAME MODES<br/>Nuggets<br/><br/>&bull; The GENERAL GAME RULES THINKABOXIN apply to NUGGETS.<br/>&bull; Each player receives 10 nuggets before the start of the game.<br/>&bull; Each player shakes his dice in the cup, and the first player of each set can, after checking the dice underneath his cup, determine what the stake for each player will be for this set.<br/>&bull; This stake is either 2 or 4 nuggets.<br/>&bull; All other players will then place the same amount of nuggets as their stake.<br/>&bull; If one or more players do not have any remaining nuggets and are out of the game, the stake for the other remaining players will always be the total amount of nuggets of the player with the lowest supply of nuggets. In that case, the stake could be more than 4 nuggets.<br/>&bull; When a player has no remaining nuggets to put in as stake, the game is over for this player and he can no longer play.<br/>&bull; The pool of nuggets will only be distributed when one or more players have played away all their dice from their cups.<br/>&bull; When there are multiple winners, the pool of nuggets is to be distributed fairly between them.<br/>&bull; Any possible remainder of nuggets will stay in the pool for the next set. When two players win with an uneven amount of nuggets in the pool, the remainder will stay in the pool for the next set.<br/>&bull; The player who has won all nuggets is the winner of NUGGETS.<br/><br/>Goldrush<br/><br/>&bull; The GENERAL GAME RULES THINKABOXIN apply to GOLDRUSH.<br/>&bull; One player (the secretary) fills in the players&rsquo; names (in sitting order) and keeps the score for each round on the score notepad.<br/>&bull; 10 rounds are played in total.<br/>1st set = 1 round, everyone starts with 1 die in their cups.<br/>2nd and 3rd set = 2 sets, everyone starts with 2 dice in their cups.<br/>4th until 6th set = 3 sets, everyone starts with 3 dice in their cups.<br/>7th until 10th set = 4 sets, everyone starts with 4 dice in their cups.<br/>&bull; A set is won when one or more players have played away all of their dice from their cups. At that point, all won dice for each player are counted and noted under the players&rsquo; names for the relevant set.<br/>&bull; The running scores are continually counted by the secretary and announced to the other players.<br/>&bull; The final score is announced by the secretary, declaring who the (tied) player numbers 1 and 2 are.<br/>&bull; The (tied) player numbers 1 and 2 are pitted against one another in a final knock-out-race.<br/>&bull; The winner of this final is the winner of GOLDRUSH.<br/><br/>The Next Sheriff<br/><br/>&bull; The GENERAL GAME RULES THINKABOXIN apply to THE NEXT SHERIFF.<br/>&bull; During the entire game one-on-one duels are played. Each player duels one another once, until one of the players has played away all of his dice.<br/>&bull; One player (the secretary) fills in the players&rsquo; names from left to right and, in the same order, from top to bottom. The secretary also keeps the score for each duel (the amount of won dice per player) on the score notepad.<br/>&bull; The secretary determines at what time which player plays against which player.<br/>&bull; The amount of dice that have been put away from the cup is the amount of scored points. This result is noted directly after each duel by the secretary.<br/>&bull; After all players have played against one another once, the total amount of won dice is counted and noted in the totals column on the right-hand side (Total amount of won dice).<br/>&bull; The score from the totals column is filled in at the lower section (in case two players have a tied score, the winner is defined as that player who beat the other player in a duel). The resulting tournament schedule works in the following way:<br/>With 3 players: no. 1 directly granted place in finals. No. 2 plays against no. 3 for place in finals.<br/>With 4 players: no. 1 plays against no. 4 for place in finals. No. 2 plays against no. 3 for place in finals.<br/>With 5 players: no. 1 directly granted place in finals. Winner of no. 2 against no. 5 plays against winner of no. 3 against no. 4 for place in finals.<br/>With 6 players: no. 1 plays against no. 6 for place in finals. Winner of no. 2 against no. 5 plays against winner of no. 3 against no. 4 for place in finals.<br/>&bull; The winner of the last finals is the winner of THE NEXT SHERIFF.<br/><br/>Last Man Standing<br/><br/>&bull; The GENERAL GAME RULES THINKABOXIN apply to LAST MAN STANDING.<br/>&bull; A knock-out race is being played during the entire game (see explanation KNOCK-OUT RACE).<br/>&bull; One player (the secretary) fills in the players&rsquo; names and notes during each set which player has been eliminated and crosses that player&rsquo;s name out on the score notepad.<br/>&bull; The winner of the knock-out race is the Last Man Standing.<br/><br/>Rattlesnakes<br/><br/>&bull; The goal of this game is to be the first to place all your snake parts (20) on the game board.<br/>&bull; RATTLESNAKES is played on the RATTLESNAKES game board with 20 snake parts per player.<br/>&bull; The GENERAL GAME RULES THINKABOXIN apply to RATTLESNAKES.<br/>&bull; Each player receives 20 snake parts before the start of RATTLESNAKES.<br/>&bull; The amount of snake parts that can be placed on the board per set is determined by the amount of dice won by the player per set.<br/>&bull; After a played set, the player with the fewest won dice is the first to start placing his snake. In case of an equal amount of won dice, the player who was the last to lose can start placing. He also determines in which direction the other players are allowed to place their snake parts.<br/>&bull; If a player, for example, has won 3 dice in a set, he can then place 3 snake parts on the game board. Afterwards, it is the next player&rsquo;s turn to place his snake parts.<br/>&bull; A snake always begins from one of six snake head squares on the game board, which can be freely chosen by the players.<br/>&bull; Only the first snake part placed by the player can be put on a &lsquo;snake head&rsquo; square. Afterwards, no snake parts can be put on a &lsquo;snake head&rsquo; square.<br/>&bull; Each square on the game board can be used only once.<br/>&bull; The snake parts that have not been placed yet must be placed in front of you in a way that is visible to all players, so that it is at all times clear which player is ahead or behind on the rest (this can influence the tactics of placing snake parts).<br/>&bull; Placing snake parts on the game board can be done in any desired direction via an adjacent square.<br/>&bull; The final snake part that is placed (the head) in a set is placed (temporarily) upright, so that it is clear from which square the snake slithers onwards into the next set.<br/>&bull; When crossing your own snake (through removing one snake part after winning a set with 4 won dice), the crossed part becomes the head (no extra snake part is therefore placed).<br/>&bull; When snake parts can be placed anew, the snake head is laid flat and it is from this square that new parts must be placed.<br/>&bull; The next round will be started by the player who was allowed to place his snake parts the first in the previous set. He once again determines the playing direction through placing his bid to either the left or right (note: a tactical advantage can be gained through this action).<br/>&bull; Once a player has chosen to go into a snake pit by having a snake part stand on an orange square, that player is then obliged to let his next snake part appear at another snake pit on an orange square.<br/>&bull; It is forbidden to immediately re-use an already used snake pit. When going out of a snake pit, the snake has to slither ahead on the regular squares. Players can, however, use multiple different snake pits within one game.<br/>&bull; NO snake parts are placed on a snake pit, as snake pits only serve as a passage to and from another snake pit.<br/>&bull; When winning a set (all dice are out of the dice cup) the player (or players) has the following options:<br/>EITHER place 4 snake parts,<br/>OR remove 1 snake part of your own,<br/>OR remove 1 adjacent snake part of your opponent (this snake part is then given back to the player in question). However, this cannot be done to a snake belonging to a player who has also won this set with 4 dice.<br/>&bull; The player who is the first to put his entire snake on the board wins RATTLESNAKES!<br/>&bull; Should multiple players manage to put their entire snakes on the board within one set, a final round is organised for these players in the form of a knock-out race (see explanation KNOCK-OUT RACE).<br/><br/>",

But there&rsquo;s a balance of risk and reward. Plyters decide how many dice to throw to try and get ahead, and when it comes to it, who they will push back or help.  It starts off gently to let you get the feel of it but as the play gets closer to the end, positions can change quickly and the result isn&rsquo;t certain until the very last throw!<br/><br/>But Plyt isn&rsquo;t just about beating your opponents &ndash; it&rsquo;s also about challenging yourself &ndash; pushing yourself out of your comfort zone and feeling the buzz of getting it right!<br/>There are lots of different playing options you can choose (all described in the rules and on the website) &ndash; it all depends how competitive you want the game to be and how long you want it to last.  The basic game normally lasts between 25-45 minutes but you can make this shorter or longer &ndash; it&rsquo;s up to you!<br/><br/>Come Forth and Multiply!<br/><br/>",

        "description": "The creators of numerous successful Kickstarters, including Four Tribes and Dig Down Dwarf, bring you a new blind bidding and deck-building dungeon delving card game. Of Dungeons Deep! is a fusion of many mechanics and was inspired by such games as Smash Up!, Dungeon Raiders, Cutthroat Caverns, and Friday and is set in an amazingly illustrated world that is whimsical, with just a touch of darkness. Of Dungeons Deep! takes a brave new look at a classic theme, is easy to learn, and employs simultaneous play which equates to almost zero downtime for players!<br/><br/>We are proud to announce that ALL the artwork for Of Dungeons Deep! has been commissioned by the fabulous Derek Bacon. Mr. Bacon has worked on such titles as Tower, Baldrick's Tomb, and Smash Monster Rampage. His style is both playful and edgy, and we feel it is the perfect match for the game. Plus his name is BACON so.....<br/><br/>Bluffing and Blind Bidding. Players are attempting to destroy the nasty creatures below in the dungeon to gain fame by playing cards face down and revealing simultaneously. Each enemy has a set number of hit points based on the number of players. There are three enemies to deal with in each level of the dungeon, so strategy, tactics, and bluffing are a must. There is also two rounds of bidding so players gain insight into what other players are up to.<br/><br/>Deck Building. When a player defeats an enemy, that card is rotated 180 degrees and then added to the player's discard pile. The bottom of each monster card indicates what item the enemy is carrying. These items add power to your character in future rounds, and act as an organic and thematic way to show that your characters are advancing.<br/><br/>Draft Your Unique Party. Before play begins, players complete a draft in order to create their starting hand of twelve cards. Each player gets one Hero and one Henchman. All characters are very unique and play quite differently from one another. This sets the bar high for replay value!<br/><br/>No Down Time! Since all play is done simultaneously, no players are ever waiting on others for very long. This makes Of Dungeons Deep! one of the fastest dungeon delvers out there.<br/><br/>",

        "description": "Ragnaroll is a game of glory, death and dice. A great winter has descended upon the land, the sun has disappeared, the sea has frozen over, there's no more crops or cattle and all you have left is a few winter stores and, of course, your fluid Viking sense of ownership.<br/><br/>In Ragnaroll, you control a band of Viking warriors, each represented by a custom die, struggling to survive. Your band consists of a unique hero, 2 soldiers, 1 shieldmaiden and a loyal, but slightly unreliable, dog. You'll need to fight to protect your precious food stores, as well as raid your opponents for glory and more food. It's a harsh winter wasteland, and the last Viking alive wins, unless of course Ragnaroll happens first.<br/><br/>A round of Ragnaroll starts by revealing an event card, which will provide some incentives and rewards for your Vikings to leave their comfy halls. Next, players secretly separate their warriors into their defenders and their raiders. Players reveal their selection simultaneously and the boldest and bravest player, the one with the smallest raiding party, seizes the Initiative, gaining control of raid order for the round. If there's any ties, you'll need to literally seize the initiative by grabbing the initiative token from the centre of the table.<br/><br/>In the order of the Initiative holders choice, each player conducts a little bit of Norse business, pitting your raiders against your opponents defenders and using your defenders to protect your stores from your enemy&rsquo;s raiders. Battle is resolved through rolling dice and using special battle abilities fuelled by glory. Each hero has a unique set of powers that will enable them to turn luck into fate. Each player, starting with the raider, will use a battle ability, and then the winner will be determined. Whoever has the most axes win, but you'll be able to block axes with shields and appeal to Odin to reroll results. The winner of the battle will get to steal stores or slay his opponent's warriors, but each player will also gain glory. In addition to glory provided through the event for the round, every hero has a different path to glory, some will delight in crushing their enemies, while others will be satisfied with survival and some may even gain glory through defeat.<br/><br/>After all players have raided, they will return to their falls and feed their warriors, but with stores running low, not all mouths are worth feeding. You can send any of your Vikings out into the snow for a long walk, saving precious resources, and if you get really desperate, you can even eat the dog. After you&rsquo;ve fed, you&rsquo;ll draw a new event card and start all over again. The game will end in one of 3 ways, each of which show the gods that one band of warriors is fit to fight alongside them in Ragnaroll. When there&rsquo;s only one player with Vikings left, that player wins, demonstrating they have the strength and cunning to fight with the gods, but if all players run out of stores at the same time, you will all conduct one last glorious battle and the player with the most axes will emerge victorious. However, if any player is able to demonstrate they are truly worthy of the god&rsquo;s favour by gaining 15 glory, they will immediately win and take their rightful place in Valhalla.<br/><br/>Ragnarol is a game where your choices matter. You&rsquo;ll need to balance risk and rewards, and manage your precious, dwindling resources, making hard decisions for the survival of your clan. The dice-based combat doesn&rsquo;t simply mean that your fate into the hands of the gods, as you&rsquo;ll be able to influence the outcome of the battle using your glory-fueled powers, but you&rsquo;ll need to choose the battles that are worth the cost.<br/><br/>",

The game supports 3-8 players, and plays in about 10 minutes.<br/><br/>The dealer shuffles the deck of cards (one per player in the game), and deals one, in turn, to each player, calling out the card each time. Once both the &quot;Goose&quot; and &quot;Caboose&quot; cards are in play, these player race to call out the other players names, going clockwise around the table. The winner scores a point. The cards are shuffled and the game continues until someone scores three points.<br/><br/>But wait! There's more! The &quot;Goose&quot; and &quot;Caboose&quot; players can get tripped up and have to start over if they don't say the names right, or if they don't call the other racing player &quot;Doug&quot;. Everyone else is in charge with keeping the racing players honest.<br/><br/>",

In this tile laying style card game, players race to collect the 20 pizza scoring tokens by completing as many pizzas as possible. But beware the ingredients&rsquo; &ldquo;wicked&rdquo; special abilities and spell cards that will create havoc if they become activated. When the final scoring token is taken, the game ends and the scores are tallied.<br/><br/>On your turn, you will play either a pizza or spell card from your hand and then draw back up to 3 cards at the end of your turn. The 55 pizza cards have a variety of different layouts with quarter and half slices on them. In order to play a pizza card, it must be laid adjacent to another card already in play and must connect crusts with another card in play if possible. When 4 sections of pizza come together to complete a pizza, 1 or 2 points are scored depending on the number of ingredients that make up that pizza; pizza scoring tokens tokens are immediately claimed. If the pizza is made up of 3 or 4 of the same ingredient, that ingredient's special ability is activated. There are three copies of 4 different spell cards that allow for additional cards to be drawn, pizza cards to be played from the discard pile, add scoring to a non-ability activating pizza, and play a half pizza section of your choice.<br/><br/>There are also 4 bonus scoring cards, each showing 1 ingredient, that have two abilities: 1) worth 3 points if in possession of a player at the end of the game 2) have a half pizza slice on one side that can be played onto the board instead of playing a card from a player's hand. In order to claim these cards, a player must create a pizza that is made up entirely of 1 ingredient. When that happens, that player takes the card and places it in front of them. The card stays there until either the player uses the half pizza or the game ends. However, if another player creates the same type of pizza, they steal it from whoever has it.<br/><br/>",

Oh snap!<br/><br/><br/>Working together with Tim Buckley, Killer Robot Games is proud to present Legendary Showdown: Gamer's Quest.<br/><br/>You don't need to be familiar with Ctrl+Alt+Del to enjoy Legendary Showdown.<br/><br/>In Legendary Showdown: Gamer's Quest each player uses strategy, sabotage, and one-upmanship to develop a secret battle plan.<br/><br/>In Legendary Showdown, each player controls a line of characters. At the end of the round, the characters at the front of each line fight. Players use cards to rearrange their line and the lines of other players to change which characters will compete. Characters can be strengthened (or sabotaged) with special bonuses, weapons, and secret facedown cards. Action cards can be used to employ numerous strategies and keep your opponents guessing. The round suddenly ends when enough players pass, and the strongest front character wins the round!  All of the other front characters are discarded, and the last player standing wins.<br/><br/>",

On a player's turn, the player rolls &quot;bug dice,&quot; which determine what cells on the grid are eligible for a stone placement. A player then places a single stone of his/her color into one of these cells; once placed, stones never move.<br/><br/>When the board is full or both players pass, chains of stones in each color will have been made.  Players count how many flowers each chain of theirs touches.  The player with the chain that touches the most flowers wins.  In case of a tie, players compare their second-highest-scoring chains, and so on, until the tie is broken.  Draws are impossible.<br/><br/>",

The Iban-People, known and feared for their head hunting and piracy, and James Brooke, an English adventurer and vassal of the sultan of Brunei, who recently became the ruler of Sarawak.<br/><br/>In this strategy game 2 players wrangle with their dice for the predominance in different areas, which are represented by cards. In 4 battles are fought three areas each.<br/><br/>Alternately, the counterparties put dice with different values on the cards. But the waters off the coast are treacherous, so the dice change their positions and valence again and again. Anyone who holds the majority on one card after the betting of all the dices, assures the supremacy in this area.<br/><br/>Only those who are planning ahead, take advantage of the water's vagaries, and use their limited resources clever, will claim the rule in Sarawak.<br/><br/>",

Then players must select a Means, Motive and Opportunity from cards in their hand. They then use these elements to tell the story of how the killer did the deed. Preferably this is delivered in the style of a Detective in the third act, revealing to the audience and assembled cast just how clever they were to figure it out. The stories are cross examined and picked for holes by the other players, before the Judge settles on the best, using whatever criteria they prefer.<br/>Noir is packed with a grim cast of Femme Fatales, gum shoe P.I.s, mean Mobsters and hardened Hit Men. The play throws up stories which are by turns dark, hilarious, inventive and always, always memorable. <br/>At the bitter end the best denouement of the game wins!<br/><br/>",

        "description": "Brabble is a simple but interesting word game that includes bluffing, based on traditional student word games.<br/><br/>The players consecutively add letters (from a small selection) to one of three frames, creating words that include the framed letters in the same order...or do they? Because you can add a letter without knowing a word that actually contains the created fragment. As long as the next player doesn't challenge the fragment, you are safe. Players score a point for successfully adding the last letter that fits into a frame and for winning a challenge.<br/><br/>The challenge: Choose one of the frames and ask the previous player to name a word that contains the respective fragment (in the exact order of the letters). If they can, they win a point; if not, you do.<br/><br/>The game ends in a &quot;best of three&quot;, which means that whoever scores the second point wins.<br/><br/>",

The fish card a character holds shows a number which determines how many cards they can play in the second phase, the action phase. In this phase, players try to cheat the other players out of their catch. Over the course of the game, players try to protect their catch and cheat others out of theirs.

Deliver goods to your customers but watch out for the cops and rival dealers. They&rsquo;ll try to take you down as you negotiate, bribe, and scheme your way to the top. Make the most money before time&rsquo;s up, and you win!<br/><br/>The board is your block. To move forward, you&rsquo;ll move your game piece around the sidewalk clockwise. You&rsquo;ll also find a road that the cops drive on, a jail in the middle of the board, and apartments where you will deliver drugs. Your game piece moves based on the white die and the Cop Car moves based on the black die. The person who most recently did drugs goes first.<br/><br/>There are four drugs in the game: Weed, Molly, Coke, and Shrooms. Before the game begins, you&rsquo;ll select one type of drug. There are four Suppliers on the board &mdash; one for each type of drug. Suppliers sell you drugs, which you&rsquo;ll then sell at a higher price to your Clients for a profit. Each player has one Supplier from which they buy their designated drug exclusively. You can buy baggies of your designated drug for $10 each from your Supplier every time you land on, or pass over, your Supplier&rsquo;s tile. You may buy as much as you can afford.<br/><br/>You&rsquo;ll receive a Text Message card every time you land on or pass over, a notification tile. There are two types - those from Clients who would like to buy drugs (this will include which drugs they want, how many baggies, and which apartment to deliver them to), and those from Informants who give you advantages throughout the game.<br/><br/>To sell drugs:<br/><br/>     Pass over, or land on, your Client&rsquo;s apartment (indicated by their Text Message).<br/>     Burn Text Message card.<br/>     Discard sold drugs to the box.<br/>     Pick up $50 per drug sold from the box.<br/><br/><br/>There is a Cop Car that travels around the board trying to bust dealers. If at any point, you have possession of drugs and the Cop Car lands on the adjacent tile to your game piece, you&rsquo;ll go to Jail. (You will only be arrested if you&rsquo;re in possession of drugs.)<br/><br/>There are two ways to avoid being arrested:<br/><br/>     Bribe the Cops with $50. (The money should be put back into the box.)<br/>     Blackmail the cops with an appropriate Text Message from an Informant.<br/><br/><br/>If you go to Jail, you must discard all of your drugs and weapons. To get out, you must complete a loop around the Jail with your game piece.<br/><br/>If on your turn, you land on a tile shared by another dealer&rsquo;s game piece, you have the option to rob your friend, potentially stealing their drugs. Both players roll one die (the number you roll represents your Attack Strength), and the highest Attack Strength wins.<br/><br/>On your turn, you may buy weapons - Brass Knuckles, a Switchblade, and/or a Pistol. Weapons increase your Attack Strength during a robbery. You can continue to use your weapons until they&rsquo;re confiscated by the police.<br/><br/>You can also buy an Associate. Associates follow you around the board, allowing you to increase your attack strength during a robbery and increase your movement around the board by +1.<br/><br/>On their respective turns, players may trade Text Messages, drugs, weapons, or cash. There are no rules around trading &mdash; all is fair in love and drugs. If, at any point, you run out of cash, you&rsquo;re out.<br/><br/>When time is up, each player is given one last turn, starting with the first player of the game. When the last player completes their turn, each dealer should count how much cash they have. If you have a weapon, or unsold drug baggies, you may liquidate them for the price you paid.

Cicera is played mainly in the province of Brescia (northern Italy). Cicera is a traditional game, with many local variants and an unspecific origin, so there isn't a standard set of rules, but there are many local or familiar differences, though the core rules are always the same.<br/>To be able to play this game the specific deck of cards of brescia, which consist of 52 card (and not 40, as its common in other italian decks). The available cards are king, knight, knave, 10, 9,8,7, 6, 5, 4, 3, 2, ace(1). It's also possible to play with a standard french/international deck (taking out the jokers).<br/><br/>Preparation and goal:<br/>You play with four players (but there is also a 2 player variant), in pairs, two against two, each sitting in front of his partner. Every player has an hand of 12 cards, the remaining 4 cards are put face up on the middle of the table. The dealer is initially chosen at random, but after each hand, the dealer turn passes to the person who is at his left hand (clockwise).<br/>The first pair that reaches 51 (sometimes 41, 31 or 21) or more points at the end of the game wins. If both pairs reach 51 in the same hand the highest score wins.<br/><br/>The game: <br/>The player to dealer's left plays first, and continue until you play all the cards in the players's hands. <br/>A turn consists of playing one card from their hand on the table, face-up, and clearly visible, which can take (or not take) one or more cards placed on the table itself. <br/>If the value of the card played matches that of a card (or a sum of cards) placed on the table, the cards on the table can be taken and put face down in front of you, to be scored at the end of the game. <br/>The numeric cards from 1 to 10 have a value equal to the value of the card itself and can take 1 card of the same value or more than 1 card, but the sum of these cards must have a value equal to the played card.<br/>The faces (king, knight, knave) can take only another card of the same face. <br/>You can choose freely the card to play, you are also free to choose to take card(s) or not, and you can also choose which cards to take, as long as the values match.<br/>After playing all the cards, the last player who has taken cards also takes all the cards remaining on the table.<br/><br/>The scoring system:<br/>At the end of the game the players of a couple put together their own cards. <br/>There are 6 points that are always assigned, each to one or the other player or pair, regardless of the conduct of the game (the so-called &quot;Honours&quot;). <br/>All the other points may or may not be assigned depending on the progress of the game. <br/>Cards (2 points): The pair that takes more than half of the cards gets 2 points, in case of a tie (26 to 26) every pair gets one point.<br/>Swords (1 point): The pair that takes more than half (7) of the cards of the swords gain 1 point.<br/>Good cards (1 point for card): The 2 of swords, the knave of cups and the ten of coins are worth 1 point each.<br/>Neapolitan(or Naples): If a couple takes the ace, two and three of swords, they get a number of points equal to the highest card of the swords captured which is present in an unbroken sequence of cards of swords: for example, if you made the following outlets: A-2-3-4-5 and 7 of swords, the score will be 5 because 5 is the highest card of the sequence uninterrupted.<br/><br/>You can also score points during the rounds (traditionally you keep track of this point by placing a face up card in front of you, while the card taken are normally face down):<br/><br/>Scopa (Broom): You realize 1 point when you leave the middle of the table empty of cards. <br/>Picchiata (Hit) or Surprise: You realize 1 point for Hit if you play a card of the same value just played by the previous player (and take the two cards of the same value).<br/>Similar: It produces 1 point if the card played and taken are all of the same suit and if their number is more than 3.<br/>Quadrille: You realize 1 point for a quadrille if you play a card that takes a group of three or more cards (not necessarily of the same suit) from the table.<br/><br/>&mdash;user summary<br/><br/>",

To do so, you need to place fireworks cards on your side of the river to complete your program cards while attempting to earn the applause of each &quot;yakatabune&quot; &mdash; that is, &quot;houseboat&quot; &mdash; card by having a majority in that column.<br/><br/>In more detail, to set up lay out the seven yakatabune cards in a row; place three starter fireworks (value 1) on the starting player's side of the board and four starters on the other side in alternating columns. You start with two cards in hand from your deck of 13 cards, and you choose two program cards from the three you're dealt.<br/><br/>On a turn, play a fireworks card on your side of the board in the closest empty space next to a yakatabune on your choice. Your opponent may then use the effect of that fireworks card &mdash; swapping two cards, shifting a card to an adjacent space, or flipping a card &mdash; on either their cards, your cards, or the yakatabune, depending on the icons depicted on the associated yakatabune. Alternatively, your opponent may decline to use the effect and instead draw a program card.<br/><br/>After you play a card, if you have a program card in hand that matches the pattern of fireworks on your side of the board, you can play that card, take the bonus actions on it to shift one or more of your cards, then play another program card if you now have that pattern.<br/><br/>Next, if the number of cards surrounding a yakatabune equals or exceeds that boat's limit, you sum the fireworks on each side to see who has captured the awe of the viewers on that boat. Mark this boat with an applause token, then turn all of the winning player's fireworks face down. (Face-down cards can still be used to complete many pattern cards.) End your turn by drawing a fireworks card from your deck.<br/><br/>When the game ends after five applause tokens have been placed or the fireworks or program cards run out, players tally their collected awe to see who wins.<br/><br/>&bull;&bull;&bull;<br/><br/>YAKATABUNEは、2人用のパズルとマジョリティのゲームです。<br/>プレイヤーは花火師となり、注目を集めている花火大会でライバルとどちらが優れた花火師かを競います。<br/>自分のエリアに花火カードを配置し、演目カードに描かれたレイアウトを達成しながら<br/>屋形船カードのマジョリティを競います。<br/><br/>",

The trading mechanisms are supported by a bluffing mechanism in which players can lie about the cards they are trading.<br/><br/>Each player starts with seven cards from the twelve types in the game. Each turn, a player draws two additional cards, then tries to negotiate trades, e.g., &quot;I can trade Day drinking and Online, for company and distraction.&quot; After a successful deal, players trade the cards secretly. When trading, players can lie about the cards they are offering, except the first card that they offer. Players can additionally add Loo rolls as sweeteners for the trade. If a player collects three cards in the same category, they must play this set for points.<br/><br/>The game ends when six COVID-19 cards are drawn, then all played sets are scored. Black cards in your sets (good events) are worth 2 points, loo rolls are 1 point, and red cards and unplayed cards are 0 points.<br/><br/>",

Each card has 4 silly words on each side, so each player will have 16 words to play with.<br/>All players must combine one word on each of their cards to form a new slang phrase and arrange it face up in front of them. (They cannot combine two words on the same card).<br/>Once everyone is ready, each player must introduce their new slang phrase and tell the Mint Master what it means.<br/>Scoring<br/><br/>After each player has defined their word, the Mint Master awards 1 Mint to their favorite new slang phrase, plus:<br/><br/>1 bonus Mint if that player used alliteration (two words with the same first letter, such as Boof Bucket) AND<br/>1 bonus Mint if that player used a rhyme (such as Poot Boot).<br/>The winner of the round may win anywhere from 1-3 mints based on their slang phrase.<br/><br/>Round End<br/><br/>Once the winner is chosen, all of the used cards are discarded, the Mint Master passes the tin clockwise, and you go back to the start. Re-shuffle as needed.<br/>Play continues until the tin runs out of mints, and the person with the most mints wins. (If the tin has less mints then the last winner is owed, that winner gets &lsquo;em all).<br/>Try to incorporate your new favorite slang phrases into your everyday life!<br/><br/>&mdash;description from the publisher<br/><br/>",

Cards are shuffled and dealt evenly to all players.<br/><br/>You win the centre pile by slapping down on the following scenarios - Good Food Card &ndash; Trio of Seagulls in a Row &ndash; Two Ice Cream Seagulls. However, there are various Bad Food Cards and special cards in the pack to which if slapped on, that player must forfeit 3 cards to the centre pile.<br/> Special cards like the Pirate Seagull have been added, whereby once lain, all players must shout Parlay and the last player to do so, forfeits 3 cards to the centre pile.<br/><br/>If the Mob Card is lain, that player can shout mob before the next player lays their card and claim 5 cards from any player. <br/>This game can be played for 1 minute or 15 minutes, it all depends on how good you are at spotting the difference between the cards.<br/><br/>&mdash;description from the publisher<br/><br/>",

        "description": "Shortly after Poland was conquered in 1939, Hitler begin urging an immediate attack in the West. The original plans were uninspiring and his generals feared an attritional stalemate. Over the winter the Germans keep taking the measure of their opponents and hit upon a plan was that inspired, risky, and utterly decisive. Ironic of Hitler to assume his remarkable success was simply the new template for all future campaigns. His eyes turned east.<br/><br/>But why, exactly, did France fall? Against the Odds 2017 Annual  features four top designers all tasked with re-examining the 1940 campaign and answering that very question.<br/><br/>The Seeds of Disaster is a game about how events of the 1930s affected World War II, most especially the German invasion <br/>of the West in 1940. This game connects a war campaign with  the military preparations, intelligence developments, and  diplomacy that preceded it. It is an attempt to represent a  piece of history as interconnected with other historical developments. This is a two-player game in which one player takes the Germans and the other the Western Allies, including <br/>France, Great Britain, Belgium, and Holland. Victory is determined by control of Mobilization Center and Objective Areas at the end of the last turn of play.<br/><br/>In broad outline, what you see here is a game that is multi-dimensional and coupled. The initial phase of play creates a game history of the 1930s to generate the concrete situation for the German invasion of the West in 1940. By intertwining fresh dimensions of Intelligence and Command, the game creates new ways in which the 1940 situation can be distinctive from <br/>one play of the game to the next. The invasion campaign is the culmination of the game. With this partially scripted history, <br/>how does the war progress? The geography will be the same, the deployment of the forces may be similar, but the details of <br/>the forces and their Intelligence and Command postures can be very different.<br/><br/>",

        "description": "Bardo (&quot;Flame War&quot;) is a real-life app where we will talk about EVERYTHING! The chat got heated. Display the menu of viral topics: everyone has their opinion and the fight is starting. We can make a big deal, make a mess or talk nonsense, know what we are talking about or not have a clue. All's fair in this game. Get ready for trolling in the group by playing your best cards.<br/><br/>Objective: Follow the conversation and discard the most Bardo cards throughout the game rounds. The winner is whoever runs out of cards first, or who has the least amount at the end of 3 rounds.<br/><br/>Deal 7 Bardo cards to each player. Put cellphone camera spots (Bardo cards background) on the table according to the number of players, to mark how many Bardo cards will be played each round. Choose a viral theme to talk about, from the menu or select one yourself.<br/><br/>A player starts playing one of their cards on a Bardo spot, and talking about the theme relating it to the Bardo card (by theme, feelings, or any way is valid). Words in the table cannot be mentioned, and a card would be taken as penalization if done. The player can be interrupted by other after 5 seconds or when they finish the idea. The interrupting player plays a new Bardo card, and has to answer or discuss the previous speech.<br/><br/>When all spots are covered, the round ends. The played cards are shuffled in the deck, and a vote is made (except on the last round) to penalize the most incongruent player on the round, with each player receiving an additional card for each vote they received against them.<br/><br/>The winner is whoever runs out of cards first, or who has the least amount at the end of 3 rounds.<br/><br/>",

By laying down and replacing the 9 Pathway tiles on the board, you control your troops' laser to shoot down enemy fleets and establish safe encampments for back-ups. The side that first strikes the enemy Home Planet will claim victory!<br/><br/>Players place place or remove tiles on the centre board, or exchange one for another from hand.<br/><br/>The game ends and you win when the enemy Planet Tile (like the King in chess) is removed from the board.

In Britain in particular, 'plant hunters' brought back bulbs, seeds and sometimes even seedlings of native species from Asia, Africa and the Americas, which were then propagated, crossbred and adapted to the cold climate by gardeners back home. This seemingly impossible project was supported by a flood of funding from patrons, mainly royalty, aristocrats and wealthy families.<br/><br/>In Age of Flora, flowers are everything. You are a flower buyer, so you need to collect as many flowers as possible before your competitors do. The sooner you reach seven flowers in your possession, the sooner you will receive a contract to deliver them to the noblemen's mansions - which will naturally have magnificent gardens. However, you cannot buy all the flowers. The market is limited in size and the varieties that should be delivered to the 'Royal Gardens' are not easily accessible!<br/><br/>In Age of Flora, players aim to collect 7 different flower saplings the fastest! However, if you wait too long for flowers to accumulate, the market may fill up go bust! Or the Royal family may swoop in an buy the flowers from under your nose.<br/><br/>",

Over the course of three years, they work to balance each student's needs, provide encouragement, and help them graduate.  Should one instructor ever find themselves a bit overwhelmed, they can call on their co-workers for a helping hand.<br/><br/>After choosing from one of the four classes, players receive the corresponding event chart, seat number deck, and student cards.  The students are shuffled and randomly placed in a 3x4 grid, which forms the seating chart for the room.  Then seat number cards are drawn to determine the initial placement of power and negative markers.<br/><br/>Play proceeds through a series of lesson rounds, both group and individual ones.  Instructors try to balance encouragement and enthusiasm via the movement of power markers while slowing or outright eliminating the stress and frustration from the negative markers.  Should a student ever accumulate enough stress, they can spread it to others around them or even become absent.<br/><br/>At the close of three years, students are subject to a final exam.  After that, those that are absent or lack at least one power marker fail to graduate.  Teachers are then provided with a title and evaluation based on their work.  If too many students fail to pass, all the instructors are also seen as failures and lose.<br/><br/>",

The coal pot, a bucket for transporting coal, is also used to explain the name.<br/><br/>But one thing is certain: everything revolves around mining and no other region in Germany is as typical, as diverse and as colorful as the Ruhr area.<br/><br/>Let's do a quick brainstorming session. What comes to mind? Mines, allotment gardens, dovecotes, drinking halls, mixed bags, football, bratwurst, beer, Gr&ouml;nemeyer, Schimanski, Opel Manta, culture and multiculturalism. Who can add more terms?<br/><br/>Of course, there are also many tensions and problems: the change in the pot is far from complete. But no matter which corner you come from, the Pott is home.<br/><br/>What could be better than winning the pot playfully in a friendly atmosphere? The main thing here is not to leave the playing field as the richest, but rather to have fun!<br/><br/>Let's quickly go to the drinking hall and get a mixed bag for a snack. Tackle? A tacken was the ten pfennig piece and in return you got sweet treats. Don't you know anything anymore? The grandparents can certainly tell a few anecdotes.<br/><br/>The game is reminiscent of Monopoly. However, the cards to be purchased do not have a fixed price but must be purchased using a bidding mechanism. There is also the possibility of shortening half the game board using a special route that runs across the board (the A40 motorway).<br/><br/>Mining history, traditions, people born on coal and with steel in their veins!<br/>Who invests with the right instinct and relies on the fastest carrier pigeon? Good luck!<br/><br/>",

        "description": "Game description from the publisher:<br/><br/>Scratch Wars is close to a collectible game, but in certain game modes it's closer to a board game and can be also played online through a phone application for iOS and Android.<br/><br/>In more detail, to start playing Scratch Wars you need only two cards: one hero and one weapon. The cards are unique in several aspects. You can scratch them like lottery tickets, but by doing so you are not destroying or devaluing them. Each hero card is unique; each hero has a unique name and value generated. No one else in the world will have the same card! Slowly uncover the card by scratching it and in combination with unique values, it is pleasantly thrilling. Cards can even be bought individually. (Would you rather have a hero or a weapon?)<br/><br/>With an increasing number of weapon cards, you can try a sophisticated one-on-one duel in which you equip your hero with up to five weapons, then think strategically to find out which one to use when. The duel itself is very interesting; you spin a special circular weapon: turntable paper on a stick. The hero has certain levels of energy which you spend using various weapons. Heroes can change weapons during the turn and their proper use is the focus of the game. The game is risk management; you are trying to spend the hero's energy for the best possible effects. According to the composition of effects, you choose weapon, strategy and risk. You can attack the opponent's weapon, his permanent effects, or the hero directly. You have to decide when to repair a weapon, when to save energy for the hit with more powerful weapons, etc.<br/><br/>Once you get into the basic game, you can try a more comprehensive and strategic mode in which teams of heroes compete against each other. Then you can move to the top mode where entire armies of heroes collide. With more than two players, it is possible to play in teams or each player plays by themselves with modified rules. The game is perfect for tournaments.<br/><br/>If you want to play with just one player, simply scan the card into your phone and you can play online. There is a varied range of options at your disposal, from tournaments and hero trainings to territorial fights. The goal is to level your hero up and obtain spells for him. As the first game in the world, Scratch Wars presents digital ownership so that what you have physically, you also have digitally. If you later want to replace or sell any of your heroes, you can change them digitally with all that is recorded on the card, i.e., with all the spells and experiences.<br/><br/>If you would rather play the game more as a board game and add more strategic options, you will be able to expand the game with &quot;trade&quot; cards or hero's &quot;abilities&quot;.<br/><br/>",

The problem is that now that we know, the other races know as well. Thus, the beginning of the timestreams invasion is now taking place, during which entire races invade the parallel timestreams.  These invasions cause temporal distortions, causing a dimensional vortex that may cause one race or more to be so distorted that it will be impossible to interact with anything from a three dimensional universe.<br/><br/>Timestreams is a game where players alternate turns and try to wreak havoc for their opponents. All players start with their player card next to a timestream, and during the game they try to avoid being in the same timestream with another players.<br/><br/>Sometimes, a player must calculate a temporal distortion, and all players that are on the same timestream as another must lose an amount of this distortion by counting on their vortex resonator. The winner is the last race standing, after everyone else's race has reached its critical point.  There is no player elimination.  Players will continue to play until the end of the game and take their vengeance on the opponents that took them out.<br/><br/>",

The value of the numbers of the dice does not affect the result.<br/><br/>Explanation of the symbols of the special die:<br/>The side which has two dice drawn on it permits the player to change the number on 1 or 2 of the the 3 dice thrown to match the number showing one of the other die.<br/><br/>The side which has one die drawn on it permits the player to change the number of one of the dice thrown to match the number on one of the other two dice thrown.<br/><br/>The symbol of the 2 half circles with arrow heads allows the user to interchange the position of two dice already placed by him on the board with a view to ending up with a group of dice with the same numbers and, even better, of the same color as well.<br/><br/>The symbol of the 3 small squares with a divided arrow coming from middle one allows the player to change the number on a die which has already been placed on the board or which the player is about to place on the board, to any other number.<br/><br/>The Flying Turtle is the super bonus. It allows the player to do all the moves which are permitted by the other symbols on the special die.  Further more, when placed in the center of the board it increases the players points considerably.<br/><br/><br/>3. Once the player's throw has been adjusted to take into account the special die, the player places his dice in the zone or zones of his choice.  He will in so doing try to fill the empty spaces in a circle with dice with the same numbers and if possible, of the same color.<br/><br/>End of the game:<br/>The player who has the highest score after 5 turns wins.<br/><br/>",

That's still the name for a hand which has one of every suit, a hand which has gone bust.<br/><br/>There are several Terrapin games that use the same rules for ranking hands but different rules for betting.<br/><br/><br/>     Rules at the Decktet Homepage<br/><br/><br/>",

        "description": "Dunsany's Chess was developed by Irish author Lord Dunsany in 1942. It is an asymmetrical chess variant. One side has a standard chess army, while the other has 32 pawns. The side with a full army wins by capturing all opposing pawns. The side with the pawns wins by checkmating the King. Another variant known as Horde Chess adds four extra pawns to the side with only pawns.<br/><br/>In addition to offering a unique puzzle, Dunsany's Chess is good for teaching chess, since one player can observe the moves of the pieces while needing only to remember how to make pawn moves.<br/><br/>",

        "description": "Battle Roll is a 2 player dueling dice game! It's quick, addictive, portable, and loads of fun! It comes with eight beautiful precision engraved and painted dice with incredible detail. It only takes about 5-10 minutes to play, making this a great game to pull out in an airport, waiting room, or anywhere else! Because of the short game length it's also great for using in a tournament scenario with groups of people. Don't let the game length and portability fool you into thinking that there isn't a lot of depth or variety in playing Battle Roll. The outcomes are nearly endless! A game could range from a complete blow-out, to a neck-and-neck down to the last roll, sudden death victory! It all depends on how the dice fall! Battle Roll is really fun to play, but it also looks cool! The combination of  custom polyhedral dice and acrylic life-stones are sure to attract attention and questions like &quot;What are you playing?&quot; It all fits nicely into a custom zippered pouch making it easy for Battle Rollers on the go to sneak in a quick game wherever they are.<br/><br/>",

        "description": "(now available as Isla Tetra 2 - please check BGG page)<br/><br/>The first game from Will Sargent's Solway Games uses a colourful new puzzle system to create essential inventory items which can be used to explore the mysterious island, ISLA TETRA.<br/><br/>The same colourful grids are built to earn Exploration, Health and Fishing actions, making for a puzzling castaway adventure of the like never seen before.<br/><br/>You might think you can get by simply walking the sun-kissed sands, soaking up the sun, but leave your island escape plan too late and you'll find events back home have taken a turn for the worse: As the months tick by, the search for your crashed plane is eventually called off, your job is readvertised, and your car has been sold to keep up with the bills. After two years of waiting, your family holds a memorial service and your partner is now returning to a social life as a single person. You might be a great survivor, but at what cost?<br/><br/>Each turn players can beachcomb for useful items such as rope, old bits of wire and driftwood. You might even find a pilot's hat or laminated crash instructions washed up from the azure, salty brine. These pieces of flotsam and jetsam are shown on 52 professionally printed cards and represented by brightly coloured, chunky 3D shapes which can be linked neatly together on your individual player mat to build items essential for survival.<br/><br/>Players must strike a balance between plundering the island&rsquo;s resources for points while ensuring they&rsquo;re not last off the island. Finish too low down on the time-track and you'll accrue penalty points which could rob you of victory.<br/><br/>It's all about strategy, and fun puzzle solving. Some of your inventory items can only be built using a single colour, while others allow two or all three. Also, some grids are larger than others, taking longer to build, some are small and awkward to fit all the available shapes into.<br/><br/>Upgrades can give you more playing power, such as extra card swaps and extra jokers; longer explore moves; greater fish catches. Which to go for first? It's up to you to try the many different combinations.<br/><br/>To start, you are only allowed to build two items at a time so think carefully... whittle away by the fire at base camp, or set out deep into the island in search of vines and timber to help strengthen your small raft, ready for the final ordeal across raging seas...<br/><br/>source: from publisher: Solway Games<br/><br/>",

        "description": "The World&rsquo;s First Open Source Quantum Board Game. Master New Galaxies in Your Quest to Construct a Quantum Computer!<br/><br/>Welcome to the Quantum Universe, Captain!<br/><br/>Congratulations, your captain has retired and left you in charge of his galactic shipping business! Now it&rsquo;s time to make some upgrades as you embark on a journey to reconstruct a quantum computer developed by an ancient race.<br/><br/>Entanglion is a cooperative board game designed for two players. Learn about quantum computing as you work together with your teammate to navigate the three galaxies of the quantum universe, avoid detection by the defense mechanisms left behind by the ancients, and rebuild the quantum computer.<br/><br/>Think you&rsquo;re up for the challenge?<br/><br/>Goal<br/>Entanglion is a cooperative board game designed for two players. The goal is to reconstruct a quantum computer developed by an ancient race. Work together with your teammate to navigate the three galaxies of the quantum universe &ndash; Centarious, Superious, and Entanglion &ndash; in a quest to collect eight quantum computer components. Be careful to avoid detection by the planetary defense mechanisms guarding the components!<br/><br/>Game concepts<br/>Entanglion was designed to expose players to several fundamental concepts in quantum computing:<br/><br/><br/>     Qubits are the building blocks of quantum computation.<br/>     Superposition is when a quantum system may exist in a probabilistic combination of multiple states at once.<br/>     Entanglement happens when the state of one qubit correlates with the state of another qubit.<br/>     Measurement is the process of observing the classical value of a qubit.<br/>     Error happens when random noise in the quantum system perturbs the measured value of a qubit.<br/><br/><br/>Entanglion also exposes players to the different kinds of hardware and software components involved in building a real quantum computer.<br/><br/>Turn overview<br/>Perform one of the following actions on your turn.<br/><br/><br/>     Navigate. Play one engine card in engine control to navigate around the galaxy, and draw a replacement. You may only play engine cards for your own ship.<br/>     Exchange. Discard one engine card from your hand and draw a replacement..<br/>     Retrieve. Roll the Entanglion die to attempt to retrieve a quantum component if one is present.<br/>     Event. Play an event card from your hand (if you possess one).<br/><br/><br/>Players may not pass their turns, they must perform one of the actions above.<br/><br/>Detection rate<br/>The detection rate determines the difficulty of successfully evading planetary defenses. The detection rate token is used to keep track of the current detection rate. When a player&rsquo;s spaceship has been detected by orbital defenses, or a player&rsquo;s away team has been detected by ground defenses, the detection rate is increased, making it easier for each planet&rsquo;s defenses to detect the player in the future. The game ends when the detection rate reaches the final level (designated with an X).<br/><br/>Orbital defenses<br/>Planets in Entanglion are protected by orbital defenses that scan for ships looking to plunder the quantum components hidden there. It is possible to evade these defenses using your quantum engines. If you are detected, however, your navigation system will automatically take evasive maneuvers and jump to a random planet in the Centarious system. This jump triggers a quantum event.<br/><br/>Game end<br/>Players immediately win the game when they have collected all eight components of the quantum computer. Players immediately lose the game when the detection rate reaches the end (X).<br/><br/>",

The aim of the game is to gather 4 people from one of the 13 sets: the military, astronomers, etc&hellip;<br/>When the player gathers the 4 cards they secretly signal their partner who then says EUREKA.<br/><br/>Moving forward...<br/><br/>1. At the beginning of each round, turn 4 cards over (from the deck) on the table. <br/>2. All together, players count up to 3. <br/>3. After finishing the count, each player can switch the cards held in the hand with the ones on the table (he/she can switch as many cards as desired). <br/>4. A round ends when players do not wish to exchange more cards. <br/>5. The 4 cards on the table from the previous round are discarded. Turn 4 new cards over from the deck and repeat the procedures from step 2 forward.<br/><br/>- FAMILY GAME (GAME 2)<br/><br/>OBJECTIVE<br/>Gather as many Families as possible. Each Family is composed of 4 characters. Each character is associated to a colour: green, red, yellow and blue.<br/><br/>Moving on&hellip;<br/><br/>Step 1<br/><br/>The first player asks another player for a card of his/ her choice. This request must respect the following rules:<br/><br/>     the player already has a card of this Family;<br/>     the player must always say: first, the name of the Family to which the card belongs; then, the colour associated with the desired character: green, red, yellow or blue.<br/><br/><br/>Step 2<br/><br/>One of the following options occurs:<br/><br/><br/>     if the player succeeds in getting the asked card: then, he/ she asks a player for a new card;<br/>     if the player cannot get the asked card: he/ she picks up a playing card from the deck placed on the centre of the table and stops playing. It is the next player&rsquo;s turn.<br/><br/><br/>",

Place the matching bunny card on the table next to each wooden rabbit.<br/><br/>On a turn, deal each player a track card, then on the count of three, reveal these cards.

Each player then advances the rabbit token that matches their card a number of spaces equal to the number of footprints showing on their card. If you find your rabbit on a side of the chest that's not guarded by a chicken, you can now grab an egg! (This is symbolized by you turning your track card face down and keeping it.)<br/><br/>Play through the track card deck, and see who collects the most eggs!<br/><br/>",

When playing with this variant, each player starts with one of these extra tiles in hand. To win the game, a player's dream companion tile must be in the center space of the dreamscape, in addition to all other normal goal requirements. This makes for a fun extra challenge!<br/><br/>About the base game:<br/><br/>Dingo and his friends have gotten lost on Walkabout! Visit their dreams to lead them home!<br/><br/>Dingo's Dreams is a delightful and clever family game for 2-4 players. Each player competes to be the first to successfully guide his animal through the dream world.<br/><br/>Each player starts with a grid of 25 tiles, set up at random in a 5x5 dreamscape. Each player also starts with one extra tile, with a picture of their animal on it. The opposite side of all dreamscape tiles also has a picture of the animal. Each turn, a random card is drawn, telling players which tile they should flip. When a player flips a tile, it means their animal is traveling through a part of the dreamscape. Each player's goal is to guide their animal through the dreamscape by positioning him in a specified pattern (which is different each game). After a card is drawn, a player takes their extra animal and slides him into the dreamscape, shifting one row or column of tiles until a new, different tile emerges from the opposite side. The player will use this tile to shift another column or row on the next turn, and so on, until one player's dreamscape tiles match the goal. The player then shouts their animal's name-- &quot;Dingo!&quot;, for example, to win the round.<br/><br/>Advanced rules add Hazard Tokens which increase the challenge substantially: to complete the required dream pattern, the player may not have his animal in any of the Hazard spaces marked on the dream card.<br/><br/>",

Two of the advancing Union armies in the Western Theater hadn't yet converged. The Confederates thus perceived a rare opportunity to concentrate against Grant's six divisions at Pittsburg Landing on the west bank of the Tennessee River. Organized into four corps, Gen. Albert Sidney Johnston marched his men 20 miles from Corinth, Mississippi, toward the Federal troops bivouacked along a skirmish line extending from the bank of the Tennessee River to the small &quot;Shiloh&quot; church inland.<br/><br/>Shiloh utilizes an all-new Musket &amp; Saber combat system, which provides a simple yet accurate portrayal of warfare during the American Civil War. The combat system is intuitive, including all of the details that characterized battle during the Civil War, while also simulating the unique aspects of 19th century warfare. Units can become weakened and rout; attackers can pursue, and the fortunes of war can intervene at any time. Cavalry can rip open enemy lines and shred fleeing units, and reserves must be ready to plug holes or secure the line of retreat.<br/><br/>A new Combat Results Table emphasizes playability while also simulating the lethality of the rifled musket . Leaders accelerate the action, replicating the importance of their presence during battle. Supply lines forcing players to protect their logistical trains. Winning a battle will depend on deployment, maneuver and massing firepower, as well as understanding the strengths and weaknesses of each particular army.<br/><br/>Re-implements:<br/><br/>    Shiloh: The Battle for Tennessee, 6-7 April, 1862<br/><br/><br/>",

The game is played in rounds, each round the players produce goods which they try to exchange for goods produced by the other players. Only goods which have been exchanged this way can then be sold for victory points. The exchange value of goods depends from supply and demand and will change from round to round.<br/><br/>The game Black market has won the 3rd price at the Hippodice game designer contest 2003 as Merkantilismus. There are some small changes to this version.<br/><br/>Black Market will be published during the Essen convention 2008 as a small (110 copies) handmade game.<br/><br/>",

The Game Counters are Dark BLUE with WHITE print for the FRENCH, and Dark GREEN with WHITE print for the RUSSIANS. The Game Charts are Light GREEN with BLACK print FRONT and BACK with one of them having the Terrain Effects/Combat Results while the other has the TURN Record Track/Initial-Set-Up/Unit-Types/Unit-Designations-&amp;-Sizes; and the sturdy RULES Booklet Cover with overall Dark BLUE and WHITE/BLACK print at about (4)-FULL Page sheets within.<br/><br/>The RULES are paper sheets folded in half, per page, with small print on both sides while an extensive Introduction on the Battle and detailed Orders of Battle are also provided. There are some Game Charts/Tables in the RULES Booklet such as the Bridge Bombardment Table, Morale Check Table, and Range Effects Chart. The Game Scale is 400-yards across a HEX, EACH Turn represents 30-Minutes, and Units are Regiments/Brigades/Divisions with Headquarters for FRENCH Army Command(Napoleon), plus the (4)Corps Commanders under him and RUSSIAN Army Command(Benningsen), plus the (3)Corps Commanders under him.<br/><br/>The Game-Turn Sequence is as follows:-1.French Movement Phase &amp; Reinforcement Entry; 2.French Combat Phase; 3.Russian Movement Phase &amp; Reserve Forces Release die-rolls; 4.Russian Combat Phase; 5.Turn Record Track marker advance. The Game begins at 8-A.M. and lasts until 8-P.M. at the latest or when one side or the other is destroyed or resigns.<br/><br/>There are Special Rules for the Commanders &amp; their Control(Command Range) over their Units, the Russian Reserves, Guard Units(BONUS 1-HEX additional RANGE) on both sides, Artillery RANGE(up to 5 hexes &amp; DOUBLED Strength at 1-HEX distance), Bridges(can be Damaged/Unusable and Repaired later OR Destroyed), Demoralization-in this game BOTH sides can suffer from THIS, and Breakdown of Larger Units into several smaller ones. The Combat Results Table uses (2)-DICE and even includes a ROUT result(Units affected are Eliminated and Victorious Units can Advance their FULL movement) while ROUTED Units COUNT for Demoralization but NOT Victory Points determination, a SKIRMISH result which enables the DEFENDER to counter-attack at 1-1 OR RETREAT-1 &amp; Attacker Advance-1 as well as others standard in a game such as this. The RAVINE hexsides incur a HUGE movement penalty in order to cross them PLUS Zones of Control do NOT extend across them. Overall, a very nice depiction of this Napoleonic Battle resulting from the pursuit of the Russians after the debacle at Eylau in that earlier encounter, and preventing them from linking up in full force, with the Prussians.<br/><br/>",

The Federalist player assumes the role of the commander of the People&rsquo;s Army of Yugoslavia (JNA), the only Federal institution still working in Yugoslavia in the early 1990s (the Federalist player must fight low morale, politicos, and the Separatists to keep Yugoslavia united, or at least to retain the largest possible tract of Serb-inhabited territory). The Separatist player represents the governments of the breakaway republics of Slovenia and Croatia fighting for independence and a free market economy.<br/><br/>",

On a players turn they must draw a card, complete a step if possible or play off cards from their hand onto their own or other players steps if they have their target step &quot;down&quot;, and discard a card to end their turn.  If player discards a playable card, another player may call &quot;rummy&quot;, play the card from the discard, and give the discarding player a card from their own hand.  A hand of play ends when any player discards the last card from their hand.<br/><br/>Players score points for cards remaining in their hands at the end of each hand of play.  After completing all 14 steps, the player with the lowest score wins.<br/><br/>Game includes 143 card deck (featuring unsuited number cards from 1 to 13 and &quot;Wild Bee&quot; wild cards), a set of four unique sliding windowed step counters that allow each player to keep track of which of the 14 steps he or she is trying to &quot;get down&quot; next, and a large pad of score sheets.  Cards are linen finished and seem to be of high quality.  Box top is sturdy.  Inner box, with game rules printed on bottom, is somewhat flimsy.<br/><br/>",

Players are trying to 'plan a route across China that would score the most number of points'.<br/><br/>In reality, the game can be thought of as a modified '10 days' game (with a scoring system, double-use cards as well as an 'interrupt' function).<br/><br/>The game: Players set up 12 cards on wooden card holders (similar to the 10 days, albeit bigger). The difference is that cards can be rearranged AT ANY TIME (making for a shorter game).<br/><br/>During a turn, the player draws a card and chooses to replace a card in their holder. The replaced card is put face up in the middle of the table. Subsequent cards are placed on the same pile.<br/><br/>Interrupts: if a discarded card allows them to complete a set of 3 connecting cards, a player can interrupt and take the card. A die roll resolves simultaneous interrupts. The set of 3 cards are revealed to other players and LOCKED from changes. Play continues to the left of the player who successfully interrupted play.<br/><br/>The game ends when a player connects up 12 cards (9 cards for a short game). Each player then tallies up VPs printed on cards, choosing between one of two cards in each link. Completing player gets 5 VPs bonus. Tranport cards = 0 vp. Multiples cards are -1 point for one after the main card.<br/><br/>The production values are high. The garish board is mounted, the rules and player aids are printed on thick laminated card, the wooden card holders add considerable heft to the box.<br/><br/>",

All players start with one of eight characters (Knight, Barbarian, Archer, Thief, Mage, Healer, Druid, Necromancer) on a beginning tile.  As the game progresses the dungeon is extended by adding tiles consisting of corridors, rooms, and importantly shops and most importantly the exit tile.  Shops allow the player to buy new equipment for their character, increasing his or her abilities, or heal damage from the dangers of the dungeon. Players themselves add monsters, traps and treasure within the dungeon to either their advantage or opponents disadvantage, leaving everybody to play.  Death in the game is only final if the exit appears, extending the overall player interaction to the last possible moment.  And don't worry, if a character exits the dungeon, the player may still play, using the dungeon and its inhabitants to stop other players exiting and defeating them.<br/><br/>",

The availability of goods cubes is very tight.<br/><br/>From the introduction:<br/>The Isle of Wight, off the south coast of England, was popularised as a holiday destination by Queen Victoria, who regularly spent summers at Osborne House, near East Cowes. In order to handle the increasing numbers of visitors, the first railways on the island, between Cowes and Newport, and between Ryde and Shanklin, opened in the 1860s. By the turn of the century there were 55 miles of track on an island that measures little more than 20 miles by 12.<br/><br/>",

Originally published in 2015, a new colour edition was made in 2016.<br/><br/>Long ago in a desert country, the Twin Princes decided to race for the right to the throne in a mutually agreeable method, in order not to cause a future struggle because of themselves.<br/><br/>Twin Princes is a card game for two players. There are six territory cards on the table, and players try to control them by placing influence cards on them. Each player also controls a Prince meeple, which move on the territories and affect the placement of cards.<br/><br/>A game consists of six round. Each round, five cards are drawn. One player (divider) split them into two groups, and the other (selector) takes one of these groups. The divider takes the rest. Then they take turns playing a card on a territory.<br/><br/>After sixth round, for each territory, count influence points each player has place on that territory. The player with highest influence controls the territory and scores victory points.

Divide these cards into two sets, such as 2 and 3, or 1 and 4, and add magic carpet cards to make a total of 4 cards.<br/><br/>The other player chooses one of the two decks of cards and proceeds to lay out the cards while revealing each other's hands.<br/><br/>If you make one card too strong, your opponent will naturally take that combination, so it is necessary to distribute it in a well-balanced manner. How to sort is very important.<br/><br/>Your hand information is always open to the public, so you'll have to think about which card to place in which area, and you'll be faced with a variety of choices when it comes to not only distributing cards but also placing them. This is the biggest attraction of this game.<br/><br/>The rules themselves are difficult enough for anyone to understand after playing it once, so if you have many opportunities to play board games with two people, this is a board game we recommend you play once!<br/><br/>",

Companies<br/>in each industrial sector generate income or losses, and grant players abilities that can be used during the game. As players build their business empire, they will also gain or lose Trophies depending on their presence in each sector and whether they dominate it.<br/>When a player holds a set number of Trophies the game ends immediately, and that player is declared the winner.<br/><br/>During the game, each player found or raid companies in different sectors of Orcs industry: Tourism, Smuggling, Totemology etc.<br/><br/>The game board consists of 10 sectors that assembles randomly for each new game. That gives a good replay rating as sectors will have different value and will affect on each other.<br/><br/>Companies in different sectors provide a special ability of the sector. For example, a leader of a Totemology sector will get an ability to send a crisis to an opponents sector. That also gives a variety of tactic decisions.<br/><br/>Another important part of the game - Influence Cards. It is hard to get it, but these cards are really powerful and can destroy your opponents plans and becomes even more devastating in various combos with sector abilities.<br/><br/>Finally, the main concept of the game lays in the interaction of all player. It makes a player to be involved in the gaming process even during the opponent's turn.<br/><br/>",

If there is only one player with the correct tokens, that player takes all the cards played this round.<br/><br/>Taking the correct token:<br/><br/>Cards show a definite animal. <br/>If in the round most of animals were herbivores, the herbivore token would be a winning token this time. Likewise with carnivorous. If there was a tie, neither herbivore nor carnivorous token would be winner.<br/><br/>Another winning token can be the tame (dog) / wild (crocodile) token, depending on the most of this condition among the cards played this round. If there was a tie, neither tame nor wild token would be winner.<br/><br/>In case a player takes a incorrect token, this player will lose two cards (if the player can).<br/><br/>Finishing the round:<br/>All the tokens are returned in the middle of the table and another round is played. The countdown will be made by the next player (that one on the left from the before first player).<br/><br/>Finishing the game:<br/>When there are no cards to play a round, the game ends.<br/>That one who has more cards at the end of the game will win the game.<br/><br/>Components: <br/>55 cards, 5 wooden tokens and rulebook.<br/><br/>",

Now you can participate in historical or what-if missions and aerial combats of WWII.<br/><br/>Kamikaze 1946: Divine Wind accurately recreates the speed and deadliness of air-to-air combat in a fast moving game system. Based on historical combat results, aircraft characteristics, and tactics of the aces, the simple rules are easy to follow. Most missions can be completed in 1-2 hours, with 2-8 players. Each player can easily control a dozen or more aircraft. The rules and data you need are contained within, along with information on painting 1/300th scale aircraft from Luftwaffe 1946 Miniatures. Can you alter the path of history?<br/><br/>&mdash;description from the publisher<br/><br/>",

        "description": "In Pilgrims, a trick-taking card game with a number of twists, players are collecting groups of villagers to go on pilgrimage together, but only the most impressive bands of pilgrims get to be commissioned by the bishop and gain prestige!<br/><br/>In each round, two (or sometimes one) sites of pilgrimage are on offer, and players try to build the most impressive band of pilgrims by playing cards of the same suit. Lower value cards may be used to provide relics or manuscripts to add to the prestige gained from visiting a particular holy site. You may even be able to go on pilgrimage on your own as the hermit!<br/><br/>When you go on pilgrimage, you receive a scoring card and discard all the cards you played. Players going home discard only one of the cards they played. Scoring cards give you 5-10 victory points, and there are chances to add to these using lower-value cards you play.<br/><br/>The more you go on pilgrimage, the smaller your band of followers becomes, making it more difficult to compete against your opponents, so you need to choose when to admit defeat and go home early in the hope of attracting more impressive followers to your cause.<br/><br/>The game is over when thirty pilgrimages have taken place, which typically means 16-20 rounds of play.<br/><br/>This game has been in development since 2004, and now is in final stages of refining the artwork.<br/><br/>-description from designer<br/><br/>",

In each of the 16 intersections between four spaces, there is a post holding a door that can swing around so that it blocks access between any adjacent two spaces of the four spaces around it.  Each player has five balls on his side of the board.  The object is to move the balls across the board, at which point they are removed from the game.  To move, you must push a ball through a door.  If there is a ball in the space beyond the door, it will be pushed -- this can cascade indefinitely.  But a move is only legal as long as each ball lands either in an empty space or goes through another door -- balls cannot touch each other.  The winner is either the first person to remove all his balls from the board, or the player with the fewest balls left when no legal moves remain.<br/><br/>",

        "description": "A Union invasion of northern Arkansas ground to a halt in early 1862 due to logistical difficulties. The alarmed Confederates sent Earl Van Dorn to coordinate the fractious Southern forces to repel the Yankee invaders. Van Dorn, aggressive but careless, launched a quick offensive that nearly trapped Sam Curtis&rsquo; Union Army of the Southwest, until Curtis extricated his army and placed it in a well-entrenched position on the plateau of Pea Ridge. After their rapid march north, the Confederates were exhausted and out of supplies, but Van Dorn nevertheless set them on a grueling night march around Curtis&rsquo; position.<br/><br/>Pea Ridge uses the Musket &amp; Saber system to accurately portray warfare during the American Civil War. All the primary facets of the muzzle-loading era are included. The combat system rewards intuitive play without the need for rifle-counting. There are substantial differences between infantry, artillery, and cavalry: Infantry, tough and resilient, bear the brunt of battle. Artillery can smash attacks or open holes in enemy lines, but is vulnerable and brittle. Cavalry is weak in stand-up combat, but crucial for pursuit and reconnaissance. All units are susceptible to rout when weakened, and the fortunes of war can intervene at any time, so players must maintain reserves. Leaders provide an important supplement to unit capabilities, and armies must protect their headquarters and logistical tail or risk deterioration of their mobility and combat power.<br/><br/>Winning the battle depends upon deployment, thoughtful maneuver to concentrate at the key points, the proper coordination of arms, careful use of leaders and special units, and an understanding of the strengths and weaknesses of each army.<br/><br/>",

        "description": "After the Tannenberg campaign of August-September 1914, East Prussia became a strategic backwater as both sides focused their efforts in Poland. But the Russian threat remained, and the following winter the Germans set about cleaning up their northern flank. A massive attack on the open right flank of the Russian Tenth Army sent it reeling; only the sacrifice of an entire corps in the Augustowo Forest enabled it to escape.<br/><br/>Masuria uses a modification of the Fire &amp; Movement game system. Developed to portray the mechanized battlefields of a later generation, F&amp;M stresses the use of rapidly-concentrated fire support to generate breakthroughs, followed by a rapid penetration by mobile reserves. In 1915, although railroads allowed the rapid shifting of forces on a large scale, no one moved faster than a man on foot on the battlefield, making exploitation ineffective. However, here both players have hidden movement, allowing them to concentrate in unexpected locations to surround and destroy isolated enemy units. The clumsy and inflexible fire support is represented by the artillery brigades available to division and corps commanders. It must be brought to the point of decision, then supplied to give it the firepower to affect the fighting.<br/><br/>The historical outcome at Masuria was the clearing of the East Prussian border. It might have gone differently; Russian reserves were available, and the German forces were a hodge-podge of units of widely varying quality. Both sides have a number of options to turn the fortunes of the campaign. The player who makes the better choices, and backs his strategy to the hilt, will emerge the victor.<br/><br/>Details:<br/><br/>    Level: Brigade<br/>    Hex: 4 miles (6.5 km)<br/><br/><br/>",

        "description": "The long, hot summer is coming to an end, and the ant colonies in the quiet forest glade are increasing their efforts to prepare for the coming winter. Queens are hatching ants to grow their colony&rsquo;s population, Farmers and hunters are scouring the area to stockpile food, and diggers are excavating tunnels to extend their colony&rsquo;s territory. Will you be able to fulfill your colony&rsquo;s harvesting objectives? Will you be able to beat enemy ants to the glade&rsquo;s dwindling resources? Will you be able to avoid the dreaded predators? Will you lead your colony to victory? Will you be the most BrilliAnt?<br/><br/>On their turns, player either play an ant, play a predator, or hatch a new ant in order to be to most effective. Players battle over the same objectives, so be sure to look out on what your opponents are doing. The game ends when a player has completed their sixth objective or when there are no more resources to collect.<br/><br/>Mini BrilliAnts is an ant-based card game playable in 15 minutes, a resource-collection game for 2 to 4 players in which the goal is to complete objectives to score the most victory points. The player whose objectives are worth the most points will win this small euro-style game!<br/><br/>&mdash;description from designer<br/><br/>",

There are 21 different animals, including &quot;Man,&quot; and they range from the lowly mosquito to the mighty Lion.<br/><br/>The game is played in days and each day, players take turns either asking another player a &quot;yes&quot; or &quot;no&quot; question (in a quest to learn the identity of that player's animal) or attacking another player's animal (if they believe their animal is stronger that day). When an attack occurs, the player with the more powerful animal ON THAT DAY wins the attack and stays in the game. The losing animal is revealed to all and the player with the losing animal is out of the game. The game continues until only one player/animal remains and that player/animal is declared King of the Jungle.<br/><br/>Now, while each animal has a usual strength (i.e., the Frog (3), the Crocodile (12), the Lion (20)), each day comes with a different condition (i.e., flood, monsoon, Beautiful Day). The condition of a day can change the strength of some of the animals. So, no animal is always the stronger or the weaker every day of the game. For example, while the Lion (20) on most days is more powerful than most animals, during a flood, the strength of the Crocodile rises to 21 and will defeat the Lion this day. Learning which player has which animal, when to attack another player's animal, and how to keep your animal secret, are key components to becoming King.<br/><br/>To enhance the strategic element, you can play with Advantage Cards (included). There are six different advantage cards and each player is dealt one at the start of the game.  Advantage Cards may increase your animal's strength when attacking, it could allow your animal to &quot;Run Away&quot; from an attack, among other things.<br/><br/>  In addition, if you download the &quot;King of the Jungle Companion App&quot; from your favorite App Stores, you will have information in your hand pertaining to facts about the animals (helpful when asking or answering questions), rule variations, and Trivia (which can be used to incorporate a reincarnation rule or determining who starts the game).  This information is also available on the game's website.<br/> This fun and hilarious game of deception, deceit, and deduction will challenge a player's memory, teach one how to ask questions, and enhance your analytical processes. It is great fun for kids, adults, adults with kids, large groups, and family get togethers. It can be played with up to 21 players!  Enjoy and good luck on becoming King!<br/><br/>",

The main object of the game is to get 10 points, mostly by having your mice get food from the refrigerator back into the mouse-hole. The board is the layout of a house with the mouse-hole on one end and the refrigerator on the other end. Your mice try to get food and your cat tries to stop the other team's mice from doing so. There is a dog counter which can be moved each turn, and you use it to try to go after the opponent's cat. In terms of fighting, you can only fight an enemy (The mouse's enemy is the cat, the dog's enemy is the cat, and the cat's enemies are the mice and the dog). You can also pick up items throughout the house that you can use during combat to modify your strength. If you defeat one of your enemies in combat, it is considered &quot;Clobbered&quot; and cannot function until the next turn. Most items give a strength modifier but some items have special effects. In the basic game, you get 4 points for having your mice get a piece of food back to the mouse-hole, and 1 point when your cat clobbers an opponent's mouse. Optional rules include rules for variable points for the different types of food (cheese, drumstick, apple)<br/><br/>",

        "description": "This game bills itself as being &quot;More simple than chess - More stimulating than checkers&quot;. Each player has an army of 10 pieces that are set up in opposite corners on a conventional chess/checker board. The King piece (shaped like a cross) moves like a regular King in chess and is placed in the dark square corner. Two Circle pieces, which move 1 or 2 spaces in any direction, are placed in front of the King. Three Triangle pieces, which can move 3 spaces or fewer along the dark diagonals, are placed in front of the circles. Four Squares, which move 4 spaces or fewer along a rank or file, are placed in front of the triangles.<br/><br/>Players alternate turns. No piece may jump over another piece except when capturing, and to make a capture a piece MUST travel its maximum movement range. To win you must either checkmate your opponent's King, or move your own King onto the corner space that your opponent's King starts the game on.<br/><br/>",

        "description": "In the near future, on the western coast city of New Metropolis, an evil that has lain dormant for centuries is about to be awakened to the 21st century. Forces of darkness and magic strive to unleash a horror upon the Earth unlike any mankind can remember. The only forces capable of stopping it are rendered impotent by an age-old fear and hatred. Will humanity set aside their differences and stand as one against the darkness? Or will this be humanity's Final Twilight?<br/><br/>Final Twilight is a modern fantasy themed card game for two players.<br/>Players each select a Major Character featured in the game's storyline and build a deck around that character; supporting characters, special action and spells, weapons and items, all ripped from the pages of the story come to life on the game board. <br/>Using Location cards to build a small portion of the great city of New Metropolis, players move between sites and backdrops of the story, dueling other characters including fantastic creatures, horrors of the shadows, and helpful, though innocent, bystanders. <br/>Magic is scarce and unusual in the world of Final Twilight. While hiring goons and allies from our normal world can be easy, summoning the vast forces of nature takes its toll; fantastic characters, spells, and magical abilities all require a small piece of the mage. To cast these spells players spend a portion of their life total, potentially granting them greater power but opening them up to easier defeat. Winning is balancing the quest for power against the will to survive!<br/><br/>Final Twilight is customizable and non-collectable, with each release featuring pre-constructed decks and expansion packs containing just the right cards for a character or an assortment of universal cards suitable for any character.<br/><br/>Revised Edition<br/><br/>April 2013 The Revised edition officially released! Title available through print-on-demands services DriveThruCards.com and TheGameCrafter.com<br/><br/>",

His dictionary is widely considered a milestone in the history of Catalan language, as for the first time modern linguistic ideas were introduced in the grammar.<br/><br/>In the game the players together rebuild Pompeu Fabra's life and works, as well as the various social, cultural and political events that took place during his life: from his birth in Barcelona in 1868 until his death in exile at Prada de Conflent (France) in 1948. Each year in the life of Pompeu Fabra is represented by a card, and the players try to fill in the holes in the chronology, which in the initial setup is formed only by four years. The filling rules are simple and the players receive points each time a grouping of three, six or nine cards is completed.<br/><br/><br/>",

        "description": "The small mouse adds the least weight to the seesaw and the bear the most. The two players try to place the wooden blocks on the seesaw determined by dice in order to achieve the victory conditions. There are three rule versions, each aimed at different age groups of children. In the simplest form the player choose an animal block and then rolls the die, the player then places the animal on the colored square in the seesaw that corresponds to the color of the die. The player whose end of the seesaw goes down first wins. In the second version the players first roll a die and then decide which animal to take, thus they need to assess when to use the heavier animals and when to use the smaller. The third and most advanced rules state that the winning condition is for the other players seesaw to be the heaviest (ie. the lighter side wins), making the game more strategic and suitable for older children.<br/><br/>",

        "description": "A fan of horror movies or slasher films? This free print and play is your chance to see how you measure up to the classic greats. Are you the next Jason? Or will the cops end your reign of terror before it begins?<br/><br/>With victims that can fight back, potential news media alerting even more cops to you, and house weapons that can either help or harm you, things won't be as simple as you think.<br/><br/>Gameplay:<br/><br/>Players will use a deck of cards for the game board, and dice and the rules to get things done. Options include cutting lights off in homes, cutting phone lines, trying to fight and kill the victims, as in any slasher film. Of course, when that doesn't go to plan, then you need to decide how to deal with the police, potential survivor types, and other issues. Will you spend a turn rolling to pick up a weapon to help you kill? Or try to rush in and dispatch foes? It's all up to you. This game allows for quite a bit of choice.<br/><br/>Also included are Evil Points, which you earn, and can use to pull off the sorts of narrow escapes, and horror movie classics like escaping unscathed from gunfire.<br/><br/>Lastly, like any good slasher, on a certain roll, you have rage. This unleashes the true horror of your character. You get to create your own within the rules and see how well, and how long you can survive.<br/><br/>-SLASHER KILLER CUT-<br/><br/>This edition is the culmination of 8 years of this game existing, trial and error, pruning rules, and basically gutting my own creation to rewrite it in a much clearer, more concise way. Along with new rules that streamline the game into a faster experience, with more to do. 2 player variants now also included in the rules, along with an Official Character Sheet and Tokens.<br/><br/>",

Each turn, players draft from a pool of cards, moving the units that correspond to their card's suit a total distance corresponding to their card's rank.<br/><br/>",

        "description": "Colonial Space Wars (CSW) is a tactical game based on a futuristic universe of science fiction that recreates battles between two or more armies. Each army is composed of square game pieces measuring 1.2 x 1.2 inches which represent their units.<br/><br/>During the game, pieces move across a rectangular board divided into squares arranged in rows and columns. In a game of CSW, each player has a number of units in his army which is set depending on the faction they are playing.  We call this set of units a &ldquo;Combat Sword. Two basic Combat Swords (Union of Terra and Alpha Centauri Brotherhood) are available for an introductory game of CSW.<br/><br/>Game pieces represent the units, troops, and vehicles of a fighting force. The pieces have two sides, Front (Illustration and Health arrow) and Back (Name, Attributes and Skills). A player has some pieces with the skill Leader (X). While these pieces are on the board, they grant X command points at the beginning of each turn. Each side alternates turns, making one or more moves depending on the number of Command points available.<br/><br/>Each unit requires a number of command points to be used that turn; this is referred to as &ldquo;Activating &rdquo; the unit. When all command points are spent, the opponent&rsquo;s turn begins. Each unit, upon being activated, can move and act in any order. The possible actions are &ldquo;Move&rdquo;, &ldquo;Embark/disembark&rdquo;, &ldquo;Attack&rdquo; and &ldquo;Use active skills&rdquo;. A typical game is a Sudden Death match, where the winner is the player that eliminates the ir opponent&rsquo;s ability to activate units.<br/><br/>",

        "description": "Tabletop, 1-6 player spy game set in 1941 Berlin that combines classic mystery elements like Clue, but with a defector.<br/> Setting. At the height of World War II, spies from around the world descended on Berlin, Germany to gain intelligence on military operations. Allied forces from countries including United States, England, and Russia engaged in dangerous clandestine operations, code breaking, and subterfuge. The secrets they obtained thwarted military advancements into Western and Eastern Europe. Now, you, the agent behind enemy lines in Berlin in the early 1940s, seek to decipher the enemy plans, avoid being caught by the Schutzstaffel, and uncover the double agent among your peers.<br/><br/>Gameplay. Operation Berlin is a mystery board game with a defector. The goal is to determine which military operation Nazi Germany is planning through process of elimination. Players move as spies through Berlin obtaining information and avoiding hindrances in the form of roadblocks, security guards, and Schutzstaffel. As an added challenge, players may be double agents trying to prevent the other agents from discovering the German plans. This game combines the mystery style of Clue with the player interaction of Resistance to create a unique and intriguing replaying of history.<br/><br/>Mystery Element: There are 9 possible missions characterized by the country of attack and type of attack. One of the missions is selected at random, unknown to the players, and placed aside as the actual secret mission. A tracking sheet assists players in eliminating possible missions when they find or trade information on what cards are not in the secret mission pile. First player to accurately guess the secret mission wins!<br/><br/>Defector: Based on the number of players there may be 1 or 2 double agents. By randomly drawing the agent and double agents cards at the beginning, no one knows what side the other players are on. This adds a covert element that will have players interacting, accusing, and defending until the truth is known. Double agents may choose at any point in the game to reveal their secret, allowing them to play as the German forces. If the double agent remains incognito, all players may accuse a person of being a double agent and force them to be uncovered. But if they guess wrong the game ends in a German victory!<br/><br/>",

Climbing the hills or pushing it on a flat stage?<br/>Keep in mind you&rsquo;re not the only one cycling the road&hellip; A small steering error, misjudgment or a &lsquo;cycling strategy&rsquo; can cause a sensational collision.<br/>Let your cycling team ride as fast as possible and win the bike race!<br/><br/>Introduction<br/>In this parlor game you play within the stages as a cycling team. A team consists of three riders and is played with 2 to 4 players. The duration of a one stage game with 4 players is 1 hour. The results of your team and players standings are recorded. A Tour consists of several stages, with the fastest rider over several stages wearing the yellow jersey. You decide for how long and which stages you want to play.<br/>The game is played with cards. By placing a card on the table you decide how fast you are moving your riders on the trail. You try taking tactical moves and benefit from wind advantage by letting your opponent do the hard work. Cast or save your good cards to d&eacute;marrage when you feel that your opponent cannot.<br/><br/>Side information<br/>The Tour de France board game is published by Just Games but created by Hulst Games. The game is almost identical to the board game &quot;Linkeballen&quot; but had some minor adjustments to increase gameplay.<br/><br/>",

Players race to identify a word that fits the topic, and starts and ends accordingly. The first to get it right collects cards and scores points.<br/><br/>The publisher states that the shuffling of the deck will produce a large variety of combinations, keeping the game fresh to play with very simple rules. The publisher also says you can play the game with more players than shown on the box.<br/><br/>There were three subsequent editions published with new themes.<br/>ワードスナイパーファミリー (Word Sniper Family) - with softer themes aimed at age 5+<br/>ワードスナイパー・イマジン (Word Sniper Imagine) - with more abstract themes to encourage imaginative answers<br/>ワードスナイパーエクストリーム (Word Sniper Extreme) - an expansion deck that adds more context to the themes, and has more letter forms on the flip side.<br/>user summary<br/><br/>「カードの裏表にお題と文字が書かれています。山札をめくって出た文字から始まり、山札の上に書かれているお題に合う言葉を答えるゲームです」 <br/>直感的で分かりやすい単純なルールなのでゲーム初心者でもすぐ始められます。 <br/>カードをシャッフルすればお題と文字の組み合わせが変わるのでリプレイ性も高いです。 <br/>プレイ時間も短く、推奨プレイ人数を超えた人数でもワイワイと遊ぶこともできる楽しいゲームです。<br/>publisher's summary<br/><br/>",

        "description": "Even more legs! Roll the cubes and get shoes for your centipede. Supernogi stonogi is a continuation of the bestselling children's game Nogi stonogi(&quot;SchuhBidu&quot;). It contains elements known from the first part and 4 extensions. The additions diversify the gameplay and allow the game to 6 people. You can enter them one by one or play with everyone at once!<br/><br/>Centipedes want to be as long as possible to stand out from their fellow 'pedes and in SchuhBidu players can help them grow and grow &ndash; but only if they have shoes to place on the centipede feet.<br/><br/>At the start of the game, each player takes a centipede &quot;head&quot; tile, while the feet tiles are placed in the center of the table. On a turn, the active player rolls all four dice, sets aside any he wishes, then rerolls up to two more times, with the option of rerolling dice set aside after the first throw. After his third roll (or earlier, if he wishes), he can take any one foot tile for which he has matching symbols on the dice (with suns counting as a wild symbol) and add it to his centipede<br/><br/>The game ends after all the feet tiles have been claimed, and the player with the longest centipede wins. The rules include a variant for older players in which you can steal shoes from an opponent.<br/><br/>&mdash;description from the publisher (translated)<br/><br/>Jeszcze więcej n&oacute;g!

        "description": "Quester's Keep is a board game for 2 to 6 players. At the beginning of the game each player selects a character at random and is given 3 secret quest cards. These can be replenished at the Keep. The board is made up of hex tiles and the game starts at the Keep tile which is surrounded by 6 randomly chosen land tiles. Each land tile has the name of a location on it and players are looking for the ones that match their quest cards.<br/><br/>In the basic rules, on each player's turn they can move from one tile to an adjacent tile and draw a land tile if none exists in the direction they wish to move. Then they draw a wild encounter card and resolve it. Defeated wild encounters can be traded at the Keep for treasure or character improvements.<br/><br/>A player that moves on to a land card with a name that matches a quest card can reveal the card to draw from the Quest encounter deck instead of the wild encounter deck. If they defeat the encounter they have completed the quest, collect the treasure, and place the quest card face up in their play area so everyone can see how many quests they have completed. However, if they fail or flee the quest a red marker is placed on the location and the quest is now considered and open quest for anyone.<br/><br/>Only treasure that is safely deposited at the keep counts towards victory so you have to get it back to the keep safely. Once someone has completed three quests a 6 round endgame counter is started. At the end of the 6th round each player's banked treasure at the Keep is counted and the player with the most treasure wins.<br/><br/>&mdash;description from the designer<br/><br/>",

The Zulu forces comprise impi (army) units represented on the map by named counters and comprising a variable number of ibutho (regimental) units.  These latter, varying in strength from fifty to ten strength points, are kept concealed off-map in holding boxes corresponding to the various impis, until encountered by  a British force.  The British &ldquo; commander&rdquo; is therefore somewhat uncertain as to what faces him.  British forces manoeuvre as six columns (seven according an erratum) plus the static garrison at Rorke&rsquo;s Drift .<br/><br/>Battles are resolved on a separate battle-board. The British always adopt a defensive posture, either in the open or behind field fortifications.  The Zulus are always the attacking force!  Losses are taken in strength points marked off the players&rsquo; charts.<br/><br/>The game continues until either player reaches a loss-limit or the British occupy Ulundi for two successive Zulu combat phases.  Victory points are then awarded on the basis of the losses inflicted  and by control of the squares containing the Zulu capital of Ulundi, Rorke&rsquo;s Drift and Middle Drift.<br/><br/>Counters were printed on a section of the mapsheet.  <br/>Die-cut, mounted counters were included as a bonus with Far Seas, Strategy &amp; Tactics magazine #125.<br/><br/>",

        "description": "人労 (Jinrou) is a werewolf style game from Japan, set in a business company. The title 人労 means Human Labour (essentially the HR dept), and is a homonym of 人狼 (Jinrou) which means werewolf.<br/><br/>The game is played over six rounds and the players have different roles in the company, each with various skills needed to complete projects. Each role also has secret goals, and players are trying to achieve their goals by the end of the game to win, or to avoid goals and not lose!<br/><br/>In a round, the team leader chooses three players to work on a project. These players (could include the leader) submit two skill cards in secret, which are shuffled and played up. If the six cards show certain combinations, then a player might win or lose on the spot.<br/><br/>But if players can work out what role a person has, they can determine their goals, and play skill cards to make them fail, or make themselves win. By disguising their own roles, players have more chances to achieve their objectives and avoid being eliminated.<br/><br/>For example, the CEO does not want to be in four projects, because they will die of over work. The Lazybones wants the CEO to die, or wants the projects to fail so they don't have to work. The Secretary wants to find romance with anybody but the Lazybones. The Temps want to be in four projects so they get hired permanently, and so on. And everyone wants to fall in love with the Secretary.<br/><br/>Lazybones will win the game if the projects fail to complete, or if the diligent workers fail to take their vacations or miss out on romancing the Secretary.<br/><br/>The various goals and possible outcomes means winning the game  depends on concealing roles and identifying others'.<br/><br/>The publisher says:<br/><br/>This is a game about hiding your identity. You are an employee of a company and you are involved in a secret project, hiding your true identity from each other. You have to achieve your goals while taking care of your paycheck and your love life!<br/><br/>Each player has a hand of cards that matches his or her abilities, and they all work together to move a single piece through the backgammon of event cards (i.e. projects) towards the goal.<br/>There is also a lot of fun to be had in the squares where the pieces stop. Squatting, talking in gyaru-speak and other events will help you to win the game.<br/><br/>正体隠匿系のゲームです。あなたはとある企業の会社員として、互いの正体を隠したまま秘密プロジェクトに参加します。<br/>有給消化、社内恋愛をこなしながら自分の目的を達成しましょう！<br/>プレイヤーは各自能力に合わせた手札を持ちます。全員で協力して一つの駒をすごろく状にならんだイベントカード（＝プロジェクト）の上をゴールを目指して進めますが、中にはプロジェクト達成などどうでもいい人も・・・？<br/>駒がとまったマス目にもお楽しみがいっぱい。スクワットやギャル語で会話などイベントをこなしながら、勝利を目指します。<br/><br/>",

It places the player in the position of the head of some neutral or belligerent country and lets him use his own judgment as to how present international problems should be met and overcome.<br/><br/>&quot;TACTICS may be played by two belligerents, or by two belligerents and one or both neutrals.<br/><br/>&quot;The object for belligerents is to blockade opponent belligerent's SEAPORT and for neutrals to trade for profit.  Blockade is accomplished when a belligerent's SEAPORT is completely cut off from the sea.  Trade is accomplished when a SUPPLY SHIP is moved into another player's port.&quot;<br/><br/>Neutrals accumulate victory points through trade, but may be attacked by belligerents, which allows them to play a diplomatic protest card. If a third protest card is accepted (they can be dodged by paying a gold), then that neutral joins the war against the offending nation. Neutrals may try to provoke attacks in order to pile on and share the war loot with the victorious belligerent.<br/><br/>War is a game of manoeuver: battleships kill transports easily, but killing a battleship requires getting two friendly battleships on opposite sides of the target. Each nation has two planes, but these only come into play through chance cards, as do submarines (each of which lurks in a particular square of the board and kills an enemy ship that moves onto the square).<br/><br/>",

The coach that handles better his economics, will sign in the new soccer star!<br/><br/>During the match the home team coach gets 6 Attack and 6 Defence cards and the away team coach gets 5 Attack and 5 Defence cards. The home team coach attacks first using one of his Attack cards and the away team coach tries to defend his team using one of his Defence cards. Then the away team coach makes his move using one of his Attack cards and the home team coach uses his Defence cards. Each Attack card describes an event, for example &quot;Injury&quot; or &quot;Goal&quot; or &quot;Penalty&quot; etc. and the Defence cards deactivate the Attack cards. When all attacks have ended, the coach who has scored more goals is the winner.<br/><br/>The game can be played for as many seasons as you like and never ends. Every match is different than the previous and this is what makes this game really exciting! One season lasts about 1 hour.<br/><br/>Man of The Match is a very entertaining, easy-to-play, fast and funny game which can be played by people of all ages. It is very addictive to those who love soccer, but people who don't even watch soccer show a lot of excitement playing it!<br/><br/>",

If the other player has it, the card gets handed to the active player. If the other player doesn't have the card, the active player takes one card from the deck and ends his turn. Next player is now the active player. There's one condition - active player has to have at least one card of the family he's asking for. Once a player has all 6 members of the family he can place it in front of him. Whoever has the most completed families at the end of the game wins.<br/><br/>",

For each successfully described word, they are allowed to ask a letter in their code word. The team who first guesses their code word wins.<br/><br/>The words that have to be described are printed on 110 cards, with six words per card, two for each of these three categories: verbal description, drawing and pantomime. One group member explains, draws or pantomimes (which of these is decided by a die); the other members of the group have to guess the word. If they manage to guess correctly before the time is up, they are allowed to ask if the first letter of the word they successfully described and guessed features in their secret code word. If the answer is yes, they write down the letter. If the answer is no, the team crosses out that letter. Then it is the next team's turn. At the start of each of their turns, if one team thinks they know their code word, they may name their solution. If it is correct, they win; if not, the game continues as usual.<br/><br/>",

        "description": "Operation Badr, The Syrian Assault on the Golan Heights, Oct. '73 is a fast-paced game of the battles on the Golan Heights in 1973. Players learn to deal with the complexities of modern armies through playable rules that simulate the differences in doctrine and organization between the two sides as they strive for victory. The role of aircraft and of the antiaircraft missile is vividly portrayed through an easily mastered air power system. Engineers, artillery, fortifications, and supply each play their historic function in achieving victory or staving off defeat.<br/><br/>&quot;On October 6, 1973, the people of Israel gathered to celebrate Yom Kippur, the most solemn of Jewish holidays. At five past two in the afternoon, Jerusalem time, their tranquility was shattered by massive artillery and aerial bombardment along both Egyptian and Syrian borders. Syria's Operation Badr had begun. Across the so-called &quot;Purple Line&quot;, a Syrian torrent, spearheaded by some 1,500 tanks and 1,000 guns, poured across the Golan Heights. Against them stood two understrength Israeli brigades with a total of approximately 180 tanks and 60 guns. The Syrian intention: to drive to Haifa and cut Israel in two.&quot;<br/><br/>300 Counters<br/><br/>Sequence of play:<br/>1. Air Unit Assignment<br/>2. Syrian Air Bombardment<br/>3.

Each player makes his grids with an S (for START) in the upper left square and completes with numbers from 1 to 15 the others in any way he wishes and in secret. Then they both reveal their grids and the first player, from the S, moves to any other adjacent square in his grid. The other player does the same. Whoever ends in the highest number won the round. The player winning the first round starts the second round. Play continues like this and if the numbers are the same, the two players have a tie. If one of the players is left without moves before he can move the entire grid, he loses by KO. The player who won the most rounds wins the game.<br/><br/>",

Train your band members, play concerts, compete for fans, release albums and dominate the metal charts! Perform the best at the &quot;Thrash Awards&quot; ceremony at the end of the game and claim the metal throne!<br/><br/>Each round in Thrashing Dice, you have the opportunity to go to one or more of the available locations on the board. For example: the guitar shop, the Rock Academy, the Metal Club, the radio station or the recording studio. You'll have to choose wisely: Do you start with playing a club concert to increase get your name out there? Or maybe better to rehearse a little more for the big concert on the weekend? Or is it time to finally upgrade your instrument?<br/><br/>During the game's six rounds you'll rehearse till you drop, play concert after concert, and build your fan-base. You'll record albums in the studio, give interviews at the radio station, and fight hard to reach the top of the metal charts. And at the final concert at the end of the game you'll give everything you've got! Afterwards, in front of a packed house, the highly coveted &quot;Thrash Awards&quot; will be given out. Who's produced the best album? Who has the best individual artist? And for the finale: Which band has achieved the greatest fame and will claim the metal throne? One thing is certain: The throne is only big enough for one!<br/><br/>The main differences between Thrash'n Roll and Thrashing Dice:<br/>1. number of players, now you can play up to 5 players,<br/>2. solo and duel variant is included in new version,<br/>3. Thrashing Dice has two-sided board (one for regular play and second for solo and duel variant,<br/>4. new more balanced scoring rules,<br/>5. few changes in game mechanic,<br/>6. added new characters,<br/>7. new event deck for solo and duel play,<br/>8. more cards in fan deck and scandal deck.<br/><br/>",

        "description": "Body Party plays like a team Twister, with each team competing to hold a half-dozen body part cards between their bodies before anyone else can do so.<br/><br/>To start the game, players form teams of two or three players, with at least one person serving as referee. The referee keeps the card deck in hand to help facilitate gameplay; each card shows one body part on the front and another body part (or possibly the same one) on the back.<br/><br/>On a turn, the referee shows the active team the part depicted on the top card of the deck. This team can take this card or pass on it, but then they must take the next card. The teammates must now attempt to hold this card between the two players using the two body parts depicted. If they drop this card, their turn ends; if they drop other cards already held, however, they can continue to work with the current card, despite the tears that will inevitably ensue. Then the next team takes its turn.<br/><br/>The game continues until at least one team holds six cards. If all teams have had the same number of turns and only one team holds six cards, this team wins; if several teams hold six cards, play another round, continuing the game until one team holds more cards than any other at the end of a round. This team wins!<br/><br/>As a variant, Body Party includes a half-dozen cards that feature a body part on one side and a household object on the other (table, wall, chair, floor). These cards must be placed between a player on the team and the depicted item.<br/><br/>",

In SpyQuest(TM), you'll watch one of three action-packed espionage adventure movies on your own VCR. Each of these half-hour long Hollywood-quality motion pictures was produced exclusively for SpyQuest and bridges the gap between live-action adventure and you, the player. Next, you'll be traveling the world uncovering clues to a secret location. Sound easy? Not so fast. You'll have to decipher the configuration of a key, tooth by tooth. You'll be interrogated about your knowledge of the film as you compete against other agents on the same mission. They'll use road blocks, naval mines, spy scopes, and sabotage kits against you to reach the location first. Of course, you can use the same tactics on them, so anything goes! Be the first agent to uncover the secret location, travel there, and survive a triple interrogation and you're proven secret agent material. With five sets of interrogation questions and 64 different secret location possibilities, you'll have a new and different adventure every time you play.

        "description": "Triple Flips 4 includes Save the Earth, Time Warp, and Robot Attack.<br/><br/><br/>     Save the Earth is a 1-player game that seems to be inspired by Missile Command.  Four missiles are bearing down on Earth, and you make straight, orthogonal moves based on the die roll, trying to hit the missiles before they reach Earth.  Each turn, the missiles advance - although, if you are blocking a missile's path downward, it will wait until you are out of the way to advance.  You essentially have 9 turns to fly around frantically to destroy the four missiles - well, 7 for two of them.<br/><br/><br/><br/>     Time Warp is a simple elimination game for 2-4 players, comprising two concentric, rectangular tracks - past and future - interconnected at four points by time machines.  That is the gimmick.  Roll, then move one way or the other, trying to land on an opponent to eliminate her.  If you land on a time machine, you may use it to switch tracks and go again.<br/><br/><br/><br/>     Robot Attack is a 2-player game, which seems related to Hnefatafl.  One player tries to traverse the passageways, by orthogonal moves from her die roll, to her spaceship, which conveniently lies behind the opponent's four robots.  The robot player tries to trap the other player with his robots, by splitting each roll among however many robots he wishes.  Not only are the robots inherently &frac14; the speed of the spaceman, but they also are unable to move backward, toward the ship.  As a result, the robot player must be attentive in his move choices.  Fortunately for him, most of the board has four or fewer chokepoints to cover at any given vertical slice; unfortunately, players are neither allowed to waste pips from their die roll, nor retread a space on the same turn.<br/><br/><br/>",

A picture is worth a thousand words&quot; is a creative social game which requires players to draw various concepts (ranging from historical figures to abstract ideas) and to guess exactly what was drawn.<br/><br/>Each team receives two stacks of cards &ndash; assignment cards and challenge cards. Assignment cards point to one of the five categories of words (or phrases) that are present in the game: objects, actions, names, activities and abstract ideas. Challenge cards are used to either make the game harder or easier. For example, a card may force a player to draw with his/her eyes closed, or it can allow the first letter of the word to be drawn.<br/><br/>Compared to other &quot;drawing&quot; games, Draw-it-if-you-can has a much lower degree of chance. Since players know each other's creative capabilities, they can decide who will draw the abstract concepts and who will have the &quot;hard task&quot; of drawing a chair. Some players will try to simplify their goal by using an according challenge card while others will attempt to earn more points for their team by using other types of cards to make their task more challenging.<br/><br/>",

        "description": "&quot;Monstrum&quot; (Monster) is a quite easy fantasy quest type game. Game objectives which players have to achieve to win are: 1) to reach place called &quot;Kopalnia Zezere&quot; (Zezere Mine) after: 2) killing at least one Monster, 3) gaining 30 points of strenght.<br/><br/>During the game players have to fight with hostile creatures. They can sometimes find special objects and gain spells which can be used in further fights or help in achieving game goal.<br/><br/>There is almost no interaction between players - which can be recognized as a big minus in gameplay.<br/><br/>The origins of the game are dated in 1985 when Jacek Ciesielski published its rules, cards and board in magazine &quot;Razem&quot; (Together). Rules and board for this earlier version were different. Graphics on game cards were simpler, but almost every player who had opportunity to play 1985 and 1990 versions claims that older version is better looking. Changes in 1990 probably gone too far ;)<br/><br/>Graphic design came from Polish comics artist - Witold Parzydło.<br/><br/>",

The player with the highest number of victory points at the end wins the game.<br/><br/>",

The frantic activities of the harvest have drawn to a close; crops are no longer at risk to weather and calamity; the peace of winter is about to descend. It is a time of transition. In the Chinese district of Chi-Ka and in its principal city of Chi-Ka-Go, the festival is an occasion for fireworks, parades, music and gaiety. Traditionally, the Festival of the Autumn Moon is also an occasion for reflection and thanksgiving. In many households, the entire family gathers and an elaborate feast is prepared. Effigies representing Happiness, Wealth and Long Life are displayed, and some families, recalling the ancient traditions, conclude the celebration with a bonfire in which the effigies are burned, their smoke rising to the heavens to signify gratitude and respect. Two of the wealthiest families of the district, the Wu and the Hoo families, have for many generations celebrated the festival together. This year both families' leaders, their women, and a few prominent guests will meet one day in advance of the festival to enjoy an elaborate feast, drink from the ceremonial Cup of Wisdom, recite poetry and contemplate the events of the past year. Children and less prominent family members will arrive the next day, the day of the festival, for feasting, revelry and, after sunset, lighting the Fire of Gratefulness. The site of the gathering and festival celebration this year will be the Hoo summer home at Hoo Hung Wu. A small group of islands situated in the middle of the great river Mi-Si-Pi, Hoo Hung Wu is co-owned by the Hoos and Wus, but only the Hoos have occupied it. They have built several buildings on the West Isle, including their summer home, Hoo House. East Isle is not occupied, though the Hoos maintain its roads and bridges. Hoo House is a magnificent dwelling in a pleasant forest setting. Several wings contain rooms for many guests and servants. Through the years the Hoos have also built smaller dwellings on West Isle where family members, or guests, who desire seclusion may find it.<br/><br/>CHARACTERS<br/>Hoo Li-gan, General Shang Hai-shek, Hao Dee-doo, Pen Ta-gon, Wee Ping, called &quot;Willow Blossom&quot;, Wu Pi, called &quot;Joyous Flower&quot;, Hoo Ting, called &quot;Jade Owl&quot;, and Ding Ling, called &quot;Silver Bell&quot;.<br/><br/>",

Beyond the Urals postulates that the Germans had defeated the Red Army in their 1941 invasion of the Soviet Union, but failed to force the capitulation of the Soviet Union itself. In early 1941, Soviet leaders had decided to deploy their armed forces &quot;up front&quot; on the border with the Third Reich, as chief of the Red Army armored forces, General D.G. Pavlov, had proposed. As a result of this alternative deployment, the Germans destroy the Red Army on the frontiers, sweep eastwards, and take Moscow, Leningrad and Stalingrad in late 1941.<br/><br/>However, in this alternative time-line, the Soviets keep fighting even after the Germans reached their planned Archangel-Astrakhan stop line. Being given no alternatives other than to suffer the consequences of German exploitation and terror in the East, or to continue a desperate resistance, the Russians and other Soviet peoples go on fighting. The remnants of the Red Army make their stand to protect the great industrial complexes east of the Urals, hoping to draw in the Germans for the final decisive battle. As 1942 opens, Hitler orders the Wehrmacht to head into the East for the final battle of annihilation in Eurasia, beyond the Urals.<br/><br/>Game Scale:<br/>Game Turn: 7 days<br/>Hex: 20 miles / 32.4 kilometers<br/>Units: Corps to Armies<br/><br/>Game Inventory:<br/>One 22 x 34&quot; full-color mapsheet<br/>One dual-side printed countersheet (176 5/8&quot; counters)<br/>One 16-page Beyond the Urals rulebook<br/><br/>Solitaire Suitability: High<br/>Complexity Level: Low<br/>Players: 2 or more<br/>Playing Time: 5-10 hours<br/><br/>Note: One 6-sided die is needed for play<br/><br/>",

To create that bank at the start of play, place the 25 diamonds in the middle of the table. Players shuffle the cards, then each receives four cards.<br/><br/>At the start of a turn, the active player declares whether they'll rob the bank or another player, then they roll the die to determine how many diamonds they'll steal. This die roll can be modified by the cards everyone plays &mdash; whether positive (green) cards or negative (yellow) cards &mdash; after which the player receives from (or gives to) the bank or an opponent the appropriate number of diamonds. The player takes three more cards from the deck, then ends their turn.<br/><br/>It's time to use your skills!<br/><br/>",

Then they count to 10 and flip over a card depicting a configuration of blocks in a stack.  Everyone has their own set of blocks and must complete the construction before the top stops spinning to advance.<br/><br/>Notes: If some one's scoring marker is on top of yours and you advance you will carry their scoring marker along with yours.  There's also a couple short cuts on the track that can only be taken if your are carrying someone or if you're carrying no more than one other person.  Also, there are a couple spots you can stop and help someone else complete their construction so that they can catch up and you can take the short cut together, etc.<br/><br/>",

If the question is answered correctly, the card is kept and the person with the most number of cards after 5 or 10 minutes is the winner.

Forage, Salvage, Recruit, and Assault all use Dice Rolls to predict success. Whereas control is Placement specific and is an active or passive bonus earned from Controlling The Area.<br/><br/>The game at its heart is a Player Elimination Game that revolves around a Take That mechanic where player life is represented by  Food, and by Wastelanders alive.   The game is lost when all Wastelanders have been killed or starved to death the later dealing with major elements of Player Verse Environment.<br/><br/>What is a Socio-Economic Apocalypse?

Bluff your way through history!<br/><br/>ChronoSphere is a bluffing and historical trivia card game. Players play their cards into a shared circular timeline called the ChronoSphere. Players try to arrange the events and inventions shown on their cards in chronological order, using one half of the ChronoSphere for cards from the time period AD and the other for the time period BC. The first player to successfully play all of their cards is the winner. Players can challenge the plays of their opponents and force them to draw cards for invalid plays. A player can also win by completing a fully valid twelve-card ChronoSphere.<br/><br/>",

It is inexpensively produced, with a small cardboard board, a 3D cardboard backdrop, and 14 cardboard playing pieces that are inserted into plastic stands.<br/><br/>One player controls the 13 deputies (the posse), the other controls the 1 outlaw.  The object of the game is for the posse player to surround the outlaw such that he can no longer make a valid move.  If that happens, the posse player wins.  The outlaw player tries not to get cornered and wins if he is able to remove enough deputies from the board such that it is impossible for the posse player to win.<br/><br/>Play starts with the outlaw player who must move his outlaw each turn, if possible (if not, he loses the game).  He can move the outlaw to any open orthogonally adjacent space.  He can also jump a deputy piece, like in Checkers, and thereby remove the deputy piece from the board.  The outlaw can make multiple jumps in a single turn, again like in Checkers.<br/><br/>The posse player simply moves one of his deputy pieces into any open orthogonally adjacent space on his turn, trying to create a situation on the board where the outlaw player can not move his piece.<br/><br/>",

Play of the ball is somewhat programmed by line-of-flight paths, which are designated by the roll of the &quot;position&quot; die at tee-off. But the real key to success is in the choosing of the correct combination of the yardage dice that will get the ball where you want it to go. 3 large dice from 50-100 yards, 2 medium dice from 10-60 yards, 1 putting die from 10-30 yards, and 1 trap die from 0-50 yards. But clever combinations of the dice and a bit of luck, you just might be able to hole-out on this turn, or if you are really lucky, a hole-in-one!<br/><br/>",

For example, if the comp generated the number 436, and your first guess was 423, the comp's number column would light the 2 (meaning you have 2 numbers correct), and would light the 1 in the sequence column (telling you you have 1 number in the correct sequence). Players get one guess and must then pass the unit to the next player. The first player to enter the correct number wins. The game can generate 3, 4 or 5 digit numbers to increase the difficulty.<br/><br/>",
