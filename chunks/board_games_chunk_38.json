        "description": "Head Hunter is a set of four Head Hunter expansion cards for the base game Show Business. The cards should be shuffled into the original deck and played together.<br/><br/>Head Hunter cards apply all original rules from the basic game. As a special skill Head Hunter can be played as one of 10 other professions like Groupie, DJ, Trend Expert etc. Simply, it is a sort of  a joker.<br/><br/>Head Hunter cannot perform the action &quot;Trend&quot;. It cannot manipulate any of 4 trend dice.<br/><br/>Head Hunter expansion is free and will be available on publisher stand during Essen fair 2011.<br/><br/>---<br/><br/>Edit: The Head Hunter card turned out to be a misprint that was done in the wrong size, so it couldn't be shuffled into the deck. There never was a correct version of this expansion at all.<br/><br/>",

        "description": "9 Kingdoms is a miniatures adventure game that combines elements of roleplaying and wargaming. It provides a unique interpretation of the common fantasy races and monsters for game play. The game can be scaled from a small handful of figures up to several dozen.  Players can customize their own figures, individualizing them with skills and building them up with experience both within a single game and from game to game. The rulebook provides a variety of scenarios, including everything from straight up battles to dungeon crawls to an assault on a wizard's stronghold.<br/><br/>Unlike other miniatures games, a figure is not killed with 1 or 2 wounds. Each figure is given a specific set of points sources that represent both its health and effectiveness. As a figure is wounded, it becomes less effective throughout the course of the game.  The combat system is simultaneous and figures make opposed rolls for both offense and defense to determine combat results.<br/><br/>In addition to the point sources, figures can be &quot;trained&quot; in different skills including weapons, armor, magic, and many other types of special abilities. Figures with different skills can be combined in an endless variety of ways to create effective combat and adventuring squads. Each of the 10 major species in the 9 Kingdoms has its own special racial abilities which makes the different teams original and dynamic.<br/><br/>All scenarios also incorporate an element of exploration in the form of encounter tokens on the board.  These tokens can be flipped during the game to uncover treasures, traps, powerful artifacts and even wandering monsters.  This adds an element of risk and unpredictability to the game as an encounter could turn out to be either be dangerous or profitable.<br/><br/>",

        "description": "Company to Divisional level wargame rules for use with 20mm miniature figures.  Each soldier represents approximately 10 men. Vehicles and support weapons represent 3 real-life equivalents.  The aim of the game is to recreate World War 2 battles.  A players wins when one side is forced to retire from the battlefield, caused by morale checks and losses. It uses a set of mechanisms to create a fast-play set that reflects the realistic experience of a WW2 soldier.  All the equipment available to the soldier in WW2 is included, such as support weapons, vehicles, artillery and aircraft. The rules reward players that use the equipment tactically rather than the simple &quot;see the enemy and charge&quot;.<br/><br/>The game lasts up to 15 turns.  Each turn has a number of phases - move, spot, aircraft, fire, morale and orders. The winner of the initiative for each turn determines which side goes first in each phase. A single 6-sided die is used for almost all mechanisms. Vehicles, if hit, require a further roll to determine damage.  Morale is checked once a unit has received a number of casualties which varies with nationality.  Once a number of base units has received adverse morale checks, the overall morale of the army is checked each turn until one side eventually pulls backs or routs..<br/><br/>",

Many efforts have been made to turn Sudoku into a board game, but the integrity of the puzzle always ended up being compromised. It was always a pain to setup and the truth be told not a real fun board game - with no real advantage for you the player.<br/><br/>So here comes Du-KO taking the concept of Sudoku to a whole new level, allowing for multi-players but still respecting the integrity of the solitaire player too. From 1- 9 players of all ages from 8 to 88 can easily and happily play Du-KO for a guaranteed good time.<br/><br/>The object of the game is to finish your section of the Sudoku grid first before your opponent(s). Each player takes their turn placing a peg in an open space within their designated portion of the puzzle. You'll go from clueless to competent your first game, and by your second game you'll have advanced from competent to competitive. Here's where it gets cut-throat and smokin' hot! You've been warned.<br/><br/>The amazing part about Du-KO is that it is self-checking! When you play, the game will tell you instantly that whether you&rsquo;re wrong or right. If the peg is correct it will set all the way down, if incorrect it will remain slightly elevated and then must be removed and replayed on your next turn.&quot;<br/><br/>",

        "description": "Word Scramble bills itself as a &quot;phonological awareness and word-building game&quot;.  Tiles are used to make words in the middle of playing board.<br/><br/>Based on the squares on which their pawns land, players either blindly draw a tile, move a tile already on the board or read all the words on the board.  Five board spaces direct the player to draw a tile give them the choice between the word beginning or ending piles.  Nineteen spaces specify from which pile the player should draw.  Those spaces also direct the player to define the word played, rhyme it, use it in a sentence or use it in a question.  Four spaces direct the player to read all the words already on the board, awarding four points for doing so.  Landing on one of the four corners allows the player to move a tile already on the board.<br/><br/>Tiles drawn or moved are placed on one of 61 spaces in the middle of the board which have either word beginnings or endings.  Harder-to-match tiles or spaces are worth more points than easy ones.  Points values range from one to six.  Play ends after one player reaches a predetermined number of points.<br/><br/>",

The most played game on the floor: Lucky Lead.<br/><br/>Played a bit like Blackjack (but with mechanics somewhat reminiscent of Russian Roulette), Lucky Lead involves 2-3 players and a dealer*. At each hand, the dealer chooses six Chamber Cards; each one is either Loaded or Unloaded. At each player's turn, the player is dealt one Chamber Card. Before he plays it, he has to choose whether he's going to play it against himself, another player or the dealer. Each action has a different consequence.

        "description": "Description of the game.  Totality is a unique board game that combines the features of a card game with the mechanisms of a board game; it plays in the current era and simulates the total range of the human condition. The heart of the game is the deck of 64 unique and intriguing cards.  There are 4 suits of 16 cards.  These suits represent the 4 planes of existence - physical,  biological, cognitive, and social.  Each plane (suit) has 4 unique elements and a color.  Each card in the suit is composed of a combination of those four elements.  Cards have a number of elements from zero to four.   The mix of elements is shown on each card.  Each card has a game action line.  The game area (world) consists of a 4X4  array of cards laid face up and a space in front of each player to keep sets and action cards.  Players move through the world to gather cards.  Each player is represented by a marker or token.<br/><br/>Object of the game: to build the character with the most experience by gathering sets of cards while moving around the board (world).<br/><br/>Setup.  1)  Shuffle the deck; 2) Deal one card to each player.  The player with the highest card number goes first.  Players keep this card as part of their hand; 3) Then deal the 4X4 world face down.  Before play begins, each player, starting with the first, places his token in the world on a different location.  After the tokens are played, the location cards are turned face up; 4)  Deal 2 more cards to each player for a total of 3. The rest of the deck is placed face down as the draw deck (DD); place it so that the longer side of the cards is next to the world; 5) A discard (recycle) heap (DH) will be created during play; place it so that the shorter side of the cards is next to the world.  Cards are discarded face down.<br/><br/>Play.  Each turn consists of just one of the following actions unless there are effects in play that allow more: 1) Activate or remove a special effect.  The game line of most cards can create effects that change the play.  2) Move.  Movement is in a vertical or horizontal direction only (like a rook in chess).   At the beginning of the game, players can move one location per turn.  3) Gather a card from the world.  Players may gather the card under their token. 4)  Build or dismantle a set.  This is the heart of the game.  A player grows by playing sets in his character area.  Sets consist of one or more cards that satisfy specific criteria from set theory.  5.  Combat.  Combat may occur when a player (attacker) tries to move to or through a site occupied by other players (defenders), or attacks players at his current location. Combat involves betting; outcomes are governed by a simple table.  6) Open a trading session. Any player may  open a trading session his turn. Anything may be traded: token locations, sets, cards, seats, drinks.  There are two ways to end the game.  A player may end the game when he has sets with all 16 elements of the deck present.  Otherwise, the game ends instantly when the draw deck is depleted for the first time.<br/><br/>",

Knights cost money and the Nobles only collect a certain amount each tournament season to pay for their knights. The Tournaments are played by Nobles secretly deciding in which order their knights will compete and then by simply turning their cards face down in their hand to create a small deck they begin drawing their cards one at a time off the top of these decks to play against another Noble's knights in individual competition. Points are scored for the Noble with the highest value knight played (six cards will be played against one another in this way) - and 1 glory is gained by the Noble with the most points at the end of that competition.<br/><br/>A Tournament is made up of each Noble in the game plying each other once in a competition like the one described above.<br/><br/>Once the tournament season is over players have to return some knights to their season decks / hire other knights / collect gold / and try to gain more glory in the next Tournament.<br/><br/>The Game ends when one Noble gains enough glory to win the Kings favor, and become champion of the realm.<br/><br/>",

        "description": "An abstract strategy game for 2 players that adds a twist to the classic black vs. white setup: grey pieces that belong equally to both players.<br/><br/>The game mechanism revolves around enclosure (either partial or full) of other, single pieces on a square grid board.  Surrounded pieces can be either removed from play, replaced with upgraded pieces, or can cause extra turns or even a win, depending on the degree of enclosure (i.e. being surrounded by either 6, 7, or 8 pieces belonging to the player) and also the color of central piece being enclosed.<br/><br/>A turn consists of a player either placing or moving a piece, and then acting out consequences if their move results in one or more enclosure situations.  In standard game play, the color of the piece to be played (either the player's own color or grey) is decided by the flip of a fair coin, but the game can also be played without that element of chance by simply alternating between the two.<br/><br/>The game ends either when a player causes a piece to be entirely enclosed with pieces belonging to them filling all 8 surrounding squares (in which case they are the winner), or in the event that no open spaces remain on the board (in which case the player with the most pieces of their specific color is the winner.)<br/><br/>The game is both fun for beginners and yet dynamic enough to also engage experienced strategists.<br/><br/>",

You would place your token, either Daniel David Donkey- Democrat, or Edward Elephant-Republican, on Georgia and answer the question.  If you are correct, you win the electoral votes for Georgia.  Then, you would place a Georgia-shaped piece that is either red(Republican) or blue(Democrat) on Georgia to show that you won Georgia's electoral votes.  Your opponent would take a turn and you continue this until one of you reaches 270 electoral votes.  The questions range from American history to pop culture.

If the card is a dragon's tail, the player may place it next to the child card; if not, the card is discarded.  Once a tail card has been placed, future draws of a dragon's body or dragon's head are allowed to be (and must be) played next to the tile, whereas future draws of a tail are then discarded.  Drawing a dragon's head completes a dragon.<br/><br/>After completing a dragon, the player, on his or her next turn, make take another child card, if any remain, and begin anew the process of attempting to create the longest dragon.<br/><br/>If the draw pile is exhausted, the discard pile is shuffled to form a new draw pile.<br/><br/>The game ends when sufficient cards have been drawn and placed such that no further legal plays can be made.  The winner is the player who created the longest dragon.<br/><br/>",

        "description": "The Immigration game is an adaptation of John Conway's abstract zero-player game of Life to a two-player game.  It was first described in Lifeline, a newsletter dedicated to Conway's Life, in 1971.<br/><br/>In the Immigration game, players setup the game by taking turns and placing 5 pieces each of their color on a 25x25 rectangular grid.  Each position in the 25x25 grid can be either alive or dead, the living positions (or &ldquo;cells&rdquo;) are those that have a counter placed in them. Once setup is complete, the pieces are not moved and board positions evolve without player intervention according to the rules  of Conway&rsquo;s Game of Life, as listed below:<br/><br/>At each turn (or &ldquo;generation&rdquo;) the state of a cell is determined by the following rules:<br/><br/>1.     If a live cell has less than two neighbors in the eight neighboring cells, it dies in the next generation (&ldquo;loneliness&rdquo;)<br/><br/>2.     If a live cell has at two or three neighbors in the eight neighboring cells, it stays alive in the next generation.<br/><br/>3.     If a live cell has more than three neighbors in the eight neighboring cells, it dies in the next generation (&ldquo;overcrowding&rdquo;).<br/><br/>4.     If a dead cell has exactly three neighbors in the eight neighboring cells, it becomes alive in the next generation (&ldquo;reproduction&rdquo;).<br/><br/>New living cells, which come into being by having exactly 3 neighbors, take on the color of the majority of those three neighbors.  Note that all cells in the 25 x 25 board have 8 neighbors each as the board is considered to wrap around the edges to each opposite side.<br/><br/>After the 10th generation, the player with the most living cells is allowed to place a counter thus adding an additional live cell of his or her color, followed by a turn by the other player.  If both players have the same amount of live cells, generations continue to develop until one player has a majority, at which time the generations stop so players can place their new live cells and the process begins again.<br/><br/>Play continues this way until one of the players has no live cells left and the winning player is the only one with live cells on the board.<br/><br/>",

There's grown and spliced creatures; sinister, calculated robots; demented magical incantations; and fervent warriors/scholars from assorted historical and fantasy sources.<br/><br/>The goal of the game is to acquire victory points, which are gained through several different types of actions.  Gameplay involves several cards that create a gameboard; are drawn and played by players; and dictate what players do (through an avatar).  Players take turns gaining resources, playing cards, and fighting creatures as they interact with the board and opponents.<br/><br/>",

On each turn, the player will select a British Leader and build forts, move, draw event chit, or reorganize. Actions are limited by the Leader's Action Points. Enemy actions are determined by event chits, which are drawn when entering hostile territory. Combat is based on unit strength with units rolling dice equal in number to their combat strength. British eliminate a unit on a roll of 5 or 6 and Zulu eliminate a unit on a roll of 6.<br/><br/>The goal is capture Chief Cetewayo and subdue as many hostile Zulu areas as possible. The player must manage both the Zulu forces and the British political will to stay in the war. The game ends after 8 turns and victory points are measured on a scale of Total British Defeat to Total British Victory.<br/><br/>",

If it is incorrect the card is placed at the bottom of the pack and the player who gave the wrong punchline misses one round which means that he cannot give the punchline to the next joke even if he knows it. It is then the turn of Player No 2 to pick a card from the pack and read out a Joke. The process is repeated round and round the group until all the cards have been won, and the player with most cards is the winner. A player cannot offer a punchline to a joke he is reading out himself. If two players shout &ldquo;Joker!&rdquo; at exactly the same moment the younger of the players gets to offer the punchline.<br/><br/>For a variation on the three games try the following: even if a player gives an incorrect punchline, the Joke Teller may award that player the card if they decide that the alternative punchline given is clever or funny enough.<br/><br/>",

Your companions are more than a little odd, and it's up to you to use your social deduction skills (and some well-placed bluffs) to make it home safely. <br/><br/><br/>One Stormy Night is fast, light, social deduction game for 2-10 players. Like most social deduction games, every player has a secret role. Figuring out everyone's secret roles (and knowing when to keep yours secret) helps you gather the votes you need to win the game. In a small group, it can be a thoughtful and strategic game. In a large group, One Stormy Night fill the role of a party game!<br/><br/>Gameplay<br/>Every player has a secret role: Vampire, Werewolf, or Human. Each role has a corresponding deck on the table (a Vampire Deck, a Werewolf Deck, and a Human Deck), but players do not know which deck is which.<br/><br/>During each turn, the players will vote to reveal a card from one deck. When a deck runs out of cards, the game is over. If the Vampire Deck runs out first, the Vampires win. If the Werewolf Deck runs out first, the Werewolves win. And the same goes for the Human Deck.<br/><br/>Each card has a special effect when it is revealed: some of these effects shrink decks or swap them around, others let players peek at cards, and still others kill off pesky Vampires and Werewolves!<br/><br/>",

If another player lands on the same hiding space that you occupy, then you are captured and have to move to your capture box. If you move all the way around the neighborhood you can try to jump to the center and free all of your captured tokens! There are two ways to win this game, either be the first to capture all of your opponent&rsquo;s tokens before they capture yours or be the first to jump all your tokens to the center. A very easy game to learn and also very addictive for younger players who it is designed for.<br/><br/>",

There you and your fellow lab workers have been tasked with studying a parasitic alien organism found frozen deep in the Arctic ice.  To everyone's horror, the specimen turns up missing and anyone could be the infectious Creature's host!  As a Human, try to reveal the Creature's identity before it infects everyone and escapes the quarantine.<br/><br/>GOAL The Humans, represented by the Immune, must identify and eliminate the Creature before the Creature and his Infected outnumber them.<br/><br/>GAMEPLAY The game is meant to be played over a weeks time, or roughly one day for every one person playing the game.<br/><br/>On the first day each person is dealt an Identity card from the deck, two of which must be the Creature and the Immune.  The person who draws the Immune must immediately reveal their Identity to the group, whereas everyone else keeps their Identity a secret.<br/><br/>Once the Identities have been established, and the Immune has revealed themselves to the group, the game officially begins.  At this point everyone is free to go about their business.  Now the Creature begins his mission.  Once a day, including the first, the Creature may approach one of the other players, shake their hand, and state &quot;You have been Infected&quot; to convert them to the Creature's side.  The Creature may only do this once per day, but doing so will increase their numbers, and ultimately bring the Infected closer to victory.<br/><br/>On each day following the first, the group will get back together for a few moments to discuss what has happened since they last met.  After everyone has had an opportunity to speak, they will collectively vote on who they think the Creature is.  The person with the most votes against them must reveal their Identity and are eliminated from the game.  The Creature and any of his Infected are still part of the voting process, because as far as anyone else knows they are Human.<br/><br/>The Humans win if the can eliminate the Creature during the vote. If the Immune is eliminated however, the Creature and his Infected are victorious.<br/><br/>FINAL The Creature should be played with at least 8 people, and playing with more people is almost always a better experience.  The game includes other unique Identities, in addition to the Immune and Creature, that may be added to the game for more fun and chaos.<br/><br/>",

Play as one of the main leather manufacturing companies and grow from a simple workshop to a leading factory.<br/><br/>Each player begins the game by selecting one of Ubrique's most famous factories. All players begin as modest workshops with a limited workforce. At the start of each turn, two 'market' cards are placed on the board. You may find either an 'order' or an 'event'. Events happen automatically and you will have to follow the instructions on them. As for orders, you may pick one out and begin manufacturing for top international fashion brands. On order cards you'll find how many handbags and wallets need to be made and how much you'll be getting paid when delivered. The bigger the order, the more workforce you'll need. The solution is hiring external workshops. But be careful! There's only a limited amount of workshops in Ubrique, so make sure they're not manufacturing for other players!<br/><br/>Also, in order to manufacture handbags and wallets you'll be purchasing real leather tokens! The more packages you buy, the lower the cost. It's up to you to decide how much you're willing to invest.<br/><br/>Given your limited starting funds and factory size, it's always a good idea to start off with small orders. As the game goes on you'll be able to expand your factory and increase your workforce, requiring less external workshops to complete small orders and making it possible to pick up bigger orders.<br/><br/>In the advanced rules, players may negotiate with each other, trade leather, and share orders - just like in real life.<br/><br/>'El Rey de la Piel' is an educational game that faithfully reflects the leather goods industry, where victory depends mostly on business strategy than luck.<br/><br/>The goal of the game is to expand your factory to the highest level and become the leading factory in Ubrique.<br/><br/>",

Because it includes its own reference cards, this is playable with or without the Zverograd expansion.  It is available for purchase by Elite members of Paolo Parente's Dust website.<br/><br/>From the website description:<br/><br/>We are very proud to introduce our first Elite Exclusive item: Koshka and her own walker Grand'Ma. They are both presented here in their &ldquo;Night Ops&rdquo; version, used during many special operations in all parts of the world where the SSU is present. Koshka is the most active and successful SMERSH operative ever. Many of the SSU bold operations have been made possible thanks to her and the skills she has piloting her very own war machine.<br/><br/>As you can see this &ldquo;Elite Version&rdquo; comes with a special diorama base that can also serve as a playing base for Grand'Ma (it takes one space on the field). The walker can also be placed on a regular grey round base that we have magnetized: you can swap Grand'Ma from one base to another with ease.<br/>We also magnetized Koshka: she can be played independently, the rock under her feet is the same size as a regular base. And thanks to the magnet she can be placed back on the large base with her robot with instantly. In an instant Koshka and Grand'Ma can go from a Collector Item to being fully playable. And of course, as usual, everything is already painted and you can enjoy it as soon as you open the box.<br/><br/>This particular pose of the KV47, on which Grand'Ma is based on, has been specifically created by a good friend of Dust Studio: Italian modeler Livio Emanueli. He has taken the time to help Vincent create this unique model for you during his last visit in our production facility in China.<br/><br/>Of course these two models come with their very own unit cards, but these are stat and skill wise identical to the regular Dust Tactics version.<br/><br/>",

The game will start with both players choosing who picks the first character, that person starts on defense, the other play, on offense. Then, they both take turns choosing characters until they both have 12 card decks to play with. Each character shall feature its own art work and class, as well as one, two, or three attacks to use while on offense,and one or two defense moves while on defense. At the beginning of each turn, both players draw 3 characters from the top of the deck, and put one on the battlefield, and the other two on the bottom of his/her deck. Then, the player on offense may use his characters attack skills on his/her opponent's characters. If the hit lands successfully, the character is defeated. The game is over,and the winner decided, when one player has lost all of his characters and is labeled the loser.<br/><br/>",

It's not the case for the very efficient &ldquo;Nordwind&rdquo;, officially know as Sd.Kfz 234/1. Its missions have remained the same for a few years now: recon and engage light armored targets. This vehicle does these two jobs superbly.<br/><br/>With the &ldquo;Nordwind&rdquo; Dust Studio is proud to introduce its new line: DUSTIFIED KITS. As usual with our Premium line these are carefully assembled and painted, and everything you see is there: the weathering, the pilot, etc. These new vehicles will add an amazing historical touch to your armies.<br/><br/>The Premium Edition models are not just &ldquo;pre-painted&rdquo;.

The rules of this game are very simple, it can be learned in 1-2 minutes.<br/><br/>Snake Clash is a line-drawing game. The goal is to create the longest snakes. The winner is who has the highest total length of his/her 4 snakes at the end of the game. Each player can start one snake from each side of the play-field (from one of the four larger circles). One snake from left, one snake from above, one snake from right and one snake from below (4 snakes in total.)<br/><br/>Player's turn comes after each other. Player rolls a die, that determines the allowed direction(s) of his/her next line-segment. (There is a compass on the play-field that shows the directions associated to die-roll.) He/she can extend one of their snakes by a new line-segment. (Or start a new one, if he/she doesn't started 4 snakes yet.)<br/>Snakes can't cross each other and can't touch the same point on the play-field.<br/><br/>When each player have least one finished snake (When the further lengthening is impossible.), the game changes. No more die-rolls, players can freely draw a 1-segment line to any adjacent point from the end of any of their snakes.<br/> When nobody can draw lines anymore, the game is ended. The player wins, who has the largest total line-segment number.<br/><br/>",

Chess rules apply with some exceptions: Castling is allowed but only on the King side; the placement of a reserve piece to a first row space constitutes a move, and an opponents piece can be captured if it happens to occupy that space; as in Backgammon, a doubling cube can be used for side wagers, but is not necessary for playing the game;<br/><br/>From the box: MOUNTAIN PASS CHESS has been discribed as incorporating the most revolutionary change in the rules for regular chess since the change that allowed castling.

        "description": "A fixed set Deckbuilding Game based on the upcoming iOS Card Game of the same name. War Command blends traditional elements of collectible card games with the gameplay of a tabletop strategy game. The game plays out similar to chess, with each player maneuvering their six character cards to attempt to attack and kill the enemy commander character. <br/>Players can use three actions each turn to move characters, attack with characters, or play support cards from their hand, like a spell or upgrade card. When attacking or being attacked, players can also play attack or defense cards which only affect that instance.<br/>Gameplay and Deckbuilding are both quick and easy to learn, but deep and open for exploration. The game storyline revolves around three races (the reptilian G'harrana, the technologically advanced Delylians, and the war-hardened Humans) who have fled to the same remote planet to avoid a wave of radiation that is wiping out all life in the galaxy. Their fragile civilizations, crumbling from the expense of the migration effort, are unable to maintain communications due to the planetwide frequency of magnetic storms. The units on the ground are soon isolated, and must make new allies to stay alive. This is reflected in game in that you can mix races in your decks ;)<br/>The storyline is brought to life on each and every card through the spectacular artwork of established artists like Keith Thompson and Shaun Mitchell, as well as younger talents like Austen Mengler, Ven Locklear, and more!<br/><br/>",

If successful, the rest of the players must attempt the same challenge card and beat it in as many or fewer attempts than the original player. If the player fails to beat the challenge, whoever set the challenge gains a point; if the challenge is a Double Up card, however, they gain two points.

You win by destroying all enemy castles OR units.<br/><br/>Gameplay: <br/>-The game board resembles a rectangular chess board. Players agree on a layout and arrange their castles and bonus tiles (extra attack, shields, or bonus castle damage).<br/>-Players maintain a 6-card hand from their personal deck containing units (mage, healer, knight, etc.), spells, and equipment.<br/>-On their turn, players choose 5 actions to perform (cast a spell, move a unit, attack, heal, etc...).<br/>-Part of the game is trying out different moves to find the best plan, so you decide when your move is final.<br/>-Players receive bonus spell cards when two of their units are destroyed (this balances gameplay and allows you to counter an opponent's momentum).<br/><br/>Strategy elements:<br/>-Units have strengths/weaknesses and must work as a team.<br/>-Formations help reinforce attack/defense effectiveness.<br/>-Board location and unit placement is key (e.g. &quot;Is my Knight far enough away to avoid being knocked out?&quot; &quot;Is my Archer close enough to knock out the enemy Healer?&quot;).<br/>-Unit trading: killing enemy units can leave yours exposed...is it worth the risk?<br/><br/>",

        "description": "Your goal in Sexism is to move from the doll house to the White House, with the first player to cross the finish line winning. What you win, however, depends on your gender and whether you proceed to the &quot;Man's Goal&quot; or the &quot;Woman's Goal&quot;. If you win as a woman, the game instructs others that &quot;You are now a person and must be treated as such for 24 hours&quot;; if a man, you receive a cartoon of a large thumb pushing a woman down and a declaration that &quot;Congratulations, you've won &mdash; or have you?&quot;<br/><br/>Gameplay consists mostly of drawing cards, reading the text on them (e.g., &quot;You're all for women's liberation, but nobody's going to catch YOU going to a woman doctor. Go back one step.&quot;), then moving forward or backward as dictated. Some cards require the active player to act out a role, then others guess who or what the player was trying to be.<br/><br/>The game rules suggest playing as the opposite gender &quot;because this can cause some hilarious role-playing situations&quot;.<br/><br/>",

Once the voyage is over, it's what we wait for, the Divvying of the loot!<br/><br/>In Divvy, you take the role of pirates on a voyage. Each round is a voyage to obtain loot for the crew.

The solution? Pick a few cards in your hand and try your best not to play them; move populations to those cities (we could call them...um...refuge cities) and try to avoid destroying them.<br/><br/>The only problem is, sometimes you can't help but play those cards. If you're not careful, you'll wind up sacking one of your own refuge cities. Pay close attention to what your opponents are doing and try to avoid their disastrous card plays. Or better yet, try to secretly benefit from the moves they make: figure out their refuge cities, and save those cards in your own hand!<br/><br/>The deck also includes six Hero cards, which are shuffled throughout; you can play them on an opponent's turn to prevent the disaster they were trying to deploy. When the third Hero appears, the game is over and you score your points. It sounds cool, but the Heroes may actually just enslave us all--because isn't that the inevitable flow of power evolving in a post-apocalyptic wasteland anyway? ISN'T IT ALL POINTLESS?<br/><br/>",

With Hounds of War Mk. II you will be able to pit World War II Nazi Storm Troopers against your favorite Goblin Hoards, or even Star Wars&copy; Storm Troopers!<br/><br/>This is a stand-alone set of rules, so no other rules are necessary for play. In addition,  you WILL need your own miniatures, a LOT of 10-sided dice (d10), marking chits, 3D terrain, rulers marked in inches, and your imagination to play this game.<br/><br/>Instead of being a &quot;you-go-I-go&quot; turn sequence, an initiative deck is used  and cards assigned to individual units to determine when units perform actions are performed in a turn. This creates a fast paced game in which players are constantly active.<br/><br/>Hounds of War Mk. II is the culmination of many post convention evaluations, fan suggestions, and clarifications. Inside you will find many clarified and expanded rules, as well as prebuilt armies, a campaign system suggestion, a victory point system, counter sheets, and much more.

Players will fire Radiation cards at their Specimens, and depending on what combinations of Radiation they're exposed to, Specimens will turn into one of two unique Mutants. Some Mutants are hyper aggressive, others have defense mechanisms, and some manipulate the way you or your opponent can play the game! You collect Research Points at the start of each turn for every Mutant you have in play, and the first player to 5 points wins.<br/><br/>Players mutate their Specimens by firing one of three kinds of Radiation, (Alpha, Beta, and Gamma Rays) at their Specimen cards. Each Specimen card comes with a unique ingredient list called &quot;mutation requirements.&quot; Alone, Radiation cards give perks to the Specimen such as boosting their Power or Stability. Whenever a Specimen has met one of its mutation requirements, they would mutate into the corresponding Mutant card, which would wait outside of play until this moment.<br/><br/>Apart from Specimens and Mutants, player can build Devices like the Electric Coil and the Transmogrifier, or use Procedures like Brainstorm and Devolution. Lab Assistants like the Medic, Technician, and Researcher can lend their talents to you throughout the game as well.

One of the Kings Champions!<br/><br/>Labyrintheus is a brand new dungeon survival card game that introduces a unique Persona Card System where you compete against you fellow party members to defeat Monsters and Avoid Traps while collecting Gate Stones.  Gate Stones are used to activate the portal to the outside world.<br/><br/>One of the things that makes Labyrintheus unique is the persona card system.  When you chose a character to play, you will have their persona card.  More of a tile than a card, you use this for your inventory system and to track your health.  Treasure cards collected in Labyrintheus are equipped by placing them along the appropriate edges of the persona card.  And once you die, flip the persona card over to reveal your stats and abilities as an undead servant of the King.  If you can't win, why should anyone else?!?<br/><br/>",

Mastering botNET requires careful planning, strategy, and a touch of game theory.<br/><br/>The game is broken into five actions where Hackers: <br/><br/>     Scan the Internet (draw deck) to download new Nodes (cards), <br/>     Connect the nodes to the network on the table<br/>     Mine encryption keys that can unlock new Nodes<br/>     Hack nodes by moving an Avatar to the node and using the keys. <br/>     Recruit &lsquo;whitehat&rsquo; or &lsquo;blackhat&rsquo; hackers to your side.     <br/><br/><br/>Each Node has a Type which determines what it does as well as a security level that shows how hard it is to hack and where in the network it is allowed to go.<br/><br/>Each node type is associated with a shape:<br/><br/>     Miners (Triangle) -  Computers that crunch numbers to generate encryption keys. <br/>     Storage (Square) - Databases that store nodes or encryption keys.<br/>     Applications (Circle) - Programs that enhance specific actions. <br/>     Botnets (Hexagon)- Hackers earn street cred by connecting new nodes to these networks. <br/><br/><br/>The color of a Node determines its Security Level:<br/><br/>     Home (Blue) nodes are small systems owned by individuals.<br/>     Commercial (Green) nodes belong to small and medium businesses. <br/>     Cloud (Orange) nodes are located in the data centers of giant multinational corporations. <br/>     Government (Red) nodes belong to a national Government and are very difficult to hack. <br/><br/><br/>Cards in the network must respect the security levels. For instance, Home nodes may never be directly connected to Cloud or Government Nodes without a Commercial Node in between.<br/><br/>A hidden war is being waged between two hacker groups: the Freedom Foundation, whose membership includes altruistic Whitehat hackers, and the Cracker Coalition, which is made up of ruthless Blackhat Hackers.<br/><br/>Street credit, or &ldquo;Cred&rdquo; is a crucial currency in the Hacker world. In botNET it is represented by White or Black glass tokens that indicate if the Cred is &lsquo;Whitehat&rsquo; or &lsquo;Blackhat&rsquo;. Connecting nodes to Botnets earn Cred from one of the two hacker groups. One earned, Cred can be used to the Hackers advantage by acquiring contacts and issuing exploits. <br/> Contacts are shadowy individuals that will assist you but may switch allegiances at the drop of a hat. Contacts have secret knowledge that can make hacks easier and will pay you if you can gain control over the Nodes they desire. Unscrupulous rivals may turn informant and report Contacts to the police. Who will keep their mouth shut and who will rat?<br/><br/>",

Sit yourself down for a fast and furious game of zombie dominance!<br/><br/>In this game each player takes the role of a shambling and hungry zombie, trying their best to get to the front of the zombie horde where they&rsquo;ll have the best chance at a juicy bite from one of those still living. Each zombie player will do their best to rid themselves of other nearby zombies (game cards) by pushing them back or foisting them onto other zombie players.<br/><br/>The first player to break away from the horde by discarding all of their cards wins! Play begins with the player to the left of the dealer. That player must play one card into a central pile. This card will be one of four suits: Hearts, Splatters, Biohazards or Palms. This card determines which suit will be the active suit. The first player ends their turn by drawing cards from their draw pile until they have 5 cards in their hand.<br/><br/>If a player cannot play a card of the same suit as the active suit, they must pick up all of the cards in the central pile and place them on the bottom of their draw pile, ending their turn.<br/><br/>Each card has also has a number on it. If a player has 2, 3 or 4 of a kind, which includes a card with the active suite, they may play all of these cards. The card with the active suit must be played last so that the active suit is still the top card on the central pile.<br/><br/>If a player ever has all 5 cards in their hand with the same suit (i.e. all biohazard), on their turn they may place all five cards on the central pile and then draw five cards (if possible) into their hand.<br/><br/>The first player to discard all of their cards in their draw pile and hand has successfully outdistanced the horde and wins! Watch out for Infected cards though, they're hard to get rid of!<br/><br/>Zombies: Infection: Each deck of Zombies: Shambling and Hungry comes with 20 Infected cards. They are used to infect your friends, who in turn can and should infect other friends! Use as many Infected cards as there are players. One person becomes Patient Zero, and starts off with 8 Infected cards. They then try to infect others! A the start of the game, only Patient Zero can infect other players. All players should agree on a time limit for the game &ndash; it can be an hour or until the end of an event<br/><br/>",

        "description": "In CIA Sniper, you are a newly trained agent specializing in sniper ops. Your new job is to work with foreign <br/>agencies and travel the globe tracking down International Terrorists, Drug leaders, Dictators, Assassins, and <br/>all-around bad people. You are given a steady stream of contracts to develop your skills and earn money. In <br/>the beginning you will travel the globe accepting the easier contracts for quick cash and skill development. <br/>As your skills increase you can accept more difficult contracts which will earn you even more money and skill <br/>points. Each contract provides specific locations and target parameters that will take you across the globe<br/>into different cities, earning huge payoffs for success and more aggressive tactics from Enemy agents. Don't <br/>stay in a specific city too long or these enemy agents will track you down and try to capture you. <br/>Each new contract will confront you with many decisions: what type of weather will you have to deal with, <br/>how long do you have to complete the contract, what location will the shot take place at and how much will <br/>you earn when the contract is completed. <br/>With the completion of each contract, you will earn money and valuable skill points which you can apply to <br/>the six skill sets to help increase your abilities to become a proficient sniper. As you fulfill contracts you <br/>become more of a threat and more enemy agents seek you out. If you stay alive long enough and don&rsquo;t get <br/>caught, you will eventually complete enough contracts and earn enough money to become the greatest sniper <br/>in the CIA<br/><br/>",

Once all of the players' Hustlers are placed, each player, in turn, then activates one space and performs the actions which that space allows. Each corner allows players to sell one drug based on the icon shown, and may roll the Dope Dice (3 custom dice) in which depict a different drug on 4 faces (Weed, Meth, Coke, Heroin), a wild card on the fifth face, and finally, an arrest warrant on the sixth. For each face rolled players may sell one matching drug token.<br/><br/>If 2 gangs occupy a corner, the person who activates the corner initiates a robbery. No matter who wins, someone's going to the Emergency room, with one Beat Down token for each opposing Hustler that robbed him.<br/><br/>At the beginning of each round, a card is drawn and has either a persistent effect which lasts the entire round or a one time effect, as well as that night's prices to buy and sell drugs.<br/><br/>At the end of a set amount of rounds, the richest gang wins.<br/><br/>",

They can be revealed to activate abilities, surprise with counter effects, and to gain additional movement points via force marching. Each round consists of players taking turns commanding their units and armies with a limited number of command tokens. At the end of the round all units that have not been commanded are flipped face down and are considered rested again. Play continues until one player captures a majority of an opponent&rsquo;s units or captures their king.<br/><br/>",

        "description": "Avast Ye, Matey!  The song has been sung!  The Pirate lord has called for a gathering at his stronghold to elect a successor. It could be you. All that is needed is for you to answer the calling and bring your ships and crew to the stronghold. But beware, there are pirates everywhere. And what pirate can resist an easy treasure, even if it is already on your ship? There are merchant ships to raid but be watchful of the Royal Navy. Be the pirate with the most prestige at the end and you are unanimously elected the pirate king. That is the pirate rule. He who has the most gold makes the rules.<br/><br/>Overview:<br/>Pursue and Plunder is a strategy game for 2 to 4 players. Each player controls 4 pirate ships in an alcove of 9 islands which each hold various artifacts, items and gold. The players will plunder the islands, establish strongholds and attack merchant ships and each other in order to gain the most prestige. Players also have to avoid the Royal Navy that is patrolling the alcove. The game is played in rounds and at the start of each round each player distributes 7 crew tokens (4 regular crew, 2 drunken sailors, 1 captain) on their game mat secretly behind a player screen. Once all players are ready the screens are removed. Each player then takes 2 actions to move, attack opponents or plunder islands. The success of the actions depend on how the player distributed their crew tokens for the round. Artifact items and experience tokens provide additional flexibility to the actions being performed. At the end of the round, players may upgrade<br/>their cannons and sails, establish strongholds, and train crew to improve their chance of success in future rounds. Players are competing to be the first player to earn a set number of prestige points depending on the number of players. Prestige points are earned by finding artifacts, collecting gold, establishing strongholds and defeating merchants and the Royal Navy.<br/><br/>",

Some say the Niantic was smuggling Opium out of China and Indonesia but while that may have been a side deal worked out for its journey home, the merchant vessel Niantic docked in Whampoa Harbor and unloaded a precious cargo.<br/><br/>A relic, uncovered during an archeological dig hundreds of years earlier, was transported to Whampoa Harbor and buried there.<br/><br/>The relic laid buried in the area that later became known as Whampoa Garden until approximately 150 years later, when in 1999, Liu Fan excavated it and working in combination with a group of international researchers, went to work unlocking its secrets.<br/><br/>Ingress: The Relic casts up to six researchers in roles to unlock the undiscovered power of exotic matter.  Researchers take turns placing portal tiles on the relic board and activating them with resonator tokens.  Connecting three fully activated portal tiles can lead to an even greater power by creating a control field.<br/><br/>Gameplay:<br/>The game plays out on a grid-based board with tiles in a manner somewhat reminiscent of Go or Chinese Checkers.  Winners use a combination of action cards and tile placement to earn action points.  The player to first reach 50 action points or the player with the most action points at the end of 10 rounds wins.<br/><br/>",

        "description": "Archer: Fast and Loose is a free print-and-play card game of insults, getting the upper hand, unfortunate phrasing and &quot;sploosh&quot; based on the hit TV show Archer.<br/><br/>Each game round is comprised of two phases: the ISIS Phase and the Missions Phase.  In the ISIS Phase, players secretly choose a room in the ISIS intelligence agency building to move to, with each room conferring a different bonus to the players located there.  During the Missions Phase, players vie to get placed on and then succeed at their preferred mission, with each mission requiring different skill sets, such as Smarts, Guns, Booze and even Sex!<br/><br/>Each player also has a deck of Agent cards characterising one of the main personalities from the show, with different wacky and zany take-that effects for each: have players shout &quot;woo-hoo!&quot; when they join a mission due to Cheryl's &quot;Boarding Party&quot;, or have the Sterling player play with his fingers in his ears thanks to his cruel mistress, Tinnitus.<br/><br/>Through succeeding at missions and playing cards, players can gain Sploosh, and the player with the most Sploosh at the end of the game wins!<br/><br/>",

Be careful, night brings Cannibals.<br/><br/>Collect food, resources, weapons and tools while you fight (or flee) for your life in the Cooperative (or Solo) Survival Game.<br/><br/>In this epic survival game you play the role of a crash survivor who washed up on a beautiful island. Without food or water you need to collect food, build tools, craft weapons and gather stones for an SOS sign. I mean, how else is rescue going to find you?<br/><br/>While wondering the island you learn a few things, food is scarce, resources and equipment are hard to come by and nothing is what it seems.<br/><br/>As night falls and a breathtaking sunset fills the sky, a weird mist seems to roll in off the coast. From the mist you see these things emerge. Human like figures stagger, crawl and sprint towards you. You don't know what you are about to face, do you fight or flee?<br/><br/>Game Play<br/><br/>Players take turns moving their pawns around the island and using action points. They use these points to collect food and resources. Using a crafting system you can make weapons and tools to help you survive.<br/><br/>The game is played over the course of a Day and Night rounds. In the day rounds, You can wonder freely, but when night comes around, your actions are limited as well as your movement. With the setting sun, you will also start spawning numerous Cannibals around the island on specifically designated spawning locations.<br/><br/>You can either fight Cannibals by rolling die, or run around them. By day break, cannibals will disappear into the forests until next night fall. As you finish your SOS sign, the island and cannibals will become more aggressive. Get off the island quick, but don't leave yourself vulnerable.<br/><br/>The goal of the game is to get off the island alive and with as many people as possible. It is possible to be left behind, but the game is easier if you work together.<br/><br/>",

Win enough Electoral College votes to become the next President of the United States. Careful campaign planning and management of campaign funds is required to defeat your opponent. Conduct polls to discover which candidate each state favors. Be sure to read the Daily News card and watch out for the &quot;Dark Horse&quot; candidate that can steal your Volunteers.<br/><br/>To play Election, players first decide on how many &ldquo;days&rdquo; there are to the election, with each round of play being one turn.  On each turn players can either Fundraise or Campaign. When campaigning, players can spend money to recruit volunteers, hire consultants, buy ads, travel, or conduct a poll.  Volunteers, consultants and ads can be traded in for Votes, which are then placed on individual states.  Each state also has a &ldquo;poll&rdquo;, which determines which party the state favors (e.g. Republicans +3). Players can pay to conduct polls to see the polling information. On Election Day, the outcome in each state is determined by the votes placed on the state plus the polling. The winner of each state is awarded all of the Electoral College Votes for that state. The winner of the election is the player with the most Electoral College Votes.<br/><br/>Election is fun for the whole family and will have your children jumping up and down thrilled to have just become the next President of the United States.<br/><br/>",

AEROSTAR is an easy to learn yet dynamic game. Do you have what it takes to hire, invest, and build the best airline? If so you will be crowned the next AEROSTAR. Let the bidding begin!!!<br/><br/>Players start a round of play by bidding to hire an executive for their airline. All Executives are not made equal so choose accordingly. Then each player has an opportunity to invest in airline tech stocks, fuel stocks, or several other money making opportunities. This segment is also bidding based so budget wisely or your opponents might outbid you and steal your investment opportunity.<br/><br/>Next Players buy their Airplane Fleets. This segment is Auction/Bidding based also. There are 4 airline tech companies providing 30 different fleet types, all with different money making abilities and fuel efficiencies. After this, Players must buy fleet fuel from the market in order for their fleets to operate. This market price is constantly changing so be careful when building your airline fleet or you might lose money.<br/><br/>Players then have the opportunity to buy Terminals in Major and Minor Cities in a start to creating their Airline Empire. By creating connections players earn money if their fleet can fulfill the connections and have the fuel to do so. Each round ends with connection and investment profits being paid.<br/><br/>A yearly market card is drawn that effects the next rounds game play. In AEROSTAR there are market fuel increases, Union Strikes, and many more global impacts. You never know what might happen in the adventure of becoming the next AEROSTAR.<br/><br/>",

The dragons have done what they can to slow the process but the humans bred like rabbits and the other races weren&rsquo;t much better. It didn&rsquo;t take long for the inevitable conflict over resources to begin and the dragons soon realized that they didn&rsquo;t stand a chance against the combined strength of the new races. Those dragons that survived are now forced to fight amongst themselves for food, a home, breeding grounds and anything else they want. They have taken to the skies to battle it out with others of their kind, knowing only the strongest amongst them will survive to become the lords of the skies.<br/><br/>Players take on the role of Dragons as they battle against one another in the skies over Erien. Their old sense of pride and self-importance mean that they must have the best feeding grounds available even if it means fighting other dragons to get it.<br/><br/>The game uses a system where at the start of each turn the players plot out their dragon&rsquo;s movement for the turn. Movement is truly 3D allowing the dragons to fly up, down, left, right or any combination of directions. Elevation is tracked with stacking tiles and turns are shown with angled tilt blocks. Then with a bit of luck as their plans unfold on the game map their plans will have put them in to a better position to strike either with breath weapon or claw.<br/><br/>",

This game focuses on the small unit tactics used by fire teams and infantry squads emphasizing their differing weapons, training and determination. The unique mechanics in WWII Assault make it an intense action oriented game in which the battle can change in an instant.<br/><br/>Each player typically controls a squad or several squads of infantry. Each figure in WWII Assault is individually based and represents a single soldier that can perform independent actions from the rest of the squad.<br/><br/>WWII Assault is designed to allow players to recreate any small scale engagements from the first battles in Poland, throughout the European Theatre and into the last days of Berlin.<br/><br/>The WWII Assault Field Kit is a digest sized tri-fold rules booklet with an interior pocket that is packed with all the rules, weapon sheets, squad cards and more that you need to get started playing the game. There are two scenarios included in the Field Kit and more will be added to our website along with squad creation rules.<br/><br/>Players may use any scale of figures (suggested figure sizes range from: 15mm to 54mm) in their collection.<br/><br/>With the basic rules kept to under 5 pages, WWII Assault is quick and easy to learn and yet it offers:<br/><br/><br/>    A unique card-based initiative system that changes each turn.<br/>    A game system where higher skilled soldiers fire better than lesser skilled soldiers.<br/>    A game system where the differences between weapons not only exist but they are integral to the game.<br/>    A game system that can be realistically and enjoyably used in any squad level scenario from WWII.<br/>    A game system that tracks multiple levels of wounds, morale, suppression and other unit impairing conditions on the battlefield.<br/><br/><br/>All this and more in an intense action oriented game where a single soldier can bring you total victory or drive you towards defeat.<br/><br/>",

The board game is designed to be easily printed on 8.5&rdquo;x11&rdquo; paper or cardstock (or A4, for those not in the USA). You will need two regular decks of cards and dice (which you can find at almost any dollar store) for a night of sexy vampire fun with your partner. Fangs optional.<br/><br/>There are two major aspects to gameplay. The first aspect to the gameplay are the individual rooms (setup something like Clue). There are six rooms, each with a different theme. Within the rooms, players perform sexual or erotic tasks in order to earn poker cards. At the end of the game, the player with the best poker hand wins (although, if played correctly, both players really win ;) )<br/><br/>The second aspect of gameplay is the movement from one room to another. Players don't just move, they must perform various foreplay acts in order to successfully move their game piece.<br/><br/>",

Players play starter cards to earn Coins and buy better cards from the Game stacks. They can also use Coins to Score on the Games.  Each player attempts to fill up a High Score table to take control of that game before an opponent can do the same. Once a player takes control of a stack, other players can't touch it.  The winner is the first player to control 3 games.<br/><br/>The Raster Red set is tuned for fast action and features pixel based, raster screen, retro arcade goodness!

In the adventure they will find objects that help and enemies with which to fight. In turn, the great and almost invincible dragon roams throughout the kingdom seeking to steal sheep and take them to their cave.<br/><br/>The aim of the players is to recover the sheep, bring them back and avoid at all costs the dragon, though, if some brave shepherd manages to defeat the dragon in combat, it will be consecrated the great savior and win the game immediately.<br/>If no defeat the dragon, the pastor with more points (for accumulation of sheep) has wins.<br/><br/>The game mechanics are simple, each turn pastors must perform two actions, move and look. To move roll a die (1d4), after completing its movement they can search the area where it is located and there, stealing a card from the appropriate deck as the area will reveal your search. The areas investigated can not be investigated in the future. In his search you will find objects, events, enemies and sheep. Every sheep has a value in coins (VPs), the pastor must take the sheep back to the castle to win the reward.<br/><br/>As a bonus action, if a pastor result is an 1 in movement (as in the Talisman), after completing their actions must &quot;activate&quot; the dragon.<br/>When the exploration markers are finished, or when the dragon is defeated, the game ends.<br/><br/>",

        "description": "Mountain Rummy is based on classic draw and discard Rummy style play which melds elements of Rummy 500 and Gin Rummy, along with many fresh play elements to create a game that strives to be more skill based and less luck based than other Rummy based games.  Players will find that it's a poor idea to form a static strategy, since an opponent will undermine any one strategy if performed too often, creating a need for constantly adjusting strategy incorporating math, gambits, psychology and many other elements.  Created by the strategy board game loving couple Keith and Luci Medlock, Mountain Rummy was designed to replace more complex strategy games while mountaineering with only a single pack of cards, a laminated instruction sheet and dry erase marker!<br/><br/>Here are the official rules:<br/><br/>MOUNTAIN RUMMY (2 Players &amp; Standard Deck)<br/><br/>Deadwood: Non-melded cards in hand.<br/><br/>Card Values: A=1 or 14 (Deadwood=14), 2-10=Face Value, Jack=11, Q=12, K=13, &amp; Joker=Wild (Deadwood=15).  Suits rank in alphabetical order, Spades high.<br/><br/>Deal: Jr player shuffles, Sr cuts &amp; Jr deals 1 card to Sr, then self.  High card deals.  Dealer shuffles, non-dealer cuts &amp; 13 cards are dealt from top of deck in alternating fashion to form hands, starting w/ non-dealer.  1 card is dealt face up from top of deck to form discard pile &amp; rest of deck is placed face down to form stock pile.<br/><br/>Set: 3 or 4 same value cards.<br/><br/>Run: &ge;3 same suit cards w/ sequential value.<br/><br/>Meld: Set or Run placed face up in your play area.  Joker can&rsquo;t make run w/ duplicate cards &amp; melded value can&rsquo;t be changed.<br/><br/>Layoff: Placing card that adds to either player&rsquo;s existing meld face up in your play area.  If laying off on opponent&rsquo;s melds, their melds may be reorganized.<br/><br/>Draw: Taking top card of stock pile or any card from discard pile.  If discard pile card is drawn, it may not be discarded the same turn.  If discard pile card other than topmost is drawn, any cards above it must be taken &amp; it must be melded/laid off that turn.  <br/> Discard: Placing 1 card face up on top of discard pile, ensuring each lower card&rsquo;s value is visible.<br/><br/>Knock: Discarding face down w/ Deadwood &le; 10.  Opponent may meld/layoff before scoring.<br/><br/>Base Camp: Discarding face down w/ 0 Deadwood (10 pt bonus).<br/><br/>High Camp: Melding/laying off all cards in hand (20 pt bonus).<br/><br/>Play: Non-dealer plays first.  Turn begins w/ a draw, then melding/laying off (optional) &amp; ends with a discard.  You may end hand by Knocking, Base/High Camp.<br/><br/>Undercut: Non-knocking player&rsquo;s Deadwood &le; knocking player&rsquo;s &amp; value of melds/layoffs &ge; knocking player&rsquo;s (30 pt bonus).<br/><br/>Summit: Ending hand w/ Base/High Camp w/o melding/laying off on previous turns (40 pt bonus).<br/><br/>Scoring: Standard pts awarded to players for value of cards in their melds/layoffs, less Deadwood.  Player w/ most standard pts wins hand &amp; deals next.  Bonus points transfer to winner.  Add all pts for each player to their previous total. Game won by hand winner w/ final score of &ge;1000.<br/><br/>",

        "description": "Treachery on the high seas!<br/><br/>Weigh anchor and set sail in this strategic pirate game that puts you at the helm as you race to bring home the most treasure.<br/><br/>The Golden Age of piracy was no time for a weak captain. Pirates needed fast ships, strong enough to withstand a barrage of cannon fire. Tradeoffs between strength and speed, often times, weighed heavily in the outcome of battles. In the quest for riches, pirates would seek to plunder hidden treasures and the ill-gotten gains of other captains. Treachery, betrayal, and danger beset even the most cunning captain. Do you have what it takes to command your ship and pillage enough doubloons to claim victory?<br/><br/>Scourge of the Seven Seas is a competitive or cooperative game for one to six players, each commanding a pirate ship on the high seas. Captains travel in search of hidden treasure and ship upgrades while fending off attacks and bribery attempts. The first captain to claim twenty points of treasure wins!<br/><br/>The object of Scourge of the Seven Seas is to be the first player to deliver twenty points or more of treasure to their home port. You score points by taking turns moving your pawn between home port and an island full of buried treasures. At the start of the game you are dealt five cards which you use to determine the initial speed and strength of your ship.<br/><br/>On your turn you may search for treasure, deliver treasure to your home port, draw cards at a trade port, attack other ships, or attempt to bribe dock workers. As the game progresses, players may visit trading ports to draw additional cards to increase their ship stats. You can attack other player&rsquo;s ships to plunder their riches or discard cards to bribe disloyal dock workers and steal the treasures at their home port. Attacking can be risky as you might become the victim; whereas sneaking into a home port and bribing would best be done with a fast ship for your escape.<br/><br/>There are many different strategies to win competitively. The goal in team or single player mode is for at least one player to gain twenty or more points of treasure before Davy Jones releases the Kraken. Each player chooses a ship from a fleet of six different ships (Galleon, Frigate, Man O&rsquo; War, Schooner, Corvette, or Sloop) with varying abilities. In cooperative mode, you and your team must do battle with Davy Jones as he tries to block you from delivering treasures.  All the while, a doom clock counts down to Davy Jones becoming strong enough to release the Kraken on your team.<br/><br/>",

McClellan&rsquo;s steady advance up the James Peninsula threatened the Confederate capital of Richmond, and a Union victory here had the potential of ending the war. A massive fleet of powerful Union warships anchored the northern army&rsquo;s flank and protected their water-borne supply line.<br/><br/>On March 8th a strange looking Confederate steam ship, one that looked like a floating barn roof to a Union sailor who witnessed it, accompanied by other more conventional Confederate warships, sallied forth to do battle. The CSS Virginia, an ironclad warship built on the hull of the captured USS Merrimac, proved impervious to cannon balls fired from the Union warships and nearby land artillery batteries. Victory seemed within the Confederate&rsquo;s grasp when action ended on March 8th, leaving two Union warships sinking and another badly damaged, with only slight damage to the Confederate vessels.<br/><br/>The fighting resumed on March 9th, but the Union ironclad USS Monitor had arrived during the night and its commander intercepted the CSS Virginia when it steamed out for battle. The battle between these two ironclad warships was violent, but ended in stalemate, and the Confederate&rsquo;s ambitions were thwarted.<br/>Although inconclusive in military terms, this first fight between ironclad warships marked a decisive turning point in naval warfare.<br/><br/>",

        "description": "Nafetel: Merchants is a unique game where players will compete against each other to fill quotas from shipmasters eager to get back out on the sea.<br/><br/>In Nafetel: Merchants each player will play through a set of rounds in which they trade, bid, invest, gain victory points, and more. Each player has four sets of these rounds to fill however many quotas they possibly can then the shipmasters will leave with what they have or empty. This is called the ticking time bomb, where Shipmasters and Merchants alike both want the best deals in the quickest time possible.<br/><br/>Players will draw 4 Investment cards to begin the game, after that a specific number of quota cards will be placed in the middle of the players. Each player will play their rounds separate from the other players. They will decide if they wish to invest, bid, and/or trade their investments for new ones or invest them on quotas. The first player to fill a quota through either monopolising it, out bidding it, or quickly snagging it off the market will gain a victory point for that quota the filled.<br/><br/>",

        "description": "Vegetable Race is a racing game with varying point values given for finishing.  Your primary goal is to manipulate your neighbors to finish based on your secret objective.  Vegetable Race is played over multiple rounds and is anyone's game until the final round.<br/><br/>Game Play:<br/>Each player selects a vegetable from the eight available (Carrot, Tomato, Bean, Pepper, Eggplant, Onion, Corn, and Lettuce) and takes the appropriate vegetable card and player pieces.<br/>At the start of each race, each player is given a secret objective and dealt 2 playing cards.  The secret objectives relate to yourself or your neighbors finishing, i.e.: &quot;Finish any time after the person to your right. 3 pts&quot;, or &quot;Finish Last. 4 pts.&quot;<br/><br/>On a players turn they draw a card then play a card.  Or, they can use their vegetables ability.  Cards move themselves or other players.  Cards also allow you to play from another players hand, swap places, and more.  <br/>There is a single &quot;Finish First&quot; card that gives a player 7 points if they finish first with it in their hand and causes their opponents to lose 1 point.<br/><br/>Points for finishing in each race are awarded as follows: <br/>First: 0pts<br/>Second: 4pts<br/>Last: 3pts<br/>Other: 2pts<br/><br/>So, in the span of each race, you go from not wanting to finish, wanting to finish, then not wanting to finish again.<br/><br/>The race is run on a 10 space racetrack.  After all players have finished, points are tallied on a separate score track.  Play continues until a predetermined score has been met (20 or 30 points) or number of races have been run (3 is usually a good number to determine the top vegetable).  Each race runs 5-10 minutes, more or less depending on the number of players.<br/><br/>When playing with 6-8 players additional rules and objectives are added to help speed the game along.<br/><br/>Vegetable Race Consists of: (subject to change prior to release)<br/>54 Standard poker sized playing cards (10 Secret Objective, 42 playing cards, 2 rules quick reference cards)<br/>10 Large playing cards (8 Vegetable Player cards, Race Track, and Score track)<br/>18 Molded plastic pieces (2 of each Vegetable and two additional pieces for tracking starting player with 6-8 players)<br/><br/>The vegetables used in Vegetable Race are vegetables in the culinary sense.  The designer is aware that some vegetables used are botanically fruits.  Since a lot of different colored vegetables are the same color (Onion, Leek, Bok Choy, etc.) and/or look similar (radish, turnip, beet, etc.) the designer just went with what he thought would be the most amusing (and the name Vegetable Race had a good ring to it).<br/><br/>Vegetable Race is scheduled to be released on Kickstarter right now!!!  Pledge now!  Running now until August 26th.<br/><br/>",

In Block Master, your best tactic is to collect that bad karma now and give it to your opponents to get the win. Use your Karma Crystal to block other players from moving through the positive karma path and win!<br/><br/>This 1st entry into the Karma Crystals game collection introduces many of the mechanics we use in all our games, including the Roll Off, Karma Crystals to share bad karma, monster elemental cards and dice matching, game end triggers and completion of the round prior to determining a win, playoffs using game win shards, and auto players. This game features the use of karma move and Block Trophy shards and FOUR monster elemental cards to start your collector&rsquo;s deck!<br/><br/>Roll dice to work with the various monster elemental cards - monsters are the good guys and help you win! Determine how many karma moves you score per roll and collect your karma move shards, or pass on your no-match karma to another player by attempting to block one of three possible move scores to get a blocking trophy! If you get 11 or more karma moves, that triggers the end the game and a winner is determined at the end of that round!<br/><br/>In addition to the unique dice matching game mechanic, a unique auto player system is also used to facilitate up to EIGHT total players per game. The game also provides an easy way to track multiple game wins for playoffs in case you have more than 15 to 20 minutes to play. No paper score cards and pencil needed - just move and block trophy shards to track and build your scores, and of course, Karma Crystal to track your block attempts!<br/><br/>",

Players each control a class based hero, and the game comes with 4 prearranged and unique class decks though a draft mode is also available.<br/><br/>Gameplay:<br/>The game is played on a modular hex grid map, and players use their deck of cards as their hero's abilities. Cards are used to defend your hero or to attack others, as well as special abilities.<br/><br/>The goal of the Black Sands is to be the last player or team left standing. It can be played as a free-for-all of 2-4 players, or as two teams of 2 players. Two games used together could expand the maximum amount of players up to 8, with teams allowed in any even combination (I.E. pairs, or 4v4).<br/><br/>Using a pool of &quot;energy,&quot; each round players take turns maneuvering their characters. The character pieces have hexagonal bases labeled with the characters Front, Left, and Right sides. Cards can have active effects and/or prepared effects. Players can play active effects from their hand on their turn. An example of an active effect would be &quot;The next attack you make this turn gets +2 damage.&quot; To use a card's prepared effect, a player places the card face down in one of three piles marked for their character's Front, Left, and Right sides. Prepared cards are used as interrupts for opponents actions, and will take place before the completion of the action they are responding to. A prepared effect might read something like &quot;Block the next attack against the prepared side.&quot;<br/><br/>",

        "description": "Focus On Your Karma Path And Collect Elemental Matches!<br/><br/>You can travel down life through good deeds or bad deeds, but karma will follow you either way. In Move Master, your best tactic is to collect that bad karma now and give it to your opponents to get the win.<br/><br/>This 3rd entry into the Karma Crystals game collection adds the use of elemental shards with move shards to gain movement and 12 new monster elemental cards for your collector&rsquo;s deck!<br/><br/>Your mission is to gain as many moves forward down the karma path, collect elemental shards and be nice to other opponents so they don&rsquo;t pass their Karma Crystals to you.<br/><br/>Roll dice to work with the various monster elemental cards - monsters are the good guys and help you win! Determine how many karma moves you score per roll and collect your karma move shards. Your move match also earns you an elemental shard, but if you get more of one type, you get to pass a Karma Crystal to another player. Your opponents also get Karma Crystals through a no-match roll, and you will get those too! When you get 11 or more karma moves, that triggers the end the game and the winner is determined at the end of that round!<br/><br/>In addition to the unique dice matching game mechanic, a unique auto player system is also used to facilitate up to EIGHT total players per game. The game also provides an easy way to track multiple game wins for playoffs in case you have more than 15 to 20 minutes to play. No paper score cards and pencil needed - just move and elemental shards, and of course, Karma Crystals to track and build your score!<br/><br/>",

        "description": "This game is actually a game collection. It hosts 4 games and 2 additional variants for one of them.<br/><br/>1.Yura Yura Balance Caf&eacute;<br/>This is the main game the components can be played with. You have a stack of cards that represent coffee orders, several coffee &ldquo;ingredients&rdquo; and a playing area, which is a tablet on a dome shaped foot. The name part &ldquo;balance&rdquo; comes from the way it&rsquo;s played. You draw a card from the deck which tells you, if you need to place a straight coffee, a coffee-to-go, a Milk Coffee or one of the 2 Macchiato versions on the tablet. There is a grid on said tablet to determine the places where you can, but on a coffee to go you can stack another coffee if you like. Whoever tips the tablet over loses. Besides the usual red cards, there are also green ones in the deck. These give you the opportunity to order somebody else to place the coffee (with a green cup), of course on their own risk.<br/><br/>2.Speed Order Caf&eacute;<br/>This speed game needs at least 2 baristas and 1 customer. The customer shuffles the deck of cards and pulls 5 into her hand. She than reads them aloud to the baristas. After all 5 orders are read the customer gives the start sign, and all baristas start to assemble the coffees in order. Whoever is fastest stops the game. If she is correct on all coffees she wins, otherwise the win goes to the next most complete and errorless contender.<br/><br/>3.Black and Milk Reversi<br/>This is just Othello played with the components of the game.<br/><br/>4.Coffee Cup Tower<br/>This is a stacking game were 2 or more players (Variant A/B) are stacking Black Coffee cups and Coffee-To-Go&rsquo;s as high as possible. The variants are differentiated by the footprint of the initial layer. First Player to tip the tower loses.<br/><br/>",

        "description": "Far in the future, humanity makes contact with a distant, dying alien race, the Sectridians, whose survival depends upon a constant influx of a rare substance known as primordium, found only in a remote section of an asteroid field close to the Sectridian home world. Unfortunately the Sectridians lose the ability to acquire the primordium for themselves, because the asteroids become infested with another hostile alien species, the monstrous Raptezoids and their horrific mother, the Hive Queen.<br/><br/>Encounters with the Raptezoids prove deadly to the feeble Sectridians. Thus, they are forced to abandon their primordium rich asteroids and, consequently, begin to die off. In a final desperate act, the Sectridians send a distress signal throughout the galaxy, hoping another benevolent alien race might come to their rescue. When their demise seems all but certain, a few rag-tag human factions receive the Sectridian cry for help, and, greedily sensing an opportunity to cash in on their plight, agree, for a handsome fee, to mine the Primordium for the Sectridians, battling the Raptezoid scourge in the process. These human factions also learn that, by gathering and selling specimens of the Raptezoids to a few curious members of an enigmatic scientific community sprinkled among them, they can earn a small, yet not insignificant, additional profit.<br/><br/>It is not long before the lust for wealth sends these mining factions into conflict with one another, as they each seek to claim more and more asteroids for themselves. Ordinary space miners, most often equipped with nothing more than their trusty pick-axes, have to quickly learn to become soldiers as they are sent headlong into bloody battle against the armies of other mining factions. These conflicts become known as the Primoridum Wars, and rage for several years before the Sectridians suddenly, and mysteriously, disappear.<br/><br/>You will play the leader of one these human factions. You will expand your primordium mining operations throughout the asteroid field, wage war against your opponents, fight the terrible Raptezoids, and gather Raptezoid specimens. At the end of five rounds, the player with the most wealth wins the game.<br/><br/>The Primordium Wars is a quasi 4x, tile placement, resource gathering, and worker displacement game where players place tiles representing various structures onto their asteroids in order to increase their primordium mining operations. It is also a game in which combat plays a significant, though secondary role, where players attack each other in order to claim more resource producing asteroids, or to disrupt their opponents' operations. The game takes place on a modular board where, in each round, players slowly shift the asteroids around on the game board, subtly, or often drastically, changing the strategic situation.<br/><br/>In each round, players will first acquire, in a bidding phase, tiles that represent the items needed to expand their mining empires such as: Various asteroid modules to build on the asteroids (mining facilities, orbital turrets, pulse cannons, science laboratories, etc), various starship upgrades (warp drives, sniping lasers, stealth devices, etc), miner and mercenary reinforcements, build points for building new starships, and grav technology for tethering asteroids together into clusters (a core mechanism that greatly increases mining production, and expands the functionality of most modules built on the asteroids).<br/>Players will then deploy their newly acquired items onto their asteroids and starships, take turns moving their pieces deeper into the asteroid field in order to expand their mining empire, and battle other players, Raptezoids, and the dreaded Hive Queen.<br/>At the end of each round players will collect their income from their mining operations and Raptezoid specimens, and a new round will begin.<br/><br/>",

You also get 10 new monster elemental cards for your collector&rsquo;s deck!<br/><br/>Collect elemental shards and karma crystals from the swarm, but be careful. You are limited on attacks against them. Use the swarm for your benefit, but don&rsquo;t be caught by it as other players use it against you!<br/><br/>As you build your collection of elemental shards and karma crystals, you can trigger the end of the game, but be careful not to do this before you are sure of the win.<br/><br/>In addition to the unique dice matching game mechanic, a unique auto player system is also used to facilitate up to EIGHT total players per game. The game also provides an easy way to track multiple game wins for playoffs in case you have more than 15 to 45 minutes to play depending on the number of players. No paper score cards and pencil needed. Your game score is determined by the number of elemental shards and karma crystals you score.<br/><br/>",

        "description": "The game can be played in two different modes. The &quot;Training Operation&quot; mode is a free-for-all where players try to prove they are the most qualified hacker for the secret agent position. The &quot;Special Operation&quot; mode is a team mode (all vs. one) where one player takes on the role of a rogue agent trying to protect secret information. The other players try to recover all of the critical data before security shuts the whole system down.<br/><br/>In both modes gameplay proceeds in turns. During a player's turn he will move his pawn from one tile to another (which represents accessing different computer systems) across connection points, revealing facedown tiles in the process. Each revealed tile will indicate how many data tokens are to be placed on the tile facedown. A player on that tile can choose to take the data tokens which each indicate a value on their face which is kept hidden from the other players. Collected data tokens can be saved by a player by returning to his start tile. A player can also leave firewall and virus tokens on a tile which will slow other players down. In addition to finding data on revealed tiles, players can also find antivirus tokens and firewall access tokens which will allow them to move to a tile containing a virus or firewall. If two players' pawns are on the same tile one of them may initiate a hack attack, which involves rolling dice. The victor may steal a data token from the loser.<br/><br/>The game continues for 11-15 rounds after which the player who has saved the most data is the winner (in &quot;Training Operation&quot; mode).<br/><br/>In &quot;Special Operation&quot; mode the rogue agent must prevent the other agents from retrieving all of the data tokens before time runs out.<br/><br/>",

Players play starter cards to earn Coins and buy better cards from the Game stacks. They can also use Coins to Score on the Games. Each player attempts to fill up a High Score table to take control of that game before an opponent can do the same. Once a player takes control of a stack, other players can't touch it.

Only one man can protect the innocent children from bullies, cheaters, and thiefs. But unfortunately Principal Jones is usually too tied up with PTA meetings, in-service days, and keeping his office chair warm. That leaves Adin Simon, private eye, gumshoe, and sleuth to clean up after the fact. Fourth grade may not be safe, but with a bit of grit and determination he'll solve your case and bring your culprit to justice...or get wedgied trying.<br/><br/>Fourth Grade Confidential is a microgame of deduction, bluffing, and cunning, based on Neal Simon's comic book project called Fourth Grade Confidential. The premise is that a fourth grader named Adin is a private eye at his school, working to solve the great mysteries of elementary school, like who stole his sister's stuffed pink bunny.<br/><br/>In Fourth Grade Confidential one player is the Sleuth while 2-4 other players are the Characters. Each round the Sleuth is trying to solve a different mystery. The Sleuth has six Sleuth Cards and the other 12 cards are dealt evenly to the Characters. The Sleuth has six turns to try to figure out which Character has the Target Item for that round by calling out various attributes and seeing who has items with matching attributes. Through careful deduction and use of actions the Sleuth and Characters all try to be the player to end up with the Target Item.<br/><br/>The Sleuth: Each round a new player will take on the roll of the Sleuth. The Sleuth will be questioning the Characters and following up clues. If the Sleuth catches Characters lying about the items they have he'll get to perform additional actions to help him narrow down where the Target Item is.<br/><br/>The Characters: All other players are Characters in the current mystery. One Character will have the Target Item that the Sleuth is looking for. As the Sleuth questions Characters they will begin to reveal items they have to prove their innocence, or to throw the Sleuth off the track. Can you be cunning enough to keep the Target Item hidden from the Sleuth? Are you going to help the Sleuth figure out who is the Culprit? Maybe you're just out for yourself. Characters get to take actions if they reveal items the Sleuth is looking for, without giving up the Target Item. But if they are caught lying the Sleuth gets extra actions to help him find the Culprit.<br/><br/>The round ends when the Sleuth runs out of Actions or when he finds the Target Item. Scoring can be totaled for each round and then scores totaled after everyone has had a chance to be the Sleuth an equal number of times.<br/><br/>",

        "description": "In Hero Flix, you take on the role of a movie director. Your task is to complete a production and earn Production Points toward a winning score of 10 points. More complex productions have a higher Production Point value but also take longer to complete.<br/><br/>While working towards Completing a Production, there are opportunities to increase the value of your production or impact the production of other players. Some examples include:<br/><br/><br/>    Joining in their success (joining them as a Co-Producer),<br/>    Lowering the Production Point value (through a Smear Campaign), or<br/>    Preventing them from Completing the Production this turn (via an Injunction).<br/><br/><br/>Hero Flix enables you to change the level of interaction by removing some cards from the game. We break these styles into three &ldquo;Budget Levels&rdquo;:<br/><br/><br/>     &quot;B Movie&quot; - there is a low chance of influencing another player,<br/>     &quot;Major Motion Picture&quot; - you have some chance for influencing another player, and<br/>     &quot;Summer Blockbuster&quot; - another player production will get influenced unless you are doing it wrong. This is how the game was designed to be played.<br/><br/><br/>",

While stand-alone rules exist, Henceforth is best played in a campaign format which can take place up to (and sometimes over) 15 game sessions or &ldquo;stays.&rdquo; Over the course of these stays players will earn experience to exchange for new skills and discover useful gear and weapons to aid them as they begin to unravel the game&rsquo;s overarching mystery.<br/><br/>Each stay sees your characters holing up in a somewhat safe location lovingly dubbed the &ldquo;home base.&rdquo; Here your characters will spend action points to attack the Blues, build defenses, search for supplies, and more.<br/><br/>A stay ends when there are either no characters left to take actions, either because they have all evacuated or (worse) been killed, or a story trigger occurs. Story triggers are special events tied to the game&rsquo;s campaign adventure book. This book consists of a series of scenarios which will help guide your characters to their next point in the campaign, eventually leading the group to one of Henceforth: The Living and the Dead&rsquo;s many story endings.<br/><br/>The game is driven by an element of push-your-luck that greatly rewards players that take risks but can seriously endanger the entire group if those same risk-takers get too greedy (or desperate).  It is very easy to draw attention to your home base in Henceforth; one wrong move, and a herd of insane, blue-skinned monsters will quickly surround your characters making it impossible to escape unscathed.<br/><br/>Warning: Henceforth is excruciatingly unforgiving.<br/><br/>For starters, each character only has six hit points. With each point of damage your character takes, the chances of that character suffering a long-term injury increases. Next, food and ammunition are both extremely limited and only become harder to find the longer you all stay in one place. So you gotta keep moving. Finally, you must keep track of your character&rsquo;s sanity in the game as suffering too much or seeing too many horrible things can drive them mad, making them easy targets for the blues.<br/><br/>",

It is a well-balanced mix of area-control, resource-management and strategy that has enough to interest lots of different types of gamers. You can find yourself in a furious battle to control Niigata or engaged in making desperate alliances to save-guard your borders... only for your allies to turn around and betray you several turns later!<br/><br/>You (Yes, YOU!) are a noble Daimyo of Japan. Your role is to expand and conquer provinces, then set them to produce resources and score Victory Points. However, do you do what the Emperor wishes you to do or follow your own path? (That is what the concept of SEISHIN is all about!) Every year, the Emperor's wishes change and different resources are plentiful or scarce, so the game is constantly changing!<br/><br/>Roll dice, play Action Cards, attack and defend, produce and score. Expand your influence and take over regions. However, Japan is only so large and can take only so much political upheaval before all heck breaks loose and Civil WAR! is declared! Now the Emperor's own provinces come under attack and everyone's loyalty wavers in the red tide of War!<br/><br/>Who will be left in first place when all the final points have been totaled and the last Victory Points added? Who will be crowned the new Emperor or Empress? Only time will tell. So put on your armour, draw your katana and take battle to Japan, as the fires of War and beckoning and you will never take Osakaaaaaa!!!<br/><br/>",

Names, characters, businesses, places, events, locales, and incidents are either the products of the designer&rsquo;s imagination or used in a fictitious manner. Any resemblance to actual persons, living or dead, or actual events is purely coincidental.<br/><br/>Setup:<br/>Shuffle the Political Issues and Candidate Cards into their respective piles. Give each player a starting hand of three Candidate cards. First player goes to whoever recently tried to weasel their way out of a violation and got away with it.<br/><br/>Basic Game: 3 &ndash; 5 Players<br/>Plataporma is played in a series of rounds where players try to get the vote of the Voter player to earn points. The first to 3 points wins!<br/><br/>Step 1 : Reveal the Issue<br/>The Voter chooses a card in their hand that will be the Current Issue for the round. They then read it aloud and put it on the table for everyone to see.<br/><br/>Step 2 : Promote Candidates<br/>Each other player (starting from the player to the Voter&rsquo;s left) chooses 2 cards from their hand to play as their candidates (President and Vice-President pairing). They must explain to the Voter why their candidates are the best to address the Current Issue. Once per round, if a player doesn&rsquo;t like the candidates in their cards, they may discard as many cards from their hand to draw that many new cards.<br/><br/>Step 3 : Vote for favorite Candidate<br/>After each player has taken their turn to promote their candidates, the Voter chooses which pair they liked the most. The player whose pair was picked wins the round and gets a point! They put the Current Issue card face down in front of them to track their points.<br/><br/>Step 4 : Prepare for the next round<br/>Everyone discards all used cards and then draws back up to 4 cards. If there are no more cards in the draw deck, shuffle the discarded cards back into the draw deck.<br/><br/>Step 5 : Start the next round<br/>Start a new round with the player that won the last round as the new Voter for the round. The first player to get 3 points wins!<br/><br/>Debate Variant: 6 &ndash; 10 Players<br/><br/>The round begins with the Leader also known as the Chairman, drawing a Political Issue and reads out loud.<br/><br/>The players to the Chairman&rsquo;s right and left are now debate opponents and selects their respective electoral match up. The rest of the players are called voters. The opponents have 2 minutes to explain why their pair is better than the other in addressing the political issue.<br/>The chairman counts to 3; voters simultaneously raises their right or left hand to indicate their preferred pair in reference to the chairman&rsquo;s right or left. The Opponent with the most votes wins a point. Chairman breaks ties.<br/><br/>Players shuffle back played candidate cards and draws up to their beginning hand. Player to the chairman&rsquo;s left is the new leader for the next round. Play continues until a player reaches 3 points, that player is the winner.<br/>Party Variant: 10+ Players<br/><br/>It plays the same as the basic game except for a few things: The voter draws 3 political issue cards and chooses to play 2. Players must address both issues.` The rest of the players only chose one candidate card and must declare to the other players their selection. Next they must convince someone else to be their running mate. If they are unable to get a partner, they are forced to use just one candidate. Players must do this selection as quick as possible.<br/>Play goes as normal, except they now have 2 minutes per team, and both are making their presentation in tandem. Speaking and acting in character is highly recommended.<br/>The voter chooses the winning pair, both players get a point each by giving them their Political Issue card. If a player was forced to use one candidate, they only get 1 point, represented by the Political Issue Card.<br/><br/>This work is licensed under the Creative Commons Attribution-NonCommercial-ShareAlike 4.0 International License.

        "description": "Colonial Space Wars: Invasion (CSW) is a sci-fi tactical wargame with 18mm scale miniatures that recreates battles between armies called Combat Swords. Each one is formed by a group of soldiers, drones or other creatures, represented in the game by metal or resin miniatures. These models move across a tabletop with scenery elements that emulate open battlefields, military complexes, the interior of buildings or spacecrafts.<br/><br/>CSW battles are resolved by Turns, in which each player acts alternatively. At the beginning of his Turn, one player will add to his pool the COMMAND points given by his LEADER or NODE units. COMMAND points available can be used then to activate units, and each unit requires a number of COMMAND points to be used.<br/><br/>A typical game is a Sudden Death match, where the winner is the player that eliminates their opponent&rsquo;s ability to activate units. However, in addition to this a description of advanced rules and missions for more experienced players is given.<br/><br/>",

Do you desire an easy escape or maybe you seek a death-defying challenge.<br/><br/>Thunder Bridge is a fast paced game that keeps you on the edge of your seat with three styles of play. Game setup and play can be seconds or a few minutes. Everyone wants a turn setting up the bridge and declaring which style will be played with their design.<br/><br/>I dare you to play it only once... heck, I dare you to play it only half a dozen times!<br/><br/>After fleeing old Hallux in 1906 a wall of trees sprung up to separate it from the new town of Hallux Rigidus 8 miles south. During the spring of 1910 there was an earthquake that swallowed the wall of trees leaving a huge chasm between the towns instead. A few months later a bridge was discovered spanning the chasm. No one knows who put it there. It was soon titled Thunder Bridge for the obnoxiously loud thunderous noises it makes when you traverse it.<br/><br/>",

        "description": "8 Seconds is a press-your-luck dice and card game with some strategic decisions for 1-6 players.  There are also three optional expansion modules that can be played with the main game individually or together.  8 Seconds is about the action and excitement of bull riding in a rodeo.  Roll your dice and match your moves to the moves of the Bulls.  But beware the rodeo clowns!  There are only two on staff, so if you roll a third Rodeo Clown you&rsquo;ll have to fill in and you won&rsquo;t score your Bull!<br/>Features:<br/> &bull; Fast Paced<br/>&bull; Press-Your-Luck with Strategy<br/>&bull; Player Interaction<br/>&bull; Unique Theme<br/>&bull; No Downtime (w/ Vegas Showdown option)<br/> Overview:  In 8 Seconds the eight dice have one of five different values on each face: Turn, Buck, Kick, Blank, or Rodeo Clown.  Rodeo Clowns are kept, Blanks are rerolled, and everything else can either be kept or rerolled.  At the start of your turn you&rsquo;ll draw three Bull cards and then roll the dice.  You must match your dice rolls to the moves indicated on the cards (turns, kicks, and bucks) in order to successfully ride the Bull.  You can reroll dice as needed, but the cost is discard one of your Bull cards, until you are left with just one Bull to ride.  If you successfully ride a Bull you&rsquo;ll collect that Bull and earn the points indicated.  Foul Tokens can be earned during the game that allow you to reroll clowns, reroll without discarding a bull, add another bull to their lineup, or score bonus points.<br/><br/>8 Seconds goes until one player has successfully ridden three Bulls, and then everyone else gets a final turn.  The winner is the player with the most points in Bulls and Foul Tokens.<br/><br/>Vegas Showdown:  Vegas Showdown is an optional play mode for 8 Seconds that eliminates a common issue with many multiplayer press-your-luck games &ndash; what to do when it&rsquo;s not your turn.  8 Seconds &ndash; Vegas Showdown brings the excitement of betting to the game when it is not your turn to ride the bulls, keeping players engaged throughout the entire game.<br/><br/>Solitaire: 8 Seconds also has a solitaire variant that allows the game to be played solo.  This is a quick diversion that can be played within the space of a lap desk or airline tray.<br/><br/>Additional Gameplay Modes:  The Golden Buckle adds Golden Buckle cards, which are available to everyone, until someone acquires each Golden Buckle.  Golden Buckles are challenging to obtain, but give various rewards.  In The Riders, players get to take on the role of Bull Riders.  Each Rider has a special ability that can be used whenever appropriate throughout the game.<br/><br/>",

        "description": "Outer Gods and Interlopers is a social deduction game where Cultists are performing rituals to the great and powerful Outer Gods.  A few investigators have attempted to infiltrate and subvert the rituals from within but the Cult Leader has becoming increasingly weary of this and has taken to sacrificing those within the cult.<br/><br/>Your objective as a cultists is to successfully get Rituals to pass and as the investigator team to sow enough discord that the cult will fail in their task of bringing upon certain doom to the world.<br/><br/>During the ritual phase the cult leader will reveal the top ritual from the deck, it will have one or more components required for successful completion.  It will also have one disruptive component that if added to the ritual will bring discord to the cult.  All other players will commit a component, from their hand of three cards, face down to the ritual.<br/><br/>All players will have a hidden background that may force them to play a certain way, ie. if you are the Madman you must play any offering components you have.<br/><br/>The cult leader will then shuffle and reveal the committed components and if the necessary requirements have been met the ritual will succeed and favor from the outer gods will be gained.  If the ritual does not succeed the investigators will add more discord and get one step closer to winning the game.<br/><br/>The game features a unique moderator role that makes decisions with the game, as well as unique player abilities that provide many opportunities to either sniff out the Investigators or sow discord.<br/><br/>",

        "description": "Peace was once kept between the races by the Order of the Paladins in the service to the King. That was until the chief paladin gave-in to corruption. After summoning Undead armies he destroyed the kingdom. Since the fall of the central government the races of the land have scattered and formed themselves into various factions. The factions trust none but their own and seek to prevent another from ruling over them.<br/><br/>In &quot;Races of War&quot; each player controls a faction and tries to defeat their opponent's faction, thus ensuring their survival for another day. Each faction has a unique array of creatures with varying abilities, spells and attacks.<br/><br/>The players take turns advancing creatures across the board. The pieces all look the same from the back, but have identifying numbers on the front. The identity of the pieces is only revealed when they are involved in an attack or use other abilities or spells. Be the first to locate and capture your opponent's commander and the rest will surrender.<br/><br/>",

        "description": "It&rsquo;s the last hour of the school day, on a Friday, before a vacation, and there&rsquo;s a substitute teacher in study hall. Of course a spitball fight breaks out &hellip; Players will buy classroom combat troops, set them up on the study hall battle grid, and wage furious pencil driven warfare!<br/><br/>Players take turns spending 12 troop points, buying and placing a single troop each turn. Troops are represented by unique symbols, cost the number of squares they cover, and each have an action as detailed in the troop chart. Troops can never move once they are placed.<br/><br/>Once all 12 points of troops have been placed, players will take turns using the actions of all of their available troops. Some troops are only available on some rounds, and destroyed troops can never take an action. The start player is whoever was most recently in detention. Rounds are tracked on the round chart with each player drawing half of an X in the current round box after they have acted, making a full X after both sides have gone.<br/><br/>To use an action, place your pencil tip on the acting troop, close your eyes, and draw a line - an action line &ndash; toward another troop. An action is successful if the action line touches another troop, affecting the first troop it touches (unless the troop&rsquo;s description says differently). An action line doesn&rsquo;t have to be ruler straight, but it must travel in what is generally a straight line. You can&rsquo;t scribble or go all ziggy-zaggy.<br/><br/>When a troop is damaged, shade in one of its squares. It doesn&rsquo;t matter which square gets shaded. Repairs work the same way, but you erase the damage from the affected troop. When a troop has all it&rsquo;s squares shaded in, it is destroyed. If a troop has been destroyed it can still be repaired.<br/><br/>The first player to destroy all their opponent&rsquo;s troops wins! If no one has won by the 24th round, whoever has taken the least damage wins.<br/><br/>",

But not all are worthy of such honor, and only those artisans able to create the best weapons, armor and shields have a chance.  <br/>Hephaestus is a simple, yet very involving game that brings all the strategy from the worker placement mechanics using only cards. Each blacksmith has a special skill and a single specialty. On her turn, the player must choose one of the actions of the game and pick up the card of that action:<br/><br/><br/>     Buy resources  <br/>     Purchase contracts  <br/>     Buy improvements for weapons  <br/>     And Install Improvements  <br/><br/><br/>Each contract describes how to create an equipment, which can be either a weapon, an armor or a shield, and shows the resources and the amount of work needed to create the equipment. For each piece of equipment you will need to heat the metal, cool it down and then smash it with your hammer! The required time for each step depends on the equipment, and the time you will actually take to forge it depends on the action cards you will take during the game. Each time you complete a contract, you receive the number of victory points described in it, earning bonus points according to their powers and their improvements! The game ends when the contract card deck is over, and the blacksmith who has the most victory points is the winner!<br/><br/>Game Components:<br/>- 104 Cards  <br/>- 4 players boards  <br/>- 26 Resource tokens<br/><br/>",

You can replace these with counters and real lollipop sticks when budget allows! If you have a collection of models and some terrain already you can dive right in with those.<br/><br/>I don&rsquo;t have any pirate models&hellip; is that a problem?<br/>Not at all. There are 'print and play' models included. Buccaneer&rsquo;s Bounty has rules for using other common model types.<br/><br/>How long does a game take?<br/>About 20 minutes, even with 4 players. I wanted the game to play quickly with each player taking short turns, so no one is left waiting for long to act. The scenarios are quick to set up, so if you want to play another game it&rsquo;ll only take a minute to get going again.<br/><br/>",

        "description": "From the designer:<br/><br/>Dungeon Dealer generates random maps with enemies, traps, and obstacles. Draw a card, roll a 20 sided die to see which position the new map section goes, and see if you've been surprised by the enemy. For both free drawing and 3D tiles, every card is different. There are literally billions of ways to lay out a map using these unique cards. Both decks can be combined to create massive dungeons.<br/><br/>For solitary, cooperative, and competitive play, Dungeon Dealer is a flexible game with a number of rules:<br/><br/>Solitary gameplay<br/><br/>a.    Initially pulling a starting map card from the deck <br/>b.    hand drawing or placing three dimensional tiles in the shape of the map shown on the card<br/>c.    placing character within that drawn grid map<br/>d.    progressing from 1 inch square to 1 inch square within the perimeters of the tabletop roleplaying experience<br/>e.    drawing a new card once the player is on an unexplored/open edge of the map<br/>f.    rolling a 20 sided die to determine the north, east, south, or west orientation of that card <br/>g.    hand drawing or placing three dimensional tiles in the shape of the map shown on the new card<br/>h.    discarding that used card<br/>i.    reacting to the random placement of each asset on the card like enemies, obstacles, and traps<br/>j.    repeating these turns in a cycle as the map grows<br/>k.    ending game when all cards are drawn or all players perish.<br/><br/>Cooperative gameplay<br/><br/>a.

One of the best things about tabletop roleplaying is how DIY the culture is. It&rsquo;s a community built on making and sharing. By keeping this deck simple, we&rsquo;ve allowed it to be adaptable in countless preexisting systems.<br/><br/>",

You impress him by performing various actions efficiently, building your wealth, and showing you are a knowledgeable and have great diversity.<br/><br/>You get to choose among 55 Occupations to play (Baker, Miner, Locksmith, Shipwright, etc.). Some Occupations obtain raw resources (cotton, gold ore, oak, etc.), while others convert resources (gold ore-&gt;pure gold, oak-&gt;spear, gold necklace-&gt;gold diamond necklace, etc.). Some even just perform services for prestige points (bard singing, physician curing the sick, etc.).<br/><br/>The game takes place over a year period, with 1 Occupation being used per month. Therefore, you have 12 months (turns) to impress The King and prove he should appoint you as his royal steward.<br/><br/>",

The capture of the crossroads at Lausdell in the first days of the attack was crucial, as this would allow the 1st SS Panzer division to breakthrough. Holding the critical road juncture were the 1st Battalion, 9th Regiment of the 2nd Infantry Division, with support from Company A, 741st Tank Battalion and elements of the 99th Infantry Division, who had fallen back in the face of the overwhelming opening attacks the day before at Lanzerath. Behind this small force there was literally nothing to stop the Germans. Tasked with seizing the Lausdell crossroad was the 12th SS, Hitler Youth Division. One of the war&rsquo;s truly epic fights was about to begin.<br/><br/>",

One of the cards (the start card) is dealt face up and the others? Shuffle them and then place them in a 3x3 formation.<br/><br/>Each turn you one step on the Forest cards. Each time you step on a new Forest card you turn it upright to see what you have to do while you are there. Some cards tell you to shuffle specific board cards, one lets you take a Light token and there is one you never want to find; Slimmer Man&rsquo;s Card that makes you get a Fear token.<br/><br/>How to win? Walk around the board 10 times without finding Slimmer Man, but if he gets you, you receive a Fear token and you and your partner steps by the Forest are back to zero, but if you have Light token and Slimmer Man appear light him instead of receiving a Fear token. With 4 times that you give Light Slimmer Man or 10 steps through the Forest are enough to win.<br/><br/>",

        "description": "Survive The Horde Party Game is a 2-8 player character-driven game with zombie battles and in-game challenges intended for a 17+ audience.<br/><br/>The game starts by selecting a character card and a set number of brain chips. Players take turns in a clockwise order. To take a turn, a player takes the top card from the zombie deck and reads it out loud. Zombie cards may have an in-game challenge, a Curse, or you may have to attack the zombie with a roll of the dice. When a zombie is defeated, players are rewarded with a survivor card. These survivor cards feature wacky ways to slay zombies, help you survive, and sabotage other players. When a player fails to defeat a zombie or complete a challenge, they must turn one of their brain chips to its undead side. If all brains have been turned to their undead side, a player is now undead and must try to win battles and challenges to get themselves back in the game.<br/><br/>A player wins by being the last player with at least one healthy brain chip.<br/><br/>",

We've got some new worlds to explore!<br/><br/>Play solo, with others (up to 4 players) in coop style or against each other. Goal? Collect and earn the most Golden Coins when the last Merchant Ship arrives at his destination! This could take between 60 to 180 minutes. Depends a lot on how you play it! Playing pirate style? Possible! More into trading? Possible too! Or perhaps you&rsquo;re a sneaky bastard and let your opponent drift of the corner of the Earth. Haven&rsquo;t you heard it? The Earth is flat and you could fall off..<br/><br/>Every player starts with his/her own player card and a big empty table ready to explore new Islands to buy and sell goods (Silk, Coffee, etc). With the profits you buy upgrades to sail faster, turn sharper, become more devastating with better canons, upgrade the amount of goods you could hold and much more! Conquer the game controlled Merchants ships (up to 4) en bring them back to a safe haven. Collect their goods and earn even more Golden Coins!<br/><br/>Every player needs to sail upwind or at max with crosswind and depending on their speed marker placing their little ship marker 1 or more tiles further away. They pick randomly new tiles and place them adjacent around their ship. You will find probably more sea tiles (160+!) or maybe a new Island (up to 5)? Who knows! A fact is: no game is the same!<br/><br/>Don&rsquo;t like the wind direction? Well, pay for it (in a auction) and change it! It comes with a flaw though: you&rsquo;re sitting duck the next part of this round&hellip;<br/><br/>Remember: The player with the most Golden Coins wins in the end! Be wise to spend not all of your Golden Coins with upgrades/goods. You&rsquo;re not the first to win with just a few Golden Coins ;-)<br/><br/>Description from the designer (Dutch):<br/><br/>Welkom aan boord Kapitein. Je gaat nieuwe werelden ontdekken, handel drijven en de piraat uithangen!<br/><br/>Neem als speler een eigen overzichtsbord en plaats de markers op de getallen binnen de blauwe balken. Zoals je ziet heeft jouw schip de mogelijkheid om Suiker, Specerijen, Koffie, Zijde en Slaven te vervoeren.<br/><br/>Maar hoe goed kan jij de wind bevaren? Tegen de wind in kom je geen steek verder! En alleen met zijwind of meewind kom je vooruit.  Want dat moet je, je moet winst maken om jouw schip te verbeteren om uiteindelijk zo veel mogelijk goudstukken over te houden aan het einde van het spel als alle koopvaardijschepen binnen zijn.<br/><br/>Kies een plek op de tafel waar vandaan jouw schip zal vertrekken (de jongste speler begint en daarna met de klok mee). Deze thuishaven beschermt je tegen anderen en daar kun je goudstukken veilig opslaan. Echter kun je in jouw thuishaven niets kopen, verkopen of upgraden. Geef de windrichting een slinger en kies de windrichting naar het Noorden, Zuiden, Oosten of Westen die het meest in de buurt komt<br/><br/>Door jouw onervarenheid als Kapitein mag je jouw schip in het begin maar steeds 1 veld verder zetten. Met upgrades zal je sneller en wendbaarder worden. Iedere keer nadat je jouw schip hebt verplaatst leg je direct daar omheen nieuwe zeetegels en ontdek je misschien wel nieuwe eilanden met een haven. Aangekomen bij een haven worden op de eilandenkaart bijgehouden welke goederen gekocht en verkocht kunnen worden en voor welke prijs. Met goudstukken koop je upgrades in de havens die je aandoet. Besteed dus niet meteen al je goudstukken aan vracht!<br/><br/>Maar je bent niet alleen op zee&hellip; Er varen ook andere piraten rond en misschien zelfs schijterige koopvaardijvaarders met interessante waren&hellip;<br/><br/>Een spel om alleen of met anderen om samen (of tegen elkaar) te strijden!<br/><br/>",

Each Lord has brought Seven Knights, all of whom have, for whatever reason, decided to make some poor decisions the night before the battle. All of these knights have found themselves in one of three places: The Tavern, The Inn, and the Armory. The Lords, having heard of the shenanigans going on throughout the castle, have dispatched messengers to each of their seven knights, instructing them to finish up whatever they are doing, and return to the barracks at once. To make things interesting, the Lords have offered handsome rewards to the knights who return best prepared for the ensuing battle.<br/><br/>The race is on for the Knights to return to their Lord's Barracks, ready for battle.<br/><br/>Game Play:<br/><br/>Novice Knights is a Victory Point game, kind of like Settlers Of Catan. The goal is to gain 17 Victory Points in the 4 player variant, and 19 Victory Points in the 2 player variant.<br/>The game play itself consists of three areas: The Inn, The Tavern, and The Armory, each with its own unique game mechanics and ways to earn Victory Points.<br/><br/>The Tarvern is a simple &quot;Roll the Dice and Advance&quot; board game, kind of like Chutes and Ladders. There are separate symmetrical paths for each player to follow, with danger along the way. For each Knight that successfully navigates his way out of The Tavern, the player earns Victory Points.<br/><br/>The Inn is a basic tile choosing/flipping game, like a simpler version of Carcassonne. Players select tiles without knowing what is in store for them on the other side. Both danger and glory await behind The Inn's tiles.<br/><br/>The final section, The Armory, holds the most dangerous and challenging section of the game. This Card-Based section, reminiscent of Munchkin offers the Knights the opportunity to suit up before the battle. The only problem is, several Dragons have made their home in The Armory, and it's dangerous to go alone (Take this!).<br/><br/>",

        "description": "This abstract game is the best brain exercise for the whole family. To win, you must score as many points as possible while blocking your opponents' winning moves.<br/><br/>The goal is to score points by aligning the color of your tokens in rows, columns, diagonals and squares of four positions. The game combined the concepts of Go, Reversi, Gomoku, Chess, Mahjong and tic-tac-toe. Players must observe not only the tokens on the game board (Qu-Mat), but also each player's tokens in possession. The game ends when a player exceeds the target score preset by the players prior to the game. Using a special scoring procedure, this game allows players to play with money instead of points.<br/><br/>Requires the Qu-MAT (sold separately) to play.<br/><br/>",

Hold the paper up between each other for 5 seconds. The side you are looking at shows your goal items. You then flip the paper over so each player is looking at the other player's side. (maybe draw a little stick figure example?)<br/>    <br/>2. Each player takes turns trying to rip out a single item at a time from the items on their goal side WITHOUT looking at it while the other player holds the page up.<br/>    <br/>3. Each item successful ripped off in full, with no pieces of any other item on the same piece is worth one point. Most points when all the items are taken or damaged wins.<br/>    <br/>4. Check PrettiestPrincessGames.com for a rules video and more details and variants.<br/><br/>You'll find that in the process of trying to get the most stuff, you'll not only end up destroying what you want by accident, but also knowingly trashing the stuff your ex wants.<br/><br/>Part of the Prettiest Princess Games Consumable 1-Sheet line.<br/><br/>",

        "description": "Apokalypse was a miniature wargame set in a dystopian future, the aftermath of the final war. It simulated the desperate skirmishes, firefights and encounters taking place in the last 120 days of humanity. The players took the role of powermongers, leaders and warlords of what armed forces still existing in the postapocalyptic wasteland, using remaining survivors as tools to enforce their agenda.<br/><br/>It was stated Apokalypse used 25mm miniatures but since that scale later came to be known as (non-heroic) 28mm you could generally say that 28mm is the default standard for the game. The length measure unit, &quot;meters&quot;, was intentionally meant for being adapted to whatever scale of minis you had access to, making the game playable with all scales of miniatures.<br/><br/>When Hardcore Media was liquidated, around 1998-99, the game faded into obscurity and very much stayed that way.<br/>In 2016 it was made available online, as a freeware document with the creators' consent, through a fan-made PDF of the original rulebook (available in the Web Links section).<br/><br/>There were occasional references to expansions throughout the core rulebook. The material for all of these was sadly destroyed when Hardcore Media folded and its creators moved on to different projects. Despite this, Apokalypse was a fully finished product and contains all the rules and information needed to play.<br/><br/>",

        "description": "A storytelling card game. Includes 55 unique cards (no duplicates) of photographed wildlife, mostly of raccoons. The game is &quot;creative and non-competitive&quot;. Game play variations abound. For example players alternate drawing a card from the face down draw pile and place face up, and then describe the scene in a single sentence as it relates to previously drawn cards. A sequence of cards, left to right thereby tells a story. A variation has each player offer a scene description and then all players vote on the best one. Another alternative has players maintain a hand of cards and on their turn offer a card to extend the story, or all players offer one card and then vote on the best story extension with that one card added to the card sequence. Although not intended as a competitive game, it could be played where the winner is the first that runs out of cards (discarding your last card requires coming up with an ending better than any other players' story extensions), or collects the most rejected cards. A variation of &quot;Go Fish&quot; can be played where one player turns over a card, and then all players attempt to turn over the best matching card. The player with the best match as determined by vote takes the two matching cards, all other cards are turned back over, and that player turns over the next card to be matched.<br/><br/>",

If there are less than four players, some of them have to take more than one team.<br/><br/>The rules say that the game is for 1 to 5 players. Of course, in the case of playing solo, the player takes all four teams. This lets clear that, although this not just a roll-and-move game and there are a fair number of decisions to be taken at each turn, there is not a complex strategy involved in the game.<br/><br/>The game does not include rules for different types of roads or riders. It represents a race on a flat circuit.<br/><br/>The winner of the game is the player who's riders arrive first at the finish.<br/><br/>",

The game generally follows a roll-and-move paradigm around a rectangular board (looking something like a doubled Monopoly board).  Various board locations may cause special circumstances, including &quot;teleporting&quot; to off-board locales where, generally, various types of player-vs-player activities are allowed.<br/><br/>The game primarily was designed by Jack Harness and other members of the Los Angeles Science Fantasy Association in the early 1970s; it had assumed a stable, final form by about 1972.  Games were said to last from hours to days.  It was routinely played (and continuously modified) by society members until about the advent of Original Dungeons &amp; Dragons.  Many game proponents created implementations of the game, all with hand-drawn art from Jack Harness, some with minor rules variations.<br/><br/>In 2016, Lee Gold and Barry Gold converted their personal extant copy into electronic format.  This involved a general revision for clarity and format of the not-inconsiderable rule book, as well as a production of a color electronic playing board.  This version was published for free download, intended for print-and-play use.  In addition to the revised and cleaned-up game, a scan of the original products also was made available.<br/><br/>The game is intriguing as a very early example of a basic type of role-playing game prior to the commercial advent of Dungeons &amp; Dragons.<br/><br/>",

Every Wrassler has varying Attack and Defend cards to try and either deal Hurt to an opponent, or avoid taking Hurt themselves.  After Attack and Defend cards are revealed, the Attacker rolls a single 6-sided Attack dice to determine if the Attack hit or missed.  <br/>Wrasslers can also pay MP to run, climb to the top rope, and brawl outside of the ring, as well as use traditional Wrasslin' weapons like Chairs and Tables to do even more Hurt.  Finishers, Taunts, Special cards, and unique Wrassler abilities also feature.<br/><br/>Reduce a Wrassler's Hurt Points low enough, and a player can try to Pin or Submit that Wrassler and win the match!<br/><br/>Tag team matches allow up to 4 players, and 5 different stipulation matches, like the 'Raise the Roof' Ladder match are also included.<br/><br/>",

        "description": "Historically important tabletop baseball simulation game,  recognized as the precursor to the highly successful APBA series. Players of the game select lineups of cards, each card representing an actual major league baseball player. The sequence of play consists of a series of plate appearances as if playing a game of baseball. Each plate appearance is resolved by: (1) rolling two dice, (2) reading a number code from the batter's card based on the roll, and (3) looking up the number code on a chart corresponding to the current distribution of runners on base to determine the result of the plate appearance.<br/><br/>The designer, Clifford Van Beek, was granted a U.S. patent for the game system in 1925 (#1536639), though the game was not published until 1930. The game was apparently only published once, with 18 cards for each of the 16 teams then competing in the major leagues.<br/><br/>A recreated version of the game was published in 2003 by a company called Sports Game Publishing.<br/><br/>",

Points can only be scored for pairs of numbers, and pairs must be formed on the same roll. If no pairs of numbers are rolled, the turn ends and the dice are passed to the next player.<br/><br/>Scoring can quickly get intense, as multiple pairs of the same number are worth bonus points, and getting 4 pairs plus a matching number on the &quot;extra&quot; dice allows players to re-roll all 9 dice again.<br/><br/>When a player earns a total score of 500 or more, all other players get one last turn to try and get enough points to surpass that score.  Once all players have received a final turn, the player with the highest score is the winner!<br/><br/>",

HOW TO PLAY<br/><br/>Each turn, the player puts a hex tile on the board. It's important to note the following: <br/> - at the beginning of the turn, you must hold 4 hex tiles in your hand <br/> - your hex tile can be put wherever you want on the game board <br/> - you can't pass on your turn <br/> - two adjacent hex tiles must be connected to one another (see section V. for more details)<br/><br/>IV. SPECIAL HEX TILES<br/><br/>Special hex tiles (block, chainsaw, bomb, rotation and switch) can be used at any moment of the game.

        "description": "An exciting game in which you must face the dangers of the jungle, to be the richest explorer. Explorers will go through the jungle in search of &quot;Eldorado&quot;. They will enter villages, cross rivers and confront beasts and tribes that will try to ensure that their expedition does not end well.<br/><br/>Each player starts the game with a character board, which indicates the initial abilities of this, as well as the life he has in each moment. He also receives a pawn of his color and a tent of his color.<br/>During the game, each player can find cards that help them improve their skills or increase their lives.<br/>The forest is represented by 73 tiles that are initially face down in the center of the table, we will turn them when we go exploring them, and a river that we must cross to go to the different zones of the forest.<br/>During the turn of each player can choose between three actions:<br/><br/>-Explore the jungle; He moves his pawn to an adjacent tile, and turns it face-up. Once you have seen the type of tile, you must steal a card from the corresponding deck and solve it with a dice roll, which depends on the skill you have.<br/><br/>-Recover territory explored; You can move your pawn by adjacent tiles from one to three, as long as they are scanned.<br/><br/>-Getting a camp; If your pawn has been placed in an abandoned camp tile, you can place your camp there by placing the tent of your color on this tile. You can change the location of your camp as many times as you want throughout the game. (This helps you when you contract a disease of the forest, since you must go to this camp to receive the treatment and to be able to continue playing)<br/><br/>The objective of the game is to be the explorer with more gold in his power when the game ends. The end of the game, occurs immediately when some explorer finds the mythical city of Eldorado, the player who finds it will receive a bonus of 10 gold coins.<br/>You will also receive a bonus of 4 gold coins, the most cursed explorer you have surpassed.<br/><br/>But beware, if a player is cursed when the game is over, he can not be a winner even if he is the one who has made the most money !!! So try to overcome the curses that you fell as soon as possible.<br/>                        <br/>                          *   *   *<br/><br/>Un trepidante juego en el que debes enfrentarte a los peligros de la selva, para ser el explorador m&aacute;s rico. Los exploradores recorrer&aacute;n la jungla en busca de &quot;Eldorado&quot;. Entraran en poblados, cruzaran r&iacute;os y se enfrentaran a bestias y tribus que intentar&aacute;n que su expedici&oacute;n no termine bien.<br/><br/>Cada jugador comienza la partida con un tablero de personaje,en el que indica las habilidades iniciales de este, as&iacute; como la vida que tiene en cada momento. Tambi&eacute;n recibe un pe&oacute;n de su color y una tienda de campa&ntilde;a de su color.<br/>Durante la partida, cada jugador puede encontrar cartas, que le ayuden a mejorar sus habilidades o a incrementar sus vidas.<br/>La selva est&aacute; representada por 73 losetas que inicialmente est&aacute;n bocabajo en el centro de la mesa, las iremos girando cuando las vayamos explorando, y un r&iacute;o que debemos cruzar para ir a las diferentes zonas de la selva.<br/>Durante el turno de cada jugador puede elegir entre tres acciones:<br/><br/>-Explorar la jungla; Desplaza su pe&oacute;n a una loseta adyacente, y la vuelve boca arriba. Una vez visto el tipo de loseta, debe robar una carta del mazo correspondiente y resolverla mediante una tirada de dados, que depende de la habilidad que posea.<br/><br/>-Recorrer territorio explorado; Puedes desplazar tu pe&oacute;n por losetas adyacentes de una a tres, siempre y cuando est&eacute;n exploradas.<br/><br/>-Colocar un campamento; si tu pe&oacute;n se haya situado en una loseta de campamento abandonado, puedes situar all&iacute; tu campamento situando sobre esta loseta la tienda de campa&ntilde;a de tu color. Puedes cambiar la ubicaci&oacute;n de tu campamento tantas veces como quieras durante toda la partida. (Esto te ayuda cuando contraes una enfermedad de la selva, ya que deber&aacute;s ir a este campamento a recibir el tratamiento y poder seguir jugando)<br/><br/>El objetivo del juego es ser el explorador con m&aacute;s oro en su poder cuando la partida termine. El final de la partida, se produce inmediatamente cuando alg&uacute;n explorador encuentra la m&iacute;tica ciudad del Eldorado, el jugador que la encuentre recibir&aacute; una bonificaci&oacute;n de 10 monedas de oro.<br/>Tambi&eacute;n recibir&aacute; una bonificaci&oacute;n de 4 monedas de oro, el explorador que m&aacute;s maldiciones haya superado.<br/><br/>&iexcl;&iexcl;&iexcl;Pero cuidado, si un jugador est&aacute; maldito cuando la partida acab&eacute;, no podr&aacute; ser ganador aunque sea el que m&aacute;s dinero haya conseguido!!! As&iacute; que intenta superar las maldiciones en que hayas ca&iacute;do lo antes posible.<br/><br/>",

The people who play this game cobble together the pieces from scrap metal and salvaged nuts and bolts. It&rsquo;s a harsh and unforgiving game that reflects the wasteland that gave it birth and the hard men and women that live the lessons it teaches.<br/><br/>Everyone moves at once each round. This is a six player game where it is always your turn!<br/><br/>The game board is dynamically built and destroyed every turn, every aspect of the game gives the player meaningful choices.<br/><br/>Player interaction uses a challenge system based on the classic prisoner&rsquo;s dilemma. The game can not be won through tactics or politics alone.<br/><br/>",

This is done by influencing the balance of the six elements in two distinct, but inextricably linked, theatres.<br/><br/>The first, representing the consciousnesses in conflict, enables players to infuse the elements with their raw power that can then be consumed, or nurtured, to determine the how the second proceeds.<br/><br/>That second environment is the domain of summoned, customised proxies - the elementals. Their power is governed by the first theatre and can be directly manipulated by players&rsquo; evocations. Conflict between elementals may encourage one side to end hostilities and rethink their strategy in a new round, but the battle of wills is not infinite and it is only the player who succeeds at the pre-defined end of the contest that is victorious.<br/><br/>",

The 4 corner spots of Qu-MAT are called CLOUDs. BIRDs or OSPREYs flying into a CLOUD spot will be immune from any attacks. There are 4 exterior corner areas called the NESTs.

Clearly published after the start of the war but before the entry of the United States, it is based on the idea of trading with America by using underwater freighters.<br/><br/>In game terms, it is a simple roll-and-move affair for up to six players. There are assorted spaces that cause delays or setbacks as well as a few that allow players to take money from the pot. The first player to complete a round trip from Bremen to the U.S. and back is told to shout &quot;Hurra!&quot; three times and take half the pot. The remainder is split by the rest of the players.<br/><br/>The game has art by Siegmund von Suchdolski, with a cover showing a winged Hermes head in a rising sun over a surfaced U-boat, and the board featuring images of a U-boat engine room and of U-boats in harbor, underway and being loaded with bales of goods.<br/><br/>",

You have been given new high-priority orders from General George C. Marshall to locate a missing paratrooper, Private First Class James Francis Ryan, and bring him home to safety.<br/><br/>Private Ryan&rsquo;s whereabouts are unknown. Rumors place him directly in the middle of enemy-occupied territory laden with snipers, minefields, deadly tanks, and heavily fortified villages.<br/><br/>You have been made Captain and placed in charge of this mission. With limited intel and an even smaller chance of success, you gather a team, ready your equipment, and set off to bring Private Ryan home.<br/><br/>'D-Day Express: Saving Private Ryan' is a solo wargame played using a single deck of double-sided cards. There are no counters and no record-keeping is needed to play. Cards are used to represent terrain, enemies, friendly units, damage, mines, debris, and hills, as well as used to generate random events, direct enemy fire, manage close combat engagements, and even determine whether snipers are successful in hitting their targets.<br/><br/>'D-Day Express: Saving Private Ryan' is a portable, compelling wargame experience that is easy to set up, quick to take down, perfect for travel and gaming in tight spaces, and most importantly, is fun to play! Just shuffle the cards and play!<br/><br/>",

Ordered to defend them were a few resolute soldiers who didn&rsquo;t have much equipment, but had a lot of free time on their hands. So they did as any soldier in the world does when there&rsquo;s nothing else to do: they dug in.<br/><br/>When the reconquest of the Pacific started, the United States Marine Corps had to deal with fortified positions right away. Some small islands had more bunkers and pillboxes than they had coconut trees! It was quickly pretty obvious that the Corps would need to adapt to get the job done.<br/><br/>The Marines were not prepared for this, as not everyone could carry a flame-thrower, therefore they needed something more practical. The Corps found its solution with the creation of the Demolition Squads. These men would be given basic instructions on how to handle explosives: throw a satchel full of them in roughly the right direction, and run the other way as fast as possible.<br/><br/>It was soon evident that if you were sent into one of these squads, you were soon to meet your maker - whatever you conceived Him to be. With such a high rate of casualties, they called themselves &lsquo;The Saints&rsquo;. Nevertheless, these Marines are immensely respected in the Corps, and often benefit from slightly more relaxed standards of discipline.<br/><br/>",

        "description": "Filling a gap in the Allied armoured arsenal between the M3A2 Mickey (Light) and the M3C Pounder, the M3G2 Barking Dog (Light) is an excellent anti-tank walker and can serve as a close support vehicle. Its six M40 recoilless guns fire in sequence, aimed at the same point thanks to a very advanced targeting system.<br/><br/>The sound of the guns firing a couple of seconds apart resembles a loud dog barking, hence the nickname of &lsquo;Barking Dog&rsquo;. This dog&rsquo;s bite is far worse than its bark! Its 106mm rounds will easily destroy enemy fortified positions or blast tanks into smouldering heaps of metal.<br/><br/>The downside is the reload time needed to make this magic happen. All six guns need to be loaded from the outside of the vehicle, one at a time. That&rsquo;s why you&rsquo;ll rarely see a Barking Dog alone on the battlefield. It behaves more like a wolf than a dog, either traveling in pack of its own, or with other walkers that complement its role.<br/><br/>The Marines&rsquo; Light Barking Dog is similar to the prototype tested by the Army, but has an open-topped turret for better vision and cross-country performance. It is probably the most popular walker in the Marine Corps&rsquo; arsenal.<br/><br/>",

        "description": "Teddy Hedz, or THZ for short, is a card game in which you attempt to hit your opponent repeatedly with a range of soft plush toy animal heads. The victor is rewarded with the right to hit their opponent with a real plush toy animal head, adding humiliation to failure.<br/><br/>Each round has a build phase, a battle phase and a draw phase. In the build phase players set up defenses, boost their abilities or initiate a battle. If a battle is declared, all players participate in the battle phase; pitting the skills of their THZ, as well as a variety of Buffs, Environments, Interrupts and Bearicades, in a duel. Winner scores virtual SCONs against their opponent. At the end of the battle, all players draw a card.<br/><br/>The first player to reach 10 SCONs &mdash; or the player with the most SCONs when the cards run out &mdash; wins and may claim the THZ to hurl at their opponent.<br/><br/>No actual teddy bears were harmed in the making of Teddy Hedz.<br/><br/>",

If this is you, then welcome to Forbidden!<br/> All players split into teams and in each round one player will try to get his team to guess the target word, without using any of the Forbidden words listed on the card.  If the player can get their teammates to guess the target word they score a point and move on to the next card, the object is to score as many points as possible in the time allowed.  However, if the player messes up and uses a Forbidden word or says any part of the target word then the card and the point go to the other team.  Additionally, if you are caught using any of the Forbidden words then you must draw a Forbidden card, these can be beneficial, but usually they are an additional obstacle that you must deal with on your next turn. <br/> We also have four types of special cards included in the deck-<br/> Skip- Allows you to skip past a difficult card without a penalty or without the other team getting a point.<br/> Steal- This card allows your team to jump in for a round and try to guess the target words while the other team gives clues.  Any words that you guess first will score a point for your team.<br/> F@*K You- Use this card to pass the most challenging cards to the other team, they must start their turn with that card.<br/> Wild- This card works as any one of the other cards, your choice!<br/> That&rsquo;s it, that&rsquo;s all you need to know to play the game, simple right?  However every game is unique based on who you play with and with a massive deck of Forbidden cards to play through you should expect countless hours of laughing at your friends.  <br/> Forbidden- A mature game, for immature people<br/><br/>",

The value of each investment is increased or decreased by rolling dice each turn, if the positive die (green) is higher than the negative die (red), the value moves up that many spaces.  If the red die is greater than the green die, the value drops and could even crash that stock completely!  Each turn there is a new 'Headline News' card that can affect the stock values in addition to the dice rolls.<br/><br/>After the dice are rolled and the values set, each player decides what they would like to buy and sell and tracks their shares on their own 'Portfolio' card.<br/><br/>After 10-turns, everyone sells their investments and the player with the most money wins the game!<br/><br/>",

Based on some of your favorite rockstars, you will find yourself in good company. After assembling their ideal four-piece, they take their act to the road.<br/><br/>Each turn, players traverse a map of America playing shows and building fame. As they travel coast to coast, by drawing event cards they will run into some snags along the way (such as bus breakdowns and cancelled shows), but if luck is on their side they will also encounter some great windfalls (like hit singles or magazine features).<br/><br/>On their turns, players choose from a variety of actions. They will regularly drive around from city to city in their very own tour bus. Performing shows, by a simple roll of the dice, is a steady form of income in the form of points. Performing market research is a great way for players to figure out which cities are dying to see their band. Players will even find themselves challenging their opponents to turn the tides.<br/><br/>As the game progresses, players will be drawn around the map to cities that are craving shows, some even hosting huge festivals. Complete these shows in exchange for big rewards, but beware, bigger wins also mean bigger losses. Failing shows no matter the size will increase the tension within your band, and if you don't keep it under control, it may just lead to your band's demise!<br/><br/>Eventually, each player will find that their growing band has reached a point where they need some help. They can hire a variety of skilled roadies including bus drivers, guitar techs, sound engineers and more.<br/><br/>To emerge victorious as a true Road Warrior, players must reach level 3 on the point track and complete at least 3 of the 4 game end goals. <br/>  &bull; Play each of the 4 industry cities<br/>  &bull; Play at least 10 successful shows in your home region<br/>  &bull; Hire 3 Roadies<br/>  &bull; Successfully challenge each other player at least once<br/><br/>",

        "description": "MALU is an abstract strategy board game for 2 or 4 players.<br/><br/>Long ago, high up in the Himalayan mountains, a group of traveler monks known as the Malu, wandered through its snowy peaks. Their days were filled with prayer, meditation, and training. As part of their training, they played a single board game. The game was elegant in its simplicity, yet complicated in its mastery. For generations the game was a closely guarded secret and used by the monks to train new acolytes in the art of traversing the narrow passages and treacherous peaks of the Himalayas.<br/><br/>One day, while the monks were attempting to cross a particularly narrow bit of mountain, a copy of the game was swept away in a snowstorm. It was brought down the mountain by an avalanche and eventually recovered by a small boy from a remote village. The boy was so intrigued by the game that he left his home to wander the mountains, track down the monks and learn the ways of the Malu.<br/><br/>Many years passed and the boy eventually grew to be an intelligent man, possessing all the secrets of the Malu. He eventually returned to civilization and brought with him the game of the Malu. By sheer chance (or perhaps fate), he has deemed you a worthy challenger. It is now time for you to test your skills... Do you have what it takes to out-think and out-maneuver your opponent and cross the mountain pass in MALU?<br/><br/><br/>The objective of the game is to move both your pawns across the map to the other side of the board and exit the map. The first player to have both their pawns exit the map wins.<br/><br/>The mechanics of the game are simple enough that anyone can pick up and start playing, but the depth of skill and many possible strategies to employ, allows for seasoned players to truly be masters of MALU.<br/><br/>Each turn, a player must move their pawn and place a neutral tile onto the board. As you place your tiles, adjoining tiles create paths that your pawns can move along. As your pawn moves, you have the ability to pick up those tiles and reroute them to your advantage... either as a path to the other side or as a means to block your opponents. But be careful... if you get too close, your opponent can snatch those tiles away from you and use them for themselves! You can also place walls of ice and mountain peaks as obstacles or knock down walls for strategic advantages.<br/><br/>Like many other classic games... first one to the finish wins! But in MALU, you will need to muster all your skill and cunning to make it past your opponent and be the first across the mountain pass.<br/><br/>",

        "description": "Description from the designer:<br/><br/>The pod station has suffered a catastrophic system failure. The crew is almost entirely missing, but those who survived the destruction made it to the main hub. There's only enough power left to launch one evacuation pod. You must begin to reconstruct the pod station. Move from pod to pod as the station takes on a new shape. Search through laboratories to find an evacuation key and other survival necessities. Access computers to find evacuation codes and detect problems within the station. Then, get to your evacuation pod to escape before it's too late!<br/><br/>In this modular board game, players must gain access to laboratories and computers in order to collect the cards necessary to evacuate. But, collecting isn't the only goal, as you must safely navigate your way to the correct Evacuation Pod to achieve the win. Fires, hull breaches, and power failures may need to be dealt with along the way.<br/><br/>The game can be played solo as a survival game or with friends as a cooperative or competitive game. There are also several alternate game &quot;scenarios&quot; that alter rules, remove cards, and add more challenging limitations to the game.<br/><br/>",

Italy, 1805-1815).<br/><br/>Napoleon and his Marshals covers 1805-1815 in France and Central Europe. Other expansions are underway that will add the Peninsular War, the Patriotic War in Russia and maps of Scandinavia and the rest of Italy. The game is strategic and operational. Each strategic turn is two months, broken down into 6 10-day operational turns.Forces are division level (5,000 men) per factor, with artillery, cavalry, Cossacks, and guerillas as additional specialized units. Leaders are included at the National Military Leader (Napoleon, Kutusov, etc.), Army commanders, and marshals/corps commanders. Combat units for 11 nations are included. In the expansions the naval war is added, with Nelson, other British Admirals, along with French, Spanish, and Russian admirals, and the navies of those countries and Denmark and Sweden, along with the armies of Spain and Portugal.<br/><br/>This is the basic game, required to play all other expansions and the campaign game, which will run from January 1805 through the end of 1815 or the final victory. Included is a 31&quot; x 23.5&quot; map, printed on plastic coated reinforced &quot;banner&quot; paper (which is rolled up for storage), and 5 counter sheets of 88 counters, printed front and back, and slightly larger than traditional counters at 0.6&quot; square. Map scale is about 28 miles to 38 miles per hex (depending on where you are on the map).<br/><br/>During the Strategic Turns, nations collect taxes (production) and expend it on organization and units, including leader activation, replacements, new units, mobilization, sea lift capacity, foreign aid, supplies, and other items. Diplomacy may also occur. During the ensuing 6 operational turns, leaders and units are moved, battles fought, sieges undertaken and possibly diplomacy is conducted.<br/><br/>There are six scenarios in the game: 1805 (vs Austria, Britain and Russia), 1806-07 (vs Prussia, Britain and Russia), 1805-1807 (vs all four), 1809 (vs Austria, Russia and Britain), 1813-1815 (vs all four), and 1815 (the 100 days of Napoleon's second reign). A player-turn takes about 5-15 minutes, so along with a strategic turn, a full &quot;season&quot; (two months is the length of a strategic turn and its associated operational turns) takes about 1.5 - 2.0 hours - less if there are no battles, more if there are many big battles.<br/><br/>",

In Le Voleur (the thief), you will gather a team of thieves trying to steal loots from various districts in downton Paris. Be mindful with your steps because not only you have to plan carefully and dodge the patrolling police, but rumor says there are other teams trying to expose you! Be careful with your planning and notes, because even a slightest mistake might ruin your perfectly planned heist!<br/><br/>Le Voleur is a logic-strategic game for 2 to 4 players. There are 2 main mechanics going on: the main board with area control and player board with deduction. On the main board, players need to create patterns by flipping colored tokens. With the right pattern, players can Scout and finally Steal the good. To flip the tokens, players need to use one of the Abilities of their agents, 4 are taken randomly from bag at setup, by turning their Agent's dial to show the desired abilities (shared color with the token on the board). Other players may mark these abilities on their player board, called Headquarter, which also shows the identity of all agents available in the game. Everytime an Agent use their abilities these clue grows and eventually reveal the Agent correct identity.<br/> The game played in 8 turns. Each turn are consist of several phases and each phase shows how many agents a player can play. If a player have less than 4 agents, he eventually lost all ability to use any actions on that phase and can only recruit new agents. Victory Points are collected by either Steal a Good or exposing other Agents. The first player with 5 Victory Points wins the game.<br/><br/>",

Meanwhile, the other player acts as The Powers That Be, secretly laying traps and deploying countermeasures while working to grow their influence over the city. Can the Crew get in and get out before The Powers complete their nefarious scheme?<br/><br/>One Last Job features hidden information, bluffing, and calculated risks as both players outwit and adapt to each other. In this seedy world of corruption and evil agendas, nothing is certain. An apparently easy heist can quickly go south due to unforeseen complications, while a near impossible one can be miraculously pulled off. Everything action and counteraction is a dangerous gamble for both sides.<br/><br/>Weather you want to play the classic heist of an elite professional team taking on the mafia to settle a score, or perhaps something more fantastical, One Last Job has you covered. Ever wonder how a group of 90s hackers would fare at preventing a world crisis by an evil mastermind? Or if you could get wacky street gangs to put aside their in-fighting to steal the knowledge of a secret society? One Last Job features six factions (three for each side), each with their own unique strategies and flavor.<br/><br/>",

You are in a race across the 25 laboratory cards between you and your control panels. Each player gets a 'Slipstream Gun' card that allows them to warp themselves or others to different dimensions. Some dimensions contain cards that make the trip across the board easier, while other dimensions make the journey more perilous. Players must balance their urge to race across the board with their need to blast other players into neighboring dimensions. To win, a player must make it across the lab to their own control panel.<br/><br/>Each turn every player gets to perform one movement action and one 'Slipstream Gun' action. The movement action allows the players to move their token to a neighboring card, edging ever closer to their control panel, and victory. For their 'Slipstream Gun' action, players can choose to shoot any player (sending them to another dimension) or they can 'recalibrate' their gun by flipping the card over. This changes what dimension players will go to when shot with the 'Slipstream Gun'.<br/><br/>Players start at one end of a 4x5 card grid. Their control panels are on the opposite side. All of the laboratory cards are face down and as players move on to each card, it is flipped face up and the events on the face of the card are incurred. These can offer benefits like moving forward or gaining an item card. They can also be negative like losing a turn or being sent to the 'Dark World' a dimension in which the cards are much more challenging.<br/><br/>The game ends when any player is able to make it all the way across the board and steps on to the colored control panel that matches their player token.<br/><br/>",

The concept of the game is rather simple. The company you work for, has suddenly been having problems with all of its production machines being sabotaged by an unknown person After hours. The Security footage shows that One of your fellow employees, (players) has been seen tampering with the machines, &quot;After Hours&quot;. The problem is, the security system couldn't detect who it was. Worse, every employee has an alibi, and no one is willing to step forward with any information of evidence.<br/><br/>There for, the Board of Directors, (The Narrator(s)), have decided that one employee will be fired during each &quot;Day Shift&quot; via a 60% majority Employee vote, until the machines are no longer being tampered with each night. To help facilitate this, members of the local law enforcement (Undercover Cop) and the FBI (in larger games of over 15 players), as well as other law enforcement agencies (NSA 20 player game, CIA 25 player game ) to help catch the potential criminals involved. They are also working diligently around the clock to help your company find the culprit. Meeting in secret &quot;After hours&quot; to arrest potential suspects, while also masquerading as a regular employee. Their goal, is to help weed out the real problem person; The elusive The Monkey Wrench and their crew of saboteurs.<br/><br/>However, the members of the Monkey Wrench team have an edge: <br/>Once per &quot;After hours&quot; phase, they can secretly convert one of the other employee towards their goal. If they manage to convert a casual non titled &quot;Employee&quot;, that person becomes a leader within their team, and will be given a &quot;Monkey Wrench&quot; card to show their loyalty. Additionally, depending on the size of the &quot;company (game), other criminal elements can also be expected to try to infiltrate the entire organization. Everything from a simple, &quot;Lunch Thief&quot;, to a &quot;Cat Burglar&quot;, to even members of a Cult, as well as various types of &quot;Hackers&quot;, Espionage experts and even a Corporate embezzler. Each with their own &quot;After hours&quot; abilities that can be used by the Monkey Wrench team, IF they can figure out who within the company is what. Which keeps the members of Law enforcement busy during the game, and helps ensure that the Monkey Wrench team will over throw the company.<br/><br/>Fortunately; the Law enforcement team, (Security guard, Undercover cop, FBI, CIA, NSA.. etc..), do have a extra tools in their wheel house to counter this influx of added trouble. For starters at the end of every &quot;After hours&quot; phase, the company &quot;Security Guard&quot; has the ability to The &quot;sense&quot; when another Employee can been involved with an illicit activity that evening. While the Undercover cop, once per After hours round can &quot;Arrest&quot; a single potential suspect. That player is then removed from game the next subsequent &quot;Day shift&quot;. While the FBI agent, has the power to literally &quot;Fire&quot; anyone one person in the company. Either as a secret executive action during the &quot;After hours&quot; round, or by revealing themselves to the other players as a member of law Enforcement. Upon which they can then have executive power to remove the undercover CEO, or members of upper management and even overthrow their power position within the game. While the NSA has the power to make various &quot;hacking' actions, while the CIA player, has the ability to be a spy in any group, and never reveal themselves, unless they want to. Each member of Law Enforcement, are thus granted unique abilities to help them thwart the dastardly goals of the criminal elements in game. However, in turn, each has their own requirements that they must fulfill in order to win the game.<br/><br/>However; the rest of the employees, and neutral parties can also use their individual abilities, as well as their natural powers of social deduction, interaction, and situational perceptions to determine who they should &quot;vote&quot; against during the &quot;Day shift&quot; round. That way they can work together to have 1 of their fellow employees (Players), removed from game as a group in hopes to help the Law Enforcement players remove threats from the game, and win by power of democratic unity.<br/><br/>So its up to you fellow employee&hellip;<br/><br/>Will you side with the Monkey Wrench and take down the company? <br/>Will you help the Corporate Security to weed out the problem person? <br/>Or... are you secretly the Monkey Wrench, all along? Manipulating everyone to help you shut down the company.<br/><br/>General game play:<br/>Each player is given 4 cards at the beginning of the game:<br/><br/>1 - &quot;Day shift&quot; card, which denotes their public role within the company, that every other player is completely aware of. This card reflects that players normal operations within the company during the day, while they are working. It further operates as  each players &quot;titled&quot; position within a standard normal office environment. Each titled position, is sometimes granted certain abilities, that are usually made public to all players in play, during the &quot;Day shift&quot; phase.<br/><br/>1 - &quot;After hours&quot; card. which designates the given players roles, duties and Private activities when they are not at work, during the &quot;After hours&quot; phase of the game. During this phase of game play, some players are lumber into various secret shadow groups, that operate in secret. Some of them are trying to resolve the crime within the company. Others are trying to ruin the company, by either overthrowing it (Such as the Monkey Wrench), or corrupting the internal operations of the company. While others yet still, have absolutely little value, or influence upon the companies operations, and function as nothing more than benign red herrings, to offset the various groups investigations.<br/><br/>1 - &quot;Vote/ Fire&quot; card. This Operates as each individual players ability to either support another players choice of someone that they believe should be removed from play, (The &quot;Vote&quot; side of the card), by holding the card up above their head, showing that they cast a vote in support of the accuser against the one person they believe should be removed from game. Or on their &quot;Current player&quot; turn (When they have the &quot;Current player&quot; puck in hand), they may select one player in the room to be &quot;Fired&quot; from game, by pointing the card at the person they suspect is guilty, or should be removed from game. If they manage to gain a 65% majority supporting vote from the other remaining players in the game, the selected person is removed from game, revealing their &quot;After hours&quot; card(s). They then regardless of how the vote ended, had the card off to the next player to their Left.<br/><br/>1 - &quot;Gestures&quot; card. This card is a reference card of common hand gestures used during the &quot;After hours&quot; phase of the game. This helps players know what other players in the group they are part of are saying to them, and allows them to communicate in a sort of crude sign language with each other and the Narrators.<br/><br/><br/><br/>Average game time: <br/>15 minutes for a 7 to 10 person game<br/>30 minutes for a 10 to 15 person game<br/>45 minutes for a 15 to 20 person game<br/>60 minutes for a 20 to 30 person gameIntended age of play:<br/>This game is intended for persons 16 years or older. However, the production website says &quot;18&quot;, only because the options, are 12 or 18. The content that is questionable, within the game, is sexually suggestive adult humor, found within 4 &quot;After hours&quot; cards. Which are not essential for general game play, and may be removed as needed for smaller games, of less than 25 persons playing, if persons playing the game are not age appropriate for the setting.<br/><br/>Number of players:<br/>A basic game consists of at least 7 to 10 players:<br/>Advanced games can handle 11 to 33 players.<br/><br/>Please note, however that for every 10 &quot;Employee&quot; players in the game, 1 &quot;Board member&quot; (Narrator), will be needed, as this will help the Narrator's to be able to manage remembering who is what position, has been fired, or changed roles within the game. A &quot;Employee Roster&quot; is provided within the game to help facilitate this, however larger games can get very confusing quickly, and to accommodate this, it's strongly advised to use 1 additional Narrator per 10 players.<br/><br/>Contents:<br/>1 - 60 second timer <br/>1 - 120 second timer <br/>1 - pencil <br/>1 - &quot;Employee Roster&quot; score pad (Player role tracker) <br/>1 - &quot;Current player&quot; card <br/>30 - &quot;Hand gesture&quot; reference cards <br/>30 - &quot;Voting/ &quot;Fire&quot; cards <br/>8 - Special effect cards (Used to reflect game modifiers, such as &quot;Lunch Thief&quot;, Hacks, or other rule modifiers) <br/>37 - &quot;Day Shift&quot; - Character employment cards (These roles, Everyone in play will know about)<br/>93 - &quot;After hours&quot; split between different &quot;Hobbies&quot;, &quot;Scandals&quot;, &quot;Skill's&quot;, &amp; &quot;Moonlighting&quot; jobs. <br/>1 - 40 page &quot;Employee's Manuel&quot; (Rule book) <br/>1 - 32 page &quot;Occupational Directory&quot; (Card Description book)<br/>1 - Deluxe sized box.

This was produced by the &quot;Spellfire Triumverate&quot;: Mike Huebbe (repressenting the judges), Steve Naus (representing retail), and Hayden William Courtland (representing the fans).  Again, based on fan suggestions, they created a 99 card set.  However, they added a new concept to Spellfire that has been in Dungeons &amp; Dragons for years: dice.  Many cards required rolls to find their effects or level.  While protested by some fans, the set has gotten general approval and is the most recent part of the canon and tournament scene.  These cards, like Inquisition, can be downloaded and have an un-official guide in process (Grading a Millenium).

Players will almost certainly need to cooperate on some level if they wish to win, the key is how and when to help each other out.<br/><br/>The game consists of a single repeated round sequence until a winner is determined. Each player starts with a Character card; which gives them a unique player ability and a starting Rune drawn, all of which are randomly dealt. Players then all draw loot cards which make up the resource they use to complete trials and hopefully obtain more runes.<br/><br/>A round consists of players completing personal trials, trading of runes, and a group event. A player wins when they have completed a sets, either the same colour with one of each symbol, or the same symbol with one of each colour. The main focus comes from player interactions during the trials and trading parts to the round, with players deciding whether cooperation is personally beneficial enough to risk helping an opponent.<br/><br/>A game can last anywhere from 20 to 40 mins depending on group size, and is balanced in such a way as to count noone out until the very end.<br/><br/>",

As the Earth is removed of most humans, nature has decided to take back what is left, to consume the land with their plants once more.<br/><br/>The final Battle for earth begins!<br/><br/><br/>This is a strategy game for 2 - 5 players, where you build your base, gain resources, and send units to build or attack.<br/><br/>The game takes place on a 10 by 10 grid, with each player choosing a race, then placing them at the relevant starting location (dependent on the number of players). Each player then takes it in turns to spawn units, take two actions for each unit (move, build or attack), constructing buildings that will either give them money (for building and upgrades), weapon tokens (for attacking and defending) for creating more units (for making actions). Players can build in an empty space, so long as they have the resources, however if the space has an enemy building, they can attack+build (redemption!) to create a building of one level higher than that attacked (for the cost of a lower level building). After each player has taken a turn, you roll for obstacles (Meteorites, etc) which can land anywhere and destroy buildings, whilst also being &quot;Redeemed&quot; by players to give them an easy higher level building.<br/><br/>Each race has their own goal, such as to own the majority of the board, along with a unique ability that aids them in this goal.<br/><br/>Once a player has reached this goal, they win the game after one more round.<br/><br/>",

The Christmas or other holiday special? The animated series? The musical episode? Fan fiction? The special edition or director's cut? Those questions have been turned into a game that's fun to play.<br/><br/>The goal is to work collaboratively and competitively to get your own personal canon of up to seven cards to match the central canon, which everyone creates together, as closely as possible.<br/><br/>Each person begins with a hand of five cards. There is a draw pile face down, seven spaces in the center for the collaboratively-determined canon (to and from which any player may place or take cards), seven spaces in front of you for your own canon, and a spot for a discard pile where cards are placed face up. The draw pile and discard pile should be oriented the opposite way from the seven canon slots, so that they are not confused with one another.<br/>You can place a card from your hand onto an identical card either in the central canon or your own personal canon.<br/><br/>The game ends when only one player has cards remaining, and makes one final move. Any additional cards that player has then go on the discard pile.<br/><br/>One&rsquo;s score at the end of play is determined by:<br/>1) Multiplying each card in one&rsquo;s personal canon by each matching card in the central canon, and<br/>2) Subtracting one point for each individual card in one&rsquo;s own canon that does not have an equivalent in the central canon.<br/><br/>Note that there is no penalty related to cards still in your hand if you are the last player holding cards. These are simply discarded. Only what is in your canon determines your score.<br/><br/>",

        "description": "Also nicknamed 'Fashion Fighters', and based on the popular Gaki no Tsukai series, this card game replicates one of their most famous challenges:  Can five heroes (or more!) transform into their super costumes while not caring to recall which hero they actually are?<br/><br/>You take on the role of 5 &quot;Powered&quot; Ranger style heroes in 5 unique colors: Red Ranger, Blue Ranger, Green Ranger, Gold Ranger, and Pink Ranger.  Yet, you are all careless, and always forget which ones you are. Also, NO table talking is allowed because you are also too proud to call each other to ask.<br/><br/>Your goal is to show up to the battle in a unique Ranger suit, matching no other Ranger's color.  Matching another ranger simply will not do, and you will refuse to fight and just go home.  It's embarrassing.<br/><br/>Basic rules: Players have 5 cards each in their starting hands: one card for each of the 5 costume colors (add more colored cards for more players than 5).  Choose a starting player (a lead Ranger) and everyone secretly picks a color costume to wear and puts that matching color card face down in front of them.  Starting with the leader and going clockwise, you will flip your card face up in front of you and yell &quot;[Insert color you played] RANGER GO!&quot;.<br/><br/>If all the colors are different, you fight the threat and save the day.  If not, you take any non matching cards into your hand or discard any colors that matched another player (place the discarded card in front of you, face up, so everyone can see what color you lost).<br/><br/>You refuse to ever experience that humiliation again and throw the costume out.  If the same color card is lost by all players, the game is impossible to win, and you instantly lose.<br/><br/>Lastly, (this can be a variant or base rule, your choice) a Ranger will never show up in the same costume twice in a row, so for the following round you must pick a different color to play (eg., yellow, yellow, blue is not allowed, but yellow, blue, yellow is).  Players need to use deduction and pay attention to what costumes are out of play to come out on top!<br/><br/>",

In the game, players encounter fantastic creatures like the towering Daikon, a radish demon, or Slime, an adorable yet dangerous pink blob. The art is colorful and is reminiscent of a colored version of Japanese calligraphy.<br/><br/>The players compete in the Banquet of Seven Suns, a cooking competition hosted by the Emperor. The dishes earn points, and the goal of the game is to get the most points awarded for the cooked dishes. The ingredients required for the dishes are sometimes guarded by monsters and demons; other times, the monsters and demons are the ingredients! The players travel the variable game board with a hero outfitted with unique abilities and proficient in several equipment disciplines. Different random quests award money and loot in the form of weapons, armor, scrolls and other equipment. Each player can also improve their abilities by recruiting up to two companions to build up their group.<br/><br/>The players take two actions in each turn and have to get the most out of the limited turns they get. The game time is limited by the number of event cards in the event pile. Once the event pile is depleted, the players each get one last turn. The game ends by scoring the dishes. The player with the most points wins. If two players are tied, their groups of heroes will duel to determine the winner.<br/><br/>",

This was a dramatic, rapidly changing period of Mediterranean history, time of civilizations building and destroyng. Time of Punic wars. Let's look at four major players on this time:   <br/>- Carthage Republic was a trading empire with vast lands of northern eastern Africa and Iberian Peninsula south to Ebro river.  <br/>- Egypt kingdom was a part of Alexander the Great Empire under Ptolemy kings with important trade and cultural influence.  <br/>- Hellenistic Greece was still dreaming about legacy of Alexander the Great and Greek empire past.  <br/>- Roman Republic was a rising force in the northern part of Mediterranean with impressive technological and military advances.<br/><br/>Trade And War - Ancient Mediterranean is a strategy board game with a balanced combination of a trade and war activity. You are playing as a ruler of Carthage, Egypt, Greece or Rome civilizations. Build and expand your Empire and win the game!<br/><br/>You perform trade with resources, and builds ships, caravans, legions and improves cities with buildings like ports, trade posts, barracks, walls and a Wonder, that will give you an important advantage.<br/><br/>Random resource map makes every game different and unique. Taxation and expenses determine the money balance required to build a great civilization. Ships and caravans move resources and legions from city to city. Legions attack gives the ability to expand the player&rsquo;s Empire. Ships and armies battle determines the strongest and luckiest Empire. Each building and a win in a battle is rewarded by victory points. Score the most of victory points to win!<br/><br/>Ancient Mediterranean Trade and War map is created based on actual cities (some of them still have the same name now) and trade routes in the end of 3rd century BC.<br/><br/>There are three main phases in the game each turn:<br/><br/>- Event phase<br/><br/><br/>     God's blessing will determine what player is first to move <br/>     Event card play determines turn specific advantages and disadvantages. <br/>     Player determines the turn strategy and civilization priorities. <br/><br/><br/>- Trade phase<br/><br/><br/>     Each player can buy and sell resources - grain, pottery, metal, glass and olives. <br/>     Silver and gold coins are used for exchange. <br/>     Resources and coins can be used to buy a building or a Wonder. <br/>     Victory Points are given for the new building or a Wonder. <br/>     Taxation and expenses depend on player's cities and player's legions. <br/>     Player can buy trade, war and move cards <br/>     Player can buy ships, caravans or legions in player's city if it has building for that. <br/>     Athens Parthenon was used as a treasury in Ancient Greece. <br/>     Player can use Trade cards. <br/><br/><br/>- Move and War phase<br/><br/>-Move<br/><br/><br/>     Map consists on tiles for moving ships and caravans. <br/>     Each player can move ships on the sea and caravans on land. <br/>     Dices determine how many tiles to move ship or caravan<br/>     Caravans and ships could move resources and legions from city to city. <br/>     Desert or mountain tile takes extra move. <br/>     Trade ship sinks in the deep sea unless player has Alexandria Lighthouse. <br/>     Alexandria Lighthouse gives extra move to player who owns it. <br/>     Golden Temple and Spring of Life await player in the end of journey. <br/>     Player can use Move cards. <br/><br/><br/>-War<br/><br/><br/>     Legion on ship/caravan can attack city/ship/caravan. <br/>     Up to three legions can travel by war ship. <br/>     Ship/caravan can attack another ship/caravan. <br/>     Roman Forum gives extra attack to player who owns it. <br/>     Carthage Citadel gives extra defense to player who owns it. <br/>     Life token can be used to ressurect lost ship or caravan or legion. <br/>     Victory Points are given to a winner of a battle. <br/>     Player can use War cards.<br/><br/><br/>See more details on <a target='_blank' href=\"http://tradeandwar.com\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer noopener\">http://tradeandwar.com</a><br/><br/>",

Their thirst for treasure finds them with a trove of artifacts.<br/><br/>The Orcs, who control the wild lands of the west. They worship the mighty Red Dragon.<br/><br/>Players take turns, buying artifacts to use in battle, recruiting forces and moving armies to collect gold and capture castles. All while a horde of wild dragons move through the land, decimating everything that comes before them.<br/><br/>Battle plans are made in secret and simultaneously revealed. Magic artifacts are used to support your armies. Even the winner of a battle can suffer terrible attrition.<br/><br/>Deals made publicly between players are magically bound, and must be honored, if possible. This, along with the tremendous cost of battle, adds a strong political component to the game.<br/><br/>Players may ally and share their advantages, but there can still be only one winner. The first player to end a turn controlling 3 or more castles has won the game. If there is no winner after 8 turns, then the Red Dragon still rules the land, and it's patron, the Orcs, win the game.<br/><br/>This game is licensed Creative Commons Share-Alike 4.0.<br/><br/>",

        "description": "BraveGuard is a rpg-inspired strategy game that captures the spirit of high-adventure in a fantasy world. Players control a Hero with unique abilities as they explore the open-world map, defeating Encounters and gaining Treasure on their quest for victory. A core set of simple rules that make it quick to get started, but multiple Scenarios to choose from allow players to either work together in a cooperative game, or go head-to-head for victory in a competitive game. This variety of scenarios provides the option of either a lighter game or one with more depth.<br/><br/>Each game starts with the Heroes in central town, from there players choose their own path. The map is divided into several areas with their own types of increasingly difficult Encounters - beginning to the relative ease of the Plains, into the dense Forests further out, then giving way to the dangers of the ancient Ruins. In the furthest reaches, players will find a variety of unique points of interest, like the Great Tree or Eternal Volcano, which will be their goal for many of the unique Quests. There are also the Fallen Palaces, home to the great Fiends - the most challenging Encounter for any Hero.<br/><br/>The Encounter system is the heart of most turns in every Scenario. After moving, players draw an Encounter card matching the type of space they are in. There are two options for how to approach each Encounter, each corresponding to one of the 4 stats - Combat, Agility, Magic, or Intelligence. Players must use try to determine which stat they think each option is and evaluate their various bonuses to determine which option is best for them. After deciding, you'll flip the card over to see the required stat and target number, then roll the die and add your bonuses. Win and you get a Treasure, lose and you're down a Heart. Lose all your Hearts and you must spend the next turn healing up at the nearest Camp. At any point during your turn you can choose to use one of your Hero's unique powers to help you in a number of ways.<br/><br/>BraveGuard was developed with the goal of being a game that offers seasoned gamers a quick &amp; compelling adventure, but also offers enough clarity and lighter options to be welcoming to new gamers...young or old! At it's core the game offers choice every turn, character development, and serves as an introduction to the core concepts to help create the next generation of serious gamers!<br/><br/>",

Having their numbers decimated in the android wars, in which they sought their emancipation, they now seek to inject their consciousness into cyberspace and steal the secret to sentient life from the humans in order to replenish their numbers.<br/><br/>The board is comprised of spaces connected by pathways, representing various systems which can be hacked.  Players start with a 12 card deck and a 6 card hand and cooperate to survive while competing for victory points.  They roll dice against their hack points to hack systems and, if successful, get to add better cards to their deck.  If unsuccessful they generate &quot;trace&quot; which may draw enemy A.I. called &quot;hunters&quot; to their location.  If more than one player hacks the same system (i.e. space on the board) the threat of a &quot;tracers&quot; attack grows, tracers being strange and powerful creatures that roam cyberspace.<br/><br/>The goal is to hack two well protected systems and acquire the tokens there which represent the human data, but they will have to have strong hacking abilities and protective gear to overcome that challenge.<br/><br/>",

Your goal is to be the faction whose legacy will shape humanity's future by collecting Legacy Cards representing your accomplishments. <br/> The core mechanic involves playing action cards from your hand to gather the game's three resource types, spend those resources on ships, outposts, cities, and technology, and move your ships to engage in combat or conquest.<br/><br/>There are six different kinds of Legacy Card: Expansion (having outposts on lots of planets), Empire (having lots of cities), Enlightenment (researching high-level technology), Extermination (destroying cities and outposts during conquest), Exploration (devoting resources to the renovation of derelict warp gates), and the Exalted (destroying &quot;Exalted Guardians&quot;, which are the ancient autonomous war machines that still protect a few special planets).<br/><br/>The first player to collect 8 Legacy Cards is the winner. Players track their progress on the Legacy Track, which triggers events whenever the first player reaches each new legacy total.<br/><br/>&mdash;description from the designer<br/><br/>",

Desperate to find a new impact sport for the masses, the TV networks sanctioned a think-tank of programmers, machinists, engineers, military experts, and game theorists. <br/>Within two years, the game of Cyberball had been born.  <br/>     <br/>The whiny, mentally stunted athletes of football had been replaced by 18 feet tall gleaming robots, adorned with spikes and sponsor adverts. These robo-athletes did not complain, ask for more money, do drugs, or get arrested.....they just rocked! And rock they did. In little time, the Cyberball League far eclipsed the popularity of all other sports combined. The crunch of metal on any given Sunday combined with spectacular explosions garnered fans from every walk of life. Soon, the Cyberball League included dozens of teams from all over the world. The corporations pumped millions of credits into this monster they had created and reaped huge rewards.<br/><br/>Now the year is 2072, and Cyberball is the most anticipated sport on the planet. All teams compete for the Cyberbowl at season's end, where the two top teams slug it out for the coveted 'Assassin's Cup'. As a Cyberball coach, it is your job to secure the best sponsors and coach your team to the promise land. The season can be grueling for a rookie coach. Use earned credits to your advantage and field the best players, while destroying other team's star players. Embrace the thrill of giant metal machines mauling each other. Become a Cyberball coaching legend!<br/><br/><br/>

<br/><br/><br/>The futuristic and brutal world of Cyberball comes to life with this miniatures game. Choose a sponsor, upgrade your players, and prepare for gridiron mayhem.<br/><br/>The goal of this game is to outscore and brutalize the other team to receive monetary bonuses from the league and sponsors. Football fans will find themselves right at home with this 2 player game. To win games, you must score touchdowns. Once in possession of the ball, the offense has six plays to diffuse the ball by either passing midfield or getting in the endzone. The ball gradually heats up: cool - lukewarm - warm - hot - sizzling - critical. If a critical ball is not diffused, it will explode at the conclusion on the play. If a robo-athlete is holding the ball, they will be obliterated. The game is 7 on 7 robot football with a colorful cast of characters. Here are brief descriptions of the deadly participants:<br/><br/>QB - The offensive captain is the linchpin of any good team. Unlike other robo-athletes, the Quarterback has legs which allow for quick lateral movement, but not flat out speed. The QB's weakness is its dreadful lack of armor.<br/><br/>RB - An outstanding combination of speed and armor. The Runningback is often the workhorse of the offense. Many coaches find that an upgraded RB becomes a scoring machine.<br/><br/>PB - A new addition to Cyberball, the Powerback is gaining popularity across the league. Being able to run or pass the ball, make the PB an unpredictable asset.<br/><br/>WR - Perhaps the greatest offensive threat on the gridiron, the Wide Receiver is a true speed demon. Although lightly armored, a WR speeding down the field with the ball is rarely caught.<br/><br/>TE - Tight Ends are cheap to produce and make good supplemental blockers on the line of scrimmage. Some coaches are able to use TEs to good effect in a short passing game.<br/><br/>LM - Lineman are the bullies of the gridiron. Their main responsibilities are to block along the offensive line and make tackles along the defensive line. On tracks, they are slow but very maneuverable.<br/><br/>CB - The fastest player on the defense is the Cornerback. They are primarily charged with covering the elusive WRs and making an occasional blitz. What they lack in armor, they make up for with speed.<br/><br/>SF - Safeties are equally good at stopping the run or covering the pass. With respectable armor and above average speed, a good SF can be counted on to stop the offense dead in their tracks.<br/><br/>LB - The intimidator of the gridiron, Linebackers have very think armor and decent speed. Although able to cover short passes, these monsters are better at dominating the line of scrimmage and dismantling opposing QBs.<br/><br/>Teams in the Cyberball league utilize sponsors to supplement their income. It is a symbiotic relationship. Teams make thousands of credits each season for slapping sponsor decals onto their robo-athletes. Sponsors get valueable exposure on national TV. Deals are struck between each game and it is not uncommon to see a team switch sponsors frequently. Each coach selects one sponsor before the game.<br/><br/>This can be played as a stand-alone game as well as in season mode. In season mode, players can save up their money to buy bigger and better bots.<br/><br/>",

        "description": "As described on the box, Vir Sivir's Ramayana - The Game is played to find Rama using the locations of the Ramayana epic on a map of India. The purpose of the game is to allow the player to learn and understand the Ramayana in an easier format. The game can also be played at three different difficulty levels based on the player's gaming abilities.<br/><br/>The game play in general will have the players starting in different locations in India. They will have event cards that each represent an event that happens to Rama, and the location that they occurred in. Players will roll a special pair of dice to determine where on the board they can movie. Depending on the roll and the space they are on, they may also be able to draw special boon cards. Once a player is in one of the map locations, they may discard one event card corresponding to that location, and can play more than one event if they also discard a boon. Players who previously played an event card at the same location must pick their cards back up, but can avoid this by playing a boon. The first player to discard all of their cards is the winner.<br/><br/>The higher levels of game play will introduce a mystery event, where players have to deduce the mystery event by noting which events other players have played. Players also may ask the other players if they have event cards corresponding to the locations they are on to place in front of themselves. Once a player has seven event cards in front of them, they may see if they've correctly deduced the card...either winning the game, or being eliminated/receiving penalties. Boon cards now also have added abilities that will allow players to block paths of movement on the board, prevent players from asking for others' cards, or blocking others' card abilities. Players must also now discard boon cards as an entry fee into the event locations.<br/><br/>The highest level of game play also introduces the Kodanda spinner (named after Rama's legendary bow). Each player will be designated as day, night, or twilight depending on their start space. The spinner must be spun at the start of each turn, changing the balance of power for each player, allowing them to roll an extra die or collect extra boons, or causing them to roll one less die and being unable to collect boons or even reveal their mystery event deduction.<br/><br/>",

Although there are plenty of sci-fi wargames, PMC 2640 has many interesting features which make it unique and very enjoyable.<br/><br/>PMC 2640 is designed as a &lsquo;true company scale&rsquo; wargame, which means that it runs smoothly both with a few as well as a few dozen units on the battlefield. This was achieved by eliminating sophisticated, but unnecessary special rules, and limiting the number of counters to morale markers only, represented by D6 dice. The ruleset itself is compact and elegant, written in simple, &ldquo;international&rdquo; English, leaving no place for vagueness and multiple interpretations. On the other hand, PMC 2640 offers countless possibilities, as the rulebook contains a few dozen of unit entries, six scenarios and seven terrain generators, all of which ensure that no two games will look the same. The classic alternate activation (with small balancing modifications) makes the game fast and addictive.<br/><br/>",

In the first phase, the Build Phase, players work to build a maze of cards in a 5 x 5 grid.<br/><br/>After the maze is built, the Ingression Phase begins.  Players navigate the maze by creating new paths on the grid.  At the beginning of a turn, a play may draw a new tile and replace a tile already on the board, or turn a tile to create a new path. One of these actions must be taken each turn, and the player also must move if possible.<br/><br/>To win, a player must move their pawn to the other side before their opponent reaches theirs.<br/><br/>The game consists of 39 maze tiles and 2 home tiles, two movement cubes (blank red and blue colored dice), and a small full color instruction manual.  It is designed to be small, portable, and easy to learn.  Ingression can be taught to new players in as little as 5 minutes.

Kicking Class brings an enticingly comical twist to high school. Players take on the role of students going through a whirlwind of hilariously relatable high school faux pas. In the game, you will race against your fellow students to come out on top and claim a full-ride scholarship to the university of your dreams.<br/><br/>Unlike your typical scholarships, which judge you based on boring things like your GPA or school contributions, the K.A. scholarship has developed its own unique ranking system. To claim this scholarship, you will need to pass classes, spread rumors, throw parties, and do whatever it takes to get the upper hand over your fellow students.<br/><br/>Whether you strive for popularity or bury your face behind textbooks, the options are endless. Now get ready to kick some class!<br/><br/>OVERVIEW<br/><br/>The game takes place over the 4 years of high school. Each year there are 3 trimesters, in which you will be taking classes. To pass a class, you will roll skill dice and see if you meet the requirements. If you pass, you keep the card and gain the reward. If you fail, you must draw from the dreaded failure deck!<br/><br/>You will earn scholarship points (SP) for passing classes, being popular, and taking the ACT. At the end of the game, whoever has the most scholarship points wins!<br/><br/>",

Despite all the efforts to prevent it, the monsters manage to scaped to our realm and transformed the pacate village of Ashwood into the lands of Witchland. Rumors of the Witchland reached the ears of the Hallowhood Guild, an ancient guild of monster hunters who had for generations fought dark forces in various corners of the world. Over the centuries, fighting monsters became no longer just a chore, but also Hallowhood's greatest pastime and its members eagerly awaited an opportunity like this to prove themselves!<br/><br/>Witchland is a semi-cooperative game. Players must work together to find the terrible monsters that are ravaging Ashwood village and defeat them before the planets line up, but at the same time compete with each other to see who will be the great hunter of this adventure.<br/><br/>At the end of the game, if players succeed in their mission, the player with the most victory points will be the winner. When the planets align, the players failed to protect the world from shadow monsters and now no bet matters anymore. Perishing in darkness is all that remains for humanity.<br/><br/>Teamwork is critical to group victory, overly selfish actions or incorrect decisions can lead to everyone's defeat! But remember: there can be only one winner!<br/><br/>During the game, play as one of the Hallowhood members and look for clues to identify the whereabouts of terrible monsters<br/>while dealing with a horde of angry peasants. To do this, collect ingredients, make potions and acquire powerful artifacts that will help you through this nightmare. Make the right choices when dealing with countless crossroads along your journey and remember: the enemy is always on the prowl.<br/><br/>&mdash;description from the designer<br/><br/>",

It is based on Czech version of public domain card game Crazy Eights (&ldquo;Pr&scaron;&iacute;&rdquo;). Santa&rsquo;s Game introduces new rules and additional cards. Although the theme is Christmas oriented, the game is wonderful to be played at any time during the whole year.<br/><br/>It is quick and easy to learn, yet can be more fun and strategic than appears on a first sight. Being in a category of games based on random draw, clever strategy can sometimes eliminate randomness a lot.<br/><br/>Game contains 110 cards and rules.<br/><br/>Cards are divided into 5 suits, 22 cards per suit. There are four suits of colored cards (red, green, blue, yellow) and one suit of special cards (grey). Colored cards are: Reindeer/Number 1 to 9 (72 cards), Gift (8 cards), Christmas Tree (8 cards). Special cards are: Santa Claus (8 cards), Santa&rsquo;s Sleigh (8 cards), Snowman (4 cards), Elf (2 cards).<br/><br/>At the beginning of the round, each player receives 7 cards. The goal is to get rid of all the cards in player&rsquo;s hand by matching last played card on a discard pile.<br/><br/>Player&rsquo;s turns are taken in a clockwise direction. A player can make only one action during each turn. An action is considered to discard a card, to take a card from the deck, to pass the penalty and to take penalty cards. Each turn player discards only one card to a discard pile (with the exception of Santa's Sleigh, where is player allowed to discard multiple cards). Each card has a function, which is executed after player discards it.<br/><br/>Based on a card on a discard pile, player can only discard the same color (red, blue, green and yellow) or the same value of the cards (same number, Gift, Tree). Special cards (grey) may be discarded over any card, except if player is receiving penalty. If player does not want or cannot discard any card, they must take one card from the deck.<br/><br/>Cards:<br/><br/>Reindeer &ndash; represents numbers 1 to 9<br/>Gift &ndash; any chosen player at the table gets 2 penalty cards<br/>Christmas Tree &ndash; the next player&rsquo;s turn is skipped<br/>Santa Claus &ndash; changes color<br/>Santa&rsquo;s Sleigh &ndash; discards more Reindeer at the same time<br/>Snowman &ndash; passes the penalty to next player in the sequence<br/>Elf &ndash; returns player to the game<br/><br/>&mdash;description from the publisher<br/><br/>",

In VoB:Body Count players take on the role of directors and try to make their own vignette scenes using Scene cards featuring characters, weapons, and locations from the movies!  Each Scene card type has a Fear value that is used to determine how many Victims a director may claim in a scene and how many bonus cards a director may draw when a scene is successfully wrapped.<br/><br/>To create a scene, a director must collect a Killer Scene card, a Weapon Scene card, and a Location Scene card.  Once each of these cards are in play in front of the director, a Victim card may be played into the scene as well.  Gore and Effect cards can increase or decrease the Fear value of a scene.  Scene, Gore and Effect cards may be played in any scene on the table by any director during that director's turn.  Mess up the other directors scenes with Wild cards.  Wrap a scene quickly and don't get stuck with low Fear value cards!<br/><br/>The first director to claim three Victims in their Body Count is the winner!<br/><br/>&mdash;description from the publisher<br/><br/>",

Each scenario presents a plot, objective, and special rules for the gameplay. Certain scenarios introduce special mechanics that change the dynamic of the game. For example, the second scenario introduces a traitor mechanic in which one player secretly works against the rest of the players to accomplish his/her own goals.<br/><br/>The exploration of the house is based on a randomly ordered deck of Room Tiles, so each play through is different in how the house is laid out. Items, enemies, and events are also encountered in a random order, which also serves to differentiate each play through and adds to the replayability.<br/><br/>&mdash;description from the designer<br/><br/>",

The Fox is a tricky scoundrel that shows up in all the wrong places and chases off the Hens and destroys their Eggs! It&rsquo;s your job to keep the Fox out of your Henhouse and keep your Hens safe so they can produce as many Eggs as possible.<br/><br/>In Fox in the Henhouse, each player has only 1 card in their hand and two face down cards in front of them. The two face down cards are called your Henhouse. Hen cards have 1-4 Eggs shown on them. You are attempting to gather the most Eggs into your hand and Henhouse by the end of the Week (7 rounds). In addition to each player's hand and Henhouse are two face down cards in the center of the play area called the Field. On your turn you can select a card from anywhere on the table (cannot take a card from someone's hand).  Once you have selected a card, you can choose which of the two cards you now hold to keep and which to put back, then other players take turns following the same format of selecting a card and placing a card.  If a player selects a Fox card they must keep it in their hand unless they are also holding one of the 4 Fox repelling cards (The Farmer, The Farmwife, The Farm Dog or The Rooster).  The 4 Fox repelling cards also have special abilities when played face up to help you manipulate the cards in play.  At the end of the Week all players total up their Eggs and take the number of Egg tokens they have accumulated.  After 4 weeks have been played then the player with the most Eggs wins!<br/><br/>",

Players take on the role of kings competing to fill newly discovered land with their own buildings, while trying to block others from doing the same. Each player will use resources, bribe officials, and send armies in order to create the dominant kingdom and claim the land as their own.<br/><br/>In Vanquisher, players will take turns performing actions and constructing buildings in a limited map area. The area consists of a grid, where players will place their newly constructed buildings. But careful planning is essential, since buildings can only be constructed without them touching, a specification that can be used to a player&rsquo;s advantage. Each constructed building will also give a special benefit to the player which they can use throughout the game to assist them in collecting resources, using army tokens to block other players, and allow them to use additional actions during their turns. A player can additionally use actions to bribe officials, which take form of cards that will assist them in creating a more efficient engine to claim the most land.<br/><br/>The game ends after 12 rounds, and players get points from territorial control, and bonus points for achievements, money, and certain buildings.<br/><br/>This game was made available as a free Print and Play by Ngb Designs.<br/><br/>From the Game:<br/>In a realm much like our own, Kings search for undiscovered territory to expand their kingdom.

In this card game players compete to see who's marriage can withstand the challenges many couples face- such as naughty children, money trouble, pesky in-laws and even the much feared sex drought! But don't worry, for each challenge there is a solution.<br/><br/>Game play is pretty simple. The game can be played with up to 4 individuals or 3 pairs(6 players total). Each turn involves drawing one card and playing one card. To win you must play year cards(1 year, 2, 3, 4, 5 or 10 years)to reach the total of 50 years before your opponents do. Before you can play any year cards you must play a married card. Once you're officially married you can start accumulating years.<br/><br/>On your turn you draw a card: <br/><br/>     from the top of the discard pile or <br/>     the top of the deck<br/><br/><br/>Then you choose ONE of the following as your play a card action: <br/><br/>     Playing a card on yourself such as a Year card, Solution card or Immunity card(which protects you from specific Setback cards).<br/>     Playing a card on an opponent such as a Setback card or Divorce card to slow down their progress. <br/>     Or if you're unable to do either of those, simply discard a card. <br/><br/><br/>If you have either a divorce card or setback card played on you, you can not play any new year cards till those cards have been resolved. Marriage cards resolve Divorce cards, Solution cards resolve Setback cards of the same color.<br/><br/>&mdash;description from the designer<br/><br/>",

TH will integrate armor, infantry, artillery and air support for miniatures and hex-based board gaming. The unit level is individual vehicles &amp; aircraft with squads &amp; teams for infantry. Each player will command up to a reinforced combined arms company, confronting the same challenges and fortunes of war as real tank commanders and infantry squad leaders in combat with the enemy.<br/><br/>They will advance to contact, identify and react to threats, engage targets, and then adapt their own battle plans as necessary. TH encourages the use the tactics and strategies, including those taken directly from the real manuals, and features weapons platforms that perform with a high degree of detail &amp; accuracy.<br/><br/>What sets this game apart from other games at this scale &amp; subject? Treadheads centers around the concept of &ldquo;Time in Action&rdquo; as a way to simulate the interactive and simultaneous actions of units in a historical 1:1 engagement. This timing synchronizes movement and firing commands and eliminates additional rules and traditional Sequence of Play for initiative determination, orders phase, opportunity fire and over-watch, while allowing simultaneous movement &amp; target engagement.<br/><br/>TH and the OODA Decision Loop: The principle of the Decision Loop (Observe, Orient, Decide, Act) was developed by USAF Colonel John Boyd. By mastering this process and getting &quot;inside&quot; the cycle, disrupting an opponent's thinking processes, and forcing him to commit to a plan before he's ready, this offers opportunities and pressures for him to make mistakes. That timing aspect of acting before your opponent is what allows you to seize the initiative and exploit it.<br/><br/>",

But beware of fellow tiny people, who are also trying to furnish their homes, and won&rsquo;t hesitate to scuffle with you for the items they want.<br/><br/>What&rsquo;s more, you have to look out for the cat, the ferocious pet of the humans, whose keen senses know when there&rsquo;s a scuffle among the tiny people. Avoid the cat at all costs, or you&rsquo;ll be cat food. Survive the scuffles and the feline wrath, and you&rsquo;ll return with the materials to decorate your home. You can even assemble borrowed items to create more elaborate furniture. If you accomplish your goals for a dream home, you&rsquo;ll be the envy of all tiny people.<br/><br/>This is a card-based game where 3-5 players start of with just a an empty room card. Their ideal dream home is dictated by goal cards drawn at the start of each game. Each turn, item cards are presented and all players simultaneously place their meeples on the items they want to grab. If two or more players go after the same item card, a scuffle breaks out. Scuffles are resolved with dice rolls but if the difference exceeds two, the cat will hear and disrupt the scuffle. Everyone flees and no one gets the item.<br/><br/>Players decorate their room card with the item cards. There are also Assembly cards where players are required to get two or more specified item cards to build into the Assembly. Assemblies score more and give action bonuses. Players may also trade items with each other, expand their tiny house by adding room cards. Play ends when there are no more item cards to grab. Then points are added.

        "description": "During the Middle Ages, the Iberian Peninsula was divided into several small states, Christian kingdoms (in the northern half) and Muslim emirates (in the southern half). Over almost eight centuries, these two cultures went through periods of war and peace, intolerance and coexistence, and the fragile alliances between ones and others kingdoms changed overnight depending on the political interests of each sovereign. (Christians against Muslims, Christians against Christians, Muslims against Muslims), with the Jews as an economic force that exerted as a hinge. Likewise, foreign powers such as the Papacy or the Caliphate also played their cards in the peninsular contest. In &quot;Rex Ib&eacute;ricus&quot; you will have to take control of one of the main six Iberian medieval kingdoms: three Christians (Kingdom of Castile, Kingdom of Aragon and Kingdom of Navarra) and three Muslims (Emirate of Cordoba, Emirate of Granada and Emirate of Valencia). Through political intrigue, diplomacy and war, as well as economic and cultural development, you will have to fight to make your kingdom or emirate become the most powerful on the Peninsula, and be named &quot;Rex Ib&eacute;ricus&quot;.<br/><br/>For this, you will have the opportunity to occupy villages, castles and walled cities, and then build farms, palaces, churches, mosques, synagogues, libraries, towers and lighthouses, which will magnify your kingdom. Likewise, you must recruit armies and build fleets to defend yourself from your dangerous neighbors, and in no case will you do well to neglect the basic nutritional needs of your subjects, since you could face brutal peasant revolts of unpredictable consequences. You must also ensure the defense of your coasts, since the fearsome Viking warriors could land on them and destroy all the wealth of your prosperous State. To help you with these challenges, you will have four historical leaders from each kingdom (Isabella, Ferdinand, Urraca, Abd al-Rahman, Boabdil, Zobeyda ...), each of them provided with special skills depending on the position assigned to them (King, advisor, ambassador, emir, vizier ...), and you can also use them to seal alliances with other kingdoms through marital links, which will make you join forces to protect yourself from more belligerent third parties, while allowing you to engender heirs (princes and princesses) to ensure the survival of your legacy.<br/><br/>In the same way, using your political influence and the support of your allies in the assembly, you will have the opportunity to reach the cusp of the Iberian Court (common to all peninsular kingdoms), which will allow you to control powerful elite units. Nor should you underestimate the power of the conspiracy, which will allow you to carry out espionage missions, instigate internal revolts and even kill rival monarchs. Finally, you can embark on exciting sea voyages to the East (Rome, Baghdad, Jerusalem and China) in search of external support to implement your political structures and deal with your enemies, although long journeys will never be without danger. Are you prepared to travel to the Middle Ages and enter an exciting world of castles, swords, religious conflicts and palace plots?<br/><br/>",

        "description": "HOW TO PLAY<br/>EleMasters is a 2-8 player game that fosters a blend of competitive and co-op play. The objective of the game is to bond as many Atomo cards as you can on your turn, in order to win.<br/><br/>SETUP<br/>Place the Octomic Ring in the center of the table. <br/>Shuffle the full deck of Atomo Cards.<br/>Deal each player their Hand (9 minus # of players). <br/>All player hands remain face up in front of them as &lsquo;in play&rsquo;.<br/>Place the remaining cards face down on the center of the Octomic Ring as the Atomo Deck. <br/>Player with the highest Valectron count in their hand starts, then counterclockwise.<br/><br/>GAME OVER<br/>The game ends when there are no more Summoned Atomo left on the Octomic Ring to play. When this happens, everyone discards the rest of their hand so only point deck cards remain. <br/><br/>    Long game option: When the Octomic Ring runs out of Atomo cards, reshuffle the discard pile as a new set. Repeat until there are no more summoned Atomo, or no more bonds can be made by any player.<br/><br/><br/>SCORING<br/>The objective, is for each player to Bond as many cards as possible, so that you get to claim them for your Point Deck. <br/>3pts/per Atomo card in your point deck.<br/>1pt/per Valectron on each of those Atomo cards in point deck.<br/>1pt/per Bond made with your point deck during end game scoring.<br/><br/>ROUNDS<br/>The Active Player starts their turn by flipping the top card of the Atomo Deck over to reveal it as the Summoned Atomo for that round.<br/><br/>The Active Player then decides, based on all the cards in front of each player, themselves included, which cards to bond with the Active Atomo. The more cards bonded, the more of them you get to keep &amp; add to your point deck at the end of that round, but also stay aware of how many Valectron points that card has as well.<br/><br/>    Point Deck cards are not &lsquo;in-play&rsquo; to bond to. <br/><br/><br/>As the active player searches for bond combos, the other players should be verifying the bonds being attempted, as well as suggesting bonds that will help themselves as well as the AP. In this way, the game is both co-op as well as competitive.<br/><br/>At the end of each players turn, they should draw enough cards from the Atomo Deck to refill their hand.<br/><br/>Four modes teach you the game by starting simple, then adding mechanics which you can mix and match as you like:<br/><br/>Beginner: Basic Octets.<br/>Casual: Phases to cool &amp; heat Atomo&rsquo;.<br/>EleMagi: Radioactive Isotopes add stabilization complication.<br/>EleMaster: Use correct bond types to ionize Atomo&rsquo; for more bonding options on your turn.<br/><br/>BEGINNER MODE<br/>&quot;Octets&quot;<br/><br/>Rules:<br/>&bull; Form an Octet of Valectrons<br/>&bull; Ignore all other modifiers<br/><br/>&ldquo;Valectron&rdquo; is EleMaster slang for &ldquo;Valence Electron&rdquo;.<br/>For this mode, you just want to create a total of 8 (an Octet) Valectrons around the Summoned Atomo.<br/><br/>To bond a card to the Summoned Atomo, place a hand card from yourself or another player onto a BondBloom (the glowing mineral leaves on the edge of the Octomic Ring). You can bond up to four cards.<br/><br/>For a successful bond, the total of Valectrons around the Summoned Atomo, plus the Valectrons around each bonded Atomo must equal a total of 8. No more, no less.<br/><br/>If you bond, place all the bonded cards into your point deck. If you can&rsquo;t make a bond, discard the Summoned Atomo, return all hand cards to their owners, then end the round and let the next player start their turn.<br/><br/><br/>    In this Beginner mode, if the Summoned Atomo drawn has eight already, you simply add it to your point pile as an automatic point and that ends your turn. This does not apply in the other game modes.<br/><br/><br/>CASUAL MODE<br/>&quot;Phases&quot;<br/><br/>Rules:<br/>&bull; Form an Octet of Valectrons<br/>&bull; Use Phase modifier<br/><br/>Here&rsquo;s where we harness some of the core concepts of chemical bonding through the &lsquo;EleMagic&rsquo; of the Octomic Ring.<br/><br/>Each Atomo has it&rsquo;s own default &lsquo;phase&rsquo; on it which refers to the Heat Energy it contains at standard Earth temperatures, which determines the &lsquo;state&rsquo; it&rsquo;s in.<br/><br/>For example, &ldquo;H2O&rdquo; with low heat energy makes it a Solid we call Ice. Add more heat energy and it &lsquo;melts&rsquo; into the Liquid we call Water. Add even more heat energy, bringing it to a boil and this begins to break it down into the Gas we know as Steam or Vapor.<br/><br/>The higher the heat energy, the more likely it is to lose valectrons, and thus its bond.<br/><br/>Adding an Atomo&rsquo;s phase to its matching color on the ring, has no effect. However, if you add an Atomo to a color with more Heat Energy it loses -1 Valectron per phase increase. Likewise, you can add +1 Valectron for each phase downward you go as well.<br/><br/>This starts to give you more flexibility in working with the available cards in play.<br/><br/>ELEMAGI MODE<br/>&quot;Radioactivity&quot;<br/><br/>Rules:<br/>&bull; Form an Octet of Valectrons<br/>&bull; Use Phase modifiers.<br/>&bull; Radioactive Atoms must be stabilized.<br/><br/>If you don&rsquo;t see the decaying skull, it&rsquo;s not a radioactive Atomo, and you can ignore this. However, if an Atomo card does have the Decaying Skull on it, this means it is radioactive and must be stabilized in order to use it.<br/><br/>If the summoned Atomo is radioactive, ALL bonds must be made through the plasmagic (yellow) blooms which makes it a stable isotope.<br/><br/>If you fail to create a bond with a radioactive summon on your turn, you must not only discard the Summoned Atomo but also one card from you point deck. <br/><br/>     If you have no cards yet in your point deck, you must discard one from your hand after refilling.<br/><br/><br/>ELEMASTER MODE<br/>&quot;Metal &amp; Bond Types&quot;<br/><br/>Rules:<br/>&bull; Form an Octet of Valectrons<br/>&bull; Use Phase and Radioactive modifiers.<br/>&bull; Use the correct Bond Types (below).<br/><br/>Metal Types:<br/>Each Atomo has one of three Metal Types on it. These determine which cards can bond with the Summoned Atomo, based on the BondBloom you use.<br/><br/>Bond Types:<br/>Each of the BondBlooms is able to perform one of three main Bond Types. You must use the correct pairing of Atomo, or the Bond will not work.<br/><br/>If the bond does work though, it adds or subtracts a set number of Valectrons from the bonding Atomo (no partials):<br/>Ionic:         +/-  1 Valectron<br/>Covalent:      +/-  2 Valectrons<br/>Metallic:      +/-  3 Valectrons<br/><br/>WORLD<br/>EleMasters begins in the world of the Fractal Forest, where science and sorcery collide. Through the Octomic Ring, you can communicate with Atomo', the spirits of Atoms and particles. In learning to wield that ring, you as an EleMage can teach the Atomo' how to alter and bond elements of the periodic table. Train with your fellow EleMagi and then together take this expertise with you to save the world.<br/><br/>-description from designer<br/><br/>",

Players take turns rolling the die, which has 4 colored music notes on it and 2 black notes. When rolled you may play a music card of the specific color from your hand and then take the action written on the card. Some cards allow you to steal a card or give a card away or make everyone shuffle their cards around the circle. In the 21+ version of the game each card also has a drink ability which may allow you to give a drink or even make everyone take a drink. Designed to be played with many people this game can take up to 10 players and is a quick fast paced party game. The game continues and players hand sizes decrease the elusive chair becomes easier to spot but only one person will end the game with it.

        "description": "Monopoly is a roll-and-move game where players move around the game board buying or trading properties, developing their properties with houses and hotels. When opponents land on players owned property, the owning player collects rent from the landing player. Owning sets of properties increases the rent paid to the player who owns them, by the player who lands on the square. The ultimate goal is to have the most money and drive opponents into bankruptcy.<br/><br/>Introduction<br/>Monopoly: The Materials Edition was developed by PhD students from the Advanced Metallic Systems Centre for Doctoral Training. The students developed the game as part of a public engagement project which aims to raise awareness of materials science and engineering and engage people with the world of metallurgy.<br/><br/>From the rear of the box:<br/>The game is played just like traditional Monopoly but instead of purchasing property, players buy different materials as they travel around the board. Materials including metals, ceramics, polymers and composites all feature in the game. Investing in research and development enables you to buy labs and research centres to upgrade your material to a more advanced technology, for example turning steel from paperclips into skyscrapers!<br/>The property cards provide a brief description of the technology.

Gain influence and expand your forces to strategically defeat the opposing faction. You win the battle when you reduce your opponent&rsquo;s health to zero. However, a Battle Commander must be cautious if their opponent is off-initiative. Since Battle for Sularia is a round-based card game, if your opponent is off-initiative, they have the chance to strike back and reduce your health total below theirs and thereby defeating you and winning the game!<br/><br/>FEATURES/GAME PLAY INCLUDES:<br/><br/>Multiple Play Modes<br/>To start play immediately, you can play with the pre-constructed 60 card play deck included in the box. Players can then play in our &quot;60/90&quot; constructed format by customizing their play decks with the additional cards provided in the box! If draft play is more your style, we suggest adding one box of Reign of Terror to our Battle for Sularia core set box, which also supports 2-4 player draft play.<br/><br/>Construction Point Values<br/>Unique &quot;60/90&quot; deck construction system. Each card has a construction point value of 1 to 4 points. Each deck must have a minimum of 60 cards and a deck cannot exceed a total construction value of 90 points. This system pushes the envelope on deck construction and maintains value and interests for all cards within the set &ndash; not just a few select overpowered options.<br/><br/>Two-resource System<br/>Engaging two-resource system which includes influence and sularium. Influence increases once per round, while each player uses their influence to establish sites on their turn to help build their sularium stockpiles. Sularium is used to deploy combatants, which are used to attack your opponent's sites. The two-resource system in turn provides additional strategies for repeatable game play.<br/><br/>Round-based Game<br/>Simultaneous combat! The game runs on a round-based system, which allows each player to complete their turn before the round is over.<br/><br/>Lore and Art<br/>In addition to our engaging game play, we've forged our own path in terms of game setting. This allows us to explore new content and visuals without restrictions, which in turn provides new players with a fresh start and removes the barrier of entry associated with older legacy games and stories.<br/><br/>SETTING:<br/><br/>Reign of Terror: The Protoan introduces a brand new faction to the world of Sularia. The Protoan were originally designed as a biological weapon alternative to the conventional weapons of their time. They were engineered to aggressively spread a viral infection that would pacify an opposing force or civilian population, while leaving the surrounding infrastructures and environment relatively unharmed. Of course, &ldquo;relatively unharmed&rdquo; is a very subjective point of view. Because, if the Protoan could not pacify an enemy with its virus, then they would simply devour them along with anything else in their way.<br/><br/>The breeding facilities of the Protoan were believed to be one of numerous lost technologies of the time before the apocalyptic event know as the Fracture&mdash;nearly a millennium ago. Since the Fracture, they have evolved deep underground&mdash;far beyond their original design. Furthermore, the bio-engineering developed to control their population no longer seems to be effective, as they continue to spread at a rate far beyond their original life expectancy perimeters. As if the power struggle between the Jotune and Synthien wasn&rsquo;t bad enough, this new emerging threat puts the very survival of everyone on the planet at risk.<br/><br/>OVERVIEW:<br/><br/>Reign of Terror: The Protoan is a new stand-alone card game and core faction that is compatible with our other Battle for Sularia card game titles. The Protoan have their own unique game play strategies, as well as familiar options you would expect to find in a competitive card game. See the keywords for a list of new mechanisms.<br/><br/>NEW KEYWORDS:<br/><br/>VIRUS/INFECTION<br/><br/>The VIRUS/INFECTION mechanism is a two-part ability. VIRUS is represented by counters that buff your Protoan combatants in some way. However, when those VIRUS counters are transferred&mdash;through various methods&mdash;to an opponent&rsquo;s combatant, they become known as INFECTION counters. As the name implies, infection is not a good thing for your combatants. If your combatants become seriously infected, they will die.<br/><br/>CHALLENGE<br/><br/>If a Protoan combatant has the CHALLENGE keyword, it can single out an opponent&rsquo;s combatant to defend against it. Whether through intimidation, mind control, or some primal subconscious response of the defender&mdash;it also doesn&rsquo;t matter if the defender is reset or activated&mdash;it has to defend. While this may seem like a good idea by the defender for whatever reason, it usually results in it being completely devoured.<br/><br/>HARDENED<br/><br/>In Reign of Terror, we introduce HARDENED as a keyword that is linked to sites, however it's possible you will see this keyword on combatants in the near future. The ability is pretty solid, pun intended, as it prevents blast-through damage. So if you are familiar with the basic rules, you'll know how useful an ability like this will be in order to stay alive.<br/><br/>Reign of Terror was divided into two parts&mdash;Reign of Terror: The Protoan and Reign of Terror: The Exsularian. They are scheduled to launch in March and May 2018, respectively.<br/><br/>",

Updated rules can be found in the 'Files' section of the BGG page or from the Paradox website (<a target='_blank' href=\"http://www.gamesbypetesanders.com\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer noopener\">www.gamesbypetesanders.com</a>). You will NOT require any new game pieces. !!!<br/><br/>Paradox is a turn based card game in which players act as the offspring of leading timetravel scientist &quot;Doc&quot;. Doc, a genius and slightly extrovert scientist, has spent his career in the pursuit of time travel.  But Doc is becoming old, and needs to hand over his legacy before it is, ironically, lost in time. To select who will be his successor, Doc subjects you to the ultimate test, to return to the past in order to change history so that only one of you is born, sentencing your siblings to be the children that time forgot.<br/><br/>Paradox uses cards to plot the progress of game time and describe the events happening in each day. Player markers are used to track the location of players through the various timelines that may arise throughout the game.  Players can change the events occurring in a day, create new timelines, or destroy timelines all together.<br/><br/>A selection of time travel devices can be found allowing players to go back to the past, fast forward to the future, or move between timelines all together.  Astute players can use combinations of time travel devices and the correct event cards to go for the surprise win.<br/><br/>&mdash;description from the designer<br/><br/>",

Wedge uses the deceptively simple mechanics of bluffing and set creation to regulate this clever game of wedging your card into just the right spot.<br/><br/>The game uses just a deck of cards, a handful of player markers and betting chips to create a linear line from 1-20. Players use cards valued from 1 through 20, dealt at random, to create the line. Placing adjacent to blocks can score you big points but that windfall can also be seen by opponents. Do you go for the obvious points or try to bluff and take your opponent's wagers.<br/><br/>A game of Wedge takes only 20 or so minutes and it is a great ice-breaker to get things kicked off or a nice closer to wind things up.<br/><br/>&mdash;description from the publisher<br/><br/>",

        "description": "Hyperleague Racing is a table-top game inspired by a love of racing style video games like Mario Kart and Crash Team Racing amongst others.<br/><br/>Players become the pilots in highly customisable intergalactic racing leagues where they fly between race markers while swinging round moons, asteroids, black holes and other space themed terrain while performing a range of tricks and manoeuvres to get ahead or better still, crash their rivals in to space junk!<br/><br/>In the standard game, players either play as individual racers of their own design or use one of the pre-generated All-Star racers in &lsquo;all against all&rsquo; 2-4 player action. Options exist to also play as a pair of racers racing against other pairs, demolition derby and a fun version affectionately called Puzzle Racer Turbo.<br/><br/>In Championship Mode however, the player takes the role of a fresh faced racer from one of the factions and as the campaign progresses, the pilot gains Championship Points to spend on upgrading their pilot, ship or garage.<br/><br/>Each turn, players activate their racer and make a simple race action followed by up to 3 manoeuvres and then a trick. A typical player turn takes minutes and every action is a balance of risk vs. reward. This creates a straight forward but fast paced balanced game that suits gamers that like a game that can be played quickly as a fun 30 minute blast or by players that want a more tactical game.<br/><br/>",

With over 26 Engines and 60 parts there are lots of combinations to try out.<br/><br/>The second part of the game is the race itself. Once the pilots have completed building they will take off. The race is driven by players rolling 2 types of dice, engine dice which are numbered 1-6 to determine a ships speed and the pilot die which corresponds to one of the 6 pilot colors giving the rolled pilots ship a bonus.<br/><br/>High tensions will rise in this head to head all out race to the finish line.

        "description": "Price of Honor details the battle of Callao fought on May 2nd, 1866. The South American countries of Peru, Bolivia and Chile united in defying the Spanish government access to the nitrate rich Chincha Islands, and over other trade issues. Anti-Spanish riots and atrocities against Spanish citizens in these nations led to Spain ordering a powerful squadron of warships, led by the ironclad battleship Numancia, to seize the Chincha Islands and blockade their coasts. This was a flagrant violation of the Monroe Doctine, and the US and British governments also sent squadrons of warships to the area to monitor the situation, and possibly intervene against the Spanish fleet.<br/><br/>After taking the islands and announcing a blockade the Spanish Admiral Casto Mendez Nu&ntilde;ez announced that unless reparations were paid and apologies given by the South American Allied nations to Spain, the Spanish ships would begin attacking their shipping and ports. This threat was made reality on March 31st when the Spanish warships bombarded Valparaiso, Chile. The port was largely defenseless and unable to effectively resist. Emboldened, the Spanish fleet moved onto Callao where the bulk of the Allied warships and commercial shipping had concentrated. The port defenses here were more substantial and armed with modern guns, including five massive 22 ton Blakely guns in armored turrets, as well as bolstered by two ironclads, the Loa and Victoria. Learning that two new Peruvian ironclads, the Huascar and Independencia, were also about to arrive, Admiral Nu&ntilde;ez ordered an attack on May 2nd, despite the looming presence of the American and British warships whose leaders threatened to intervene.<br/><br/>The Spanish fleet&rsquo;s attack at Callao was violent and damaging. Nearly 6,000 shells were fired by the Spanish ships alone, causing many casualties and much damage to the port&rsquo;s defensive works and Allied warships. The Spanish fleet, however, also suffered with several of their warships severely damaged, crippled, or nearly sinking by the end of the afternoon when Admiral Nu&ntilde;ez ordered the Spanish fleet to break off and retire. Although inconclusive both sides claimed victory. Can you do as well or better than your historical counterpart?<br/><br/>Each copy of The Price of Honor is composed of the following:<br/><br/>One 11 by 17 inch hex map<br/>Two sheets of 242 (total) single-sided, unmounted counters<br/>One Players' Aid Sheet<br/>Seven pages of rules<br/><br/>Price of Honor is designed by Paul Rohrbaugh with graphics by Bruce Yearian.

        "description": "Dragon Stories is a story telling euro style game that utilizes modified worker placement and area control set in the fantasy world of the Arcturian nations.  The mighty Dragon Weyr has withdrawn their protection from the peoples of the land due to corruption and mistrust between the various races.  The leaders of the nations no longer believe that an outside threat exists which could harm their realm and have begun to manipulate the dragons into attacking their new found local enemies.  The Dragon Weyr viewed these actions as a violation of the ancient code set forth at the beginning of time and have thusly withdrawn their support from the land.  However, not all people are corrupt in the land.  The sacred religious council set up by Arcturias himself still holds hope that the hearts of the corrupted can be turned virtuous again in time.  The council has therefore laid the burden of traveling throughout the land to sway the ancient protectors, upon you.  If you accomplish the task of reinstating the ancient code, the evil that lurks in the shadows will be too weak to overthrow the local kingdoms.  <br/>In Dragon Stories, 1-6 players will manage stats on their individual player boards similar to an engine building game.  The stats on the board also act as currency in the game.  Stat labels are ranged / melee weapons, defensive armor, magical talents and various skills depending on the player board making Dragon Stories uniquely asymmetrical.  Players will interact with the game itself through stories written on cards.  Tough decisions will have to be made to convince the ancient dragons to help protect the realm.  Players will manipulate a modified worker placement system.  Player board stats will have the ability to be improved and players will have to defend the land from invading forces and possibly other players.  Ultimately though, if players do not figure out how to work together, the impending evil will take over the land.  Additionally, the invading evil is also seeking to persuade the dragons to destroy the people of the land.  Enemy forces will accomplish this through a game driven worker placement mechanic which ultimately ends up limiting players worker placement choices as the game progresses.  The only way to stop the enemy is through area control and persuading the dragons to honor the old code.  <br/>Dragon Stories also features different ways to play to suit differing play styles.  Players can play full coop mode which is an all win or all lose style game.  Players can also choose to either play semi cooperatively or strictly competitively.  In the end, you will tell your own Dragon Stories.<br/><br/>",

        "description": "Suckerfish Investing Game is a fun and educational tabletop game that teaches players the important life principles of value investing!<br/><br/>The theme of this game is to not only survive but thrive within the deep sea of investing! This game is named after the smart and cunning &ldquo;suckerfish&rdquo; (aka a Remora) that swims alongside sharks and whales in the deep ocean. These fish are not scared of the sharks and the sharks are not bothered by the fish.<br/><br/>They thrive together. The sharks catch big fish and the Remora eat up all the scraps! Then the Remora suction-cup their heads to the sharks (which remove any barnacles from the shark) in order to catch a free ride on the shark as it swims through the vast ocean.<br/><br/>These suckerfish have a pretty good deal!<br/><br/>In Suckerfish Investing players will follow alongside a whale and a shark as they rise and fall (in price) throughout the deep sea of investing! Players will learn the mental side of investing, such as buying low, selling high and collecting dividends. Likewise, players will learn the emotional side of investing, such as not freaking out, being patient and investing for the long term.<br/><br/>In this game, players will start with $5,000 each and then receive an additional $2,000 contribution every couple of months. Each player will receive the same amount throughout the game, and it is their job to invest it wisely to WIN!<br/><br/>This game consists of a deck of 44 playing cards, 8 player cards, and 2 company cards. Each company card has 26 tiles that represent units of stock, and each company has an electronic tally counter (2 total) that keep track of the price of each company as it moves. Each card (labeled NEXT MONTH) represents 1 month of time and the entire deck represents an investing journey of over 3 years!<br/><br/>Once the game is setup and all players are ready, the game begins and players may buy Fast Growth or Blue Chip in increments of 100 shares. Players do not have &ldquo;turns&rdquo; in this game, rather, they can buy and or sell at any time and must help each other to double-check the math and accounting.<br/><br/>When all players are ready, one player can flip the NEXT MONTH card on the top of the deck and follow its instructions to either:<br/>Update the numbers on the electronic tally counters by pressing the red or green buttons<br/>Distribute contributions to the player whose color matches the color on the card<br/>Pay dividends to all players who own the dividend paying company<br/>All players pay taxes when these cards arise<br/><br/>Throughout this game, players have to keep track of two moving stock prices while deciding whether to buy, sell, hold or wait, and this game is an emotional rollercoaster ride of investing!<br/><br/>Players will continue this throughout the entire deck of cards. When the last card is played, the player with the highest score WINS!  (Fast Growth + Blue Chip + Cash = Total Score)<br/><br/>This game teaches players:<br/>1. Multiplication, addition, and subtraction<br/>2. Accounting of money and stock units<br/>3. Investing principle - buy low and sell high<br/>4. Investing principle - collect and reinvest dividends <br/>5. Emotional intelligence - don&rsquo;t let your emotions lead you to bad investing such as buying when the price goes up and then watching it go down, rather than watching it go down and then buying! <br/>6. Advanced strategy - keeping track of the spread and standard deviation between the two companies to take advantage (buy and sell) of opportunities in price swing  <br/>7. Advanced strategy - recognizing the patterns and building an investment strategy to take advantage of these growth and dividend payments patterns<br/><br/>About the Two Companies:<br/><br/>Fast Growth - a fast-growing company whose price is up and down and all over the place. You can make a lot of money with Fast Growth if you buy it at the right time. Buy low and sell high!  *Fast Growth does not pay dividends.<br/><br/>Blue Chip ETF - a whole bunch of individual companies rolled into one &ldquo;exchange-traded fund&rdquo; or ETF. This stock will grow a bit slower than Fast Growth, but it pays big dividends!<br/><br/>Each player may buy or sell either Fast Growth or Blue Chip in increments of 100 with a limit of 500 per month. The player with the highest score at the end of the card deck is the WINNER!<br/><br/>&ldquo;I created this game because I truly wish I had this game when growing up. I didn&rsquo;t learn about this basic investing stuff until my 30&rsquo;s and I definitely wasn&rsquo;t able to cram 3 years of investing experience into 30 minutes! I believe this game can help educate and inspire a generation to become financially free!&rdquo;<br/><br/>Josh Vojtisek<br/>Game creator<br/><br/>",

        "description": "Titanomachina is crunchy giant robot action! Players bring customized strategies (Titans composed of systems, weapons, and crews; and buildings) to battle their opponents for local supremacy. Position and timing are crucial, as weapons charge, initiative changes hands, and the cease-fire deadline inches closer.<br/><br/>Before the first round players draw cards for initiative, and can either set up by using a system of points, or by drafting their Titan's systems, weapons and crew out of the available cards. After set-up, the players add the weapon and crew cards to their decks of systems. Players can order these decks to their liking. Finally, players place their buildings and then their Titans on the board.<br/><br/>During a round players take turns in order of highest initiative score to lowest. Each turn a player can either play cards from their hand; they can play ('activate') one card face-up as an action, and others face-down to charge it, or pass. Actions include moving, attacking, blocking attacks, generating shields, repairing the Titan, increasing a Titan's initiative score (and changing its player's position in the turn order), and using crew to operate weapons for bonuses. Players keep taking turns until they run out of cards or they all pass. When the round is over all played cards are discarded to the bottom of their Titan decks, and players draw more cards from the top of those decks.<br/><br/>The game lasts 18 rounds, or until one player achieves a 10-point lead on their respective scores. Buildings determine the player's starting score. Players then score additional Victory Points by destroying parts of enemy Titans, and preserving their own Titan until the end of the game. Players need to manage all the parts of their titanic machines to turn them into smoothly running engines of victory.<br/><br/>-description from designer<br/><br/>",

It is similar to King's Cup but IT ISN'T King's Cup (we cannot stress this enough).<br/><br/>The game works like this: players take turns picking cards and responding to the actions on the cards, you could pick cards like Licktator, Royal Interrogator, Queen of Hearts, Secrets and many more. The objective of the game is to play your friends, making them share as much as humanly possible about their deepest darkest secrets. Players continue picking cards and fulfilling its actions until either the chain of cards is broken--which results in that player being kicked out of the game--or a Licktator takes a player out, immediately ending their Licktatorship. The last player remaining in the game, wins.<br/><br/>The game is a lot of fun, has a lot of elements from traditional games such as spin the bottle, never have I ever, truth or dare and other games, and it has a lot of hilarious rules such as No Cursing, Hodor!, CPR, Eunuch, Premature Pants/Long Live the King and many more.<br/><br/>The game is available in four languages (English, German, Spanish and Persian).<br/><br/>&mdash;description from the designer<br/><br/>",

Your aim is to end the game with the most sheltered guinea pigs, hence becoming the most prosperous tribe.<br/><br/>To build shelters, players require resources. At the start of each round a number of resources are played to the centre of the table. Players mark the ones they wish to claim using their 3 action tokens and subsequently compete over them using their guinea pigs. The strongest guinea pig takes the spoils whilst the others are sent to the graveyard.<br/><br/>Resources such as wood, rope, cloth and stone can be traded in to construct buildings.<br/><br/>Each type of building allows the player to provide shelter for a number of their guinea pigs. Additionally, hospitals allow you to revive those injured in battle, prisons can be used to capture enemy guinea pigs, mines generate free resources each round and temples award powerful miracle cards.<br/><br/>At the end of each round players will see a number of their homeless guinea pigs succumb to a terrible catastrophe such as a comet strike, or being eaten by a fat cat - only those safely sheltered inside a building are safe. Eventually when there are no more homeless guinea pigs the game is over and only the player with the most sheltered floof will be declared the winner.<br/><br/>&mdash;description from the publisher<br/><br/>",

The game contains 4 different habitats (arctic, jungle, savannah, and pasture); each habitat has 4 different animals available.<br/><br/>The game begins with two shuffled decks of cards - &quot;Place&quot; cards and &quot;Face&quot; cards.  These are placed where all players can reach them.  The player who has had the most exotic pet goes first.  On his/her turn, each player can select a maximum of 2 of the following actions:  (1) take a card from either deck; (2) put a card down; (3) trade a card with another player; (4) discard a card; or (5) pass.  Players' hands may not exceed 7 cards.<br/><br/>Players get points for the matched pairs they place down on the animals' correct habitats.  First player to 10 points wins.<br/><br/>&mdash;description from the designer<br/><br/>",

Each player holds five hand cards and tries to form effective combos which enable them to shoot at the opponents goal. The opponent can use block or counterattack cards, but since hands are refilled at the beginning of a turn, one can try to attack when the opponent is low on cards to maximize one's chances. Some special cards simulate fan support and specially gifted players. <br/>There is a game end card somewhere in the bottom half of the draw pile. When that appears, each player has another two turns before the final whistle sounds. Whoever scored more goals, wins.<br/><br/>In the solitaire mode, the player plays their way through a world cup with group and knock out stages.

There are a million promises you need to keep that you made on the campaign trail, but there's one that echoes through those who've supported you: build the wall. The only problem is there are those who want to do it before you and take all your glory. But you can't let that happen, you're the greatest! Nobody is better than you.<br/> Executive Order is a game of quickness and trolling as you fight to complete your wall before your competitors. But will you go straight for the glory and complete your wall? Or will you instead make it as difficult as possible for your competitors to complete theirs?<br/><br/>Use cards to create strategic moves and shuffle things around. Don&rsquo;t like your current hand? Play &ldquo;Alternative Facts&rdquo; and draw a new one. Somebody put down a Wall card before you? Play &ldquo;Congress&rdquo; to have it taken away.<br/><br/>Ideal for 2-7  players 13 and over. Gameplay averages 30 minutes or more.<br/><br/>In Executive Order, the goal for players is to be the first to have three active Wall cards in front of them on the table. Players take turns by playing a card from their hand, resolving its action, and then drawing back up to their hand size. Some cards that can be played include &quot;Wall&quot; cards, &quot;Budget Cuts&quot; (reduces a players hand size by one card), &quot;Congress&quot; (removes an active wall card from in front of a player), &quot;Deport&quot;  (cancels a players card and returns it to their hand), or &quot;Umm, No!&quot; (cancels a players turn). Players can even debate on the table by creating a stack of &quot;Deports&quot; and &quot;Ummm, Nos&quot; until someone claims victory!<br/><br/>Players can also add  new rules by playing the &quot;Executive Order&quot; card. But be careful, a &quot;Court Ruling&quot; card can put your rule to a vote to see if it remains or a player can play &quot;AltTwit@ExeOrder&quot; to exempt themselves from the rule!<br/><br/>",

In an unusual twist, you also face off against a fledgling, rapidly-evolving AI who also seeks to command the Grid - the very parts that make up its being.<br/><br/>To take on The Grid, you&rsquo;ll research 12 critical technologies like robotics and cognitive science, protect them from AI attack with firewalls, manipulate The Grid to claim a strategic advantage, or reclaim a pillar overrun by the awakening artificial force.<br/><br/>In your mission to harness AI, you&rsquo;ll use Development cards to give you research-enabling brain power or influence. But your fate is not entirely in your hands; progress will continually be shaped by Contingencies that reveal unexpected traits within yourself, deliver useful power-ups to accelerate research or introduce game-changing events - such as AI Attack - that can instantly change the balance of power.<br/><br/>The path to AI supremacy is clear. Collect tech and victory tokens as you research technology pillars, or overtake them from opposing forces. Complete critical secret missions that strengthen your claim of AI control. Once the Grid is fully developed, the scientist with the most points has won, unlocking the infinite potential of AI for all of humanity.<br/><br/>But be careful not to focus too much on the scientific rivalry. The juvenile AI also seeks control of The Grid. When the time comes, put aside differences and work together to repel it&hellip; or risk giving this artificial force the power to escape into the world and confront mankind with an uncertain future.<br/><br/>When you set out to master The Grid, you do so with numerous decks of exquisite cards and tokens that have been carefully crafted to immerse you in a futuristic frontier of self-aware intelligence.<br/><br/>Fight to harness the phenomenal power of The Grid.

Each player then draws 3 cards from his deck and places his remaining cards aside. The person to win the first turn of the first round chooses an opponent from among the remaining players. To attack, he lays down one of his three chosen cards. The chosen opponent also lays down one of his three chosen cards.(Right before each player lays down his attacking card,it is best to snap the attacking card out of one&rsquo;s own hand in a showy and extravagant manner. This is done to intimidate the other player. It is also quite enjoyable.)To determine the winner of the attack, each player must roll a die, combine that number with the value of his card, and whomever has the highest overall score wins the battle. Each number card is worth its face value (the Ace is worth 1 point, the 2 is worth 2 points, etc,), and each face card is worth 10 points. However, when attacking with a Jack, the Jack gains one offensive point becoming worth 11 points, and when defending with a Queen, the Queen gains 1 defensive point becoming worth 11 points. If a tie takes place, the defender wins the round. Play continues in clock-wise fashion with each player attacking only once each round. If a player has no cards when it is his turn to attack, then he is out for the remainder of the round.<br/><br/>Each successive round is begun by the person clock-wise from the person to attack first in the previous round.<br/><br/>The winner of the game is determined by the player with the last King left alive. If a player loses a King during game play, he may continue playing but cannot win the game.<br/><br/>Suit powers<br/><br/>Hearts: Healers. At the end of each turn roll 1 die for any one card that fought during that turn. If the roll is odd, healing failed and proceed to next card or end turn. If even, roll die and regain health up to number rolled or max health (whichever comes first)<br/><br/>Spades: Necromancers. At the end of each turn, if any cards 1-6 &ldquo;died&quot; during that turn or in a previous turn they are eligible to be revived. Roll a die and revive any eligible card covered by the die. Example: If a 1 is rolled then an the ace (if eligible) can be revived. If a 5 is rolled, any card 1-5 that is eligible can be revived.<br/><br/>Diamonds: +Defense every card. +1 health and 50/50 chance to &ldquo;block&rdquo; an attack by rolling die when attacked. If even, a &quot;block&quot; happens and negates an additional damage point.<br/><br/>Clubs: +Offense every card. +1 to attack roll and 50/50 chance to do &ldquo;double damage&rdquo; on an attack by rolling die when attacking.

        "description": "User summary<br/>鳥獣漫画 (Tyouju-Manga), is a Japanese card game, a quick 'communications' game using cards. The artwork on the cards is taken from classic Japanese painting. Animals are shown as if human, and they play out folklore tales, frogs, rabbits, birds, and foxes. This gives the game a light, surreal feeling.<br/><br/>In this game, all players try to make a manga. Players start with a certain number of cards in hand. These cards act as a single frame with an empty dialogue balloon. In clockwise order, the active player plays a card and all players discuss about what quote should be included in the dialogue balloon. A new card played acts as a continuing frame from the previous cards so all players will attempt to make a totally original manga with an original story.<br/><br/>Publisher's summary<br/>このゲームは、みんなでマンガを作ります。プレイヤーはカードを何枚か持ちますが、これがマンガの「コマ」になっています。「コマ」の吹き出しにはセリフが書いていません。プレイヤーは時計回りにカードをテーブルの上に出します。カードを出すたびに吹き出しのセリフをみんなで議論して決めます。先に出したカードの物語を後に出したカードが引き継いでいき、オリジナルなストーリーを作りましょう。<br/><br/>",

        "description": "Absolutism is a party card game that presents players with unfathomable scenarios of daily life in a totalitarian society to which they have to offer solutions. But as no sane solutions can save you in a real dictatorship, in Absolutism.<br/><br/>The game offers a funny satirical take on dictatorship from a team of three who spent their childhood and adolescence in&hellip; communism.<br/><br/>We strongly believe that humor is healing. Some people who lived in Dictatorships still have a good amount of healing left to do. And some other people who just now make contact with some sort of pre-dictatorship reality will definitely need this humorous approach to survive and overcome it. We hope to provide some of that humor to them with the ABSOLUTISM game.<br/><br/>With a unique blend of descriptive language and political themes, Absolutism gives a deep understanding of a totalitarian way-of-life while having crazy fun.<br/><br/>&mdash;description from the publisher<br/><br/>",

        "description": "The Drawing Game is a new, fast-paced group boardgame. Your goal is to frantically draw your way to the bottom the Wordsmith&rsquo;s wordlist faster than the other team to win each round, best of multiple rounds wins the game.<br/><br/>Split into two teams (more possible, but two is best) and one &lsquo;Wordsmith&rsquo; and position each team in a different room in the house (living room and kitchen, say). The teams can be almost any size, so long as you can see the piece of paper being drawn on. The Wordsmith sits at an equal distance to the two teams (on the stairs, for example) with the Wordlist. At the beginning of the game, one member of each team comes to the Wordsmith, and 3, 2, 1... the Wordsmith whispers the first word on the list to the two team members.<br/><br/>The two team members sprint back to their teams&rsquo; as fast as they can, word in mind, pencil in hand, they start manically drawing the word on a piece of paper and whoever is first to guess the word correctly then, themselves, sprints to the Wordsmith to whisper the just-guessed word to them, hear the next word on the list, and sprint back themselves.<br/><br/>It is a speed drawing battle, and sprinting battle between the two teams to see which can get through the Wordsmith&rsquo;s list of 20 words fastest. When one team wins, the Wordsmith shouts the winning team name. The game then continues for as many rounds as you wish to play - warning, it&rsquo;s highly addictive so be careful.<br/><br/>The Wordsmith&rsquo;s job is far from mundane and simple word whispering. They are a key element in the overall absurdity of the game. They are the only player that knows (kind of) what&rsquo;s going on at any one time. The teams will be so engrossed in what they&rsquo;re drawing and guessing at speed that it is the job of the Wordsmith to keep the teams in the know on who is in the lead, by how many, how many more words there are to the end of the round. They are also the main judge of cheating, they must keep a keen ear on proceedings for any whispering of words to teammates. If two teams come running out of their respective rooms at the same time, it is the Wordsmith who decides who really was in front. Some useful phrases to have in the back of your mind, imagine we have Team Fantastics and Team Golden Oldies:<br/><br/>&ldquo;Fantastics and the Golden Oldies are neck and neck!&rdquo;<br/>&ldquo;Oooh, I&rsquo;m sorry to say Golden Oldies you&rsquo;re three behind the Fantastics at this moment.&rdquo;<br/>&ldquo;Golden Oldies have made a comeback and have just overtaken Fantastics!&rdquo;<br/>&ldquo;Oh dear, what&rsquo;s going on with Fantastics, you&rsquo;ve been stuck on this one for a while now.&rdquo;<br/>&ldquo;And there&rsquo;s only three to go to the end of the game, come on Team Fantastic, you can claw this back!&rdquo;<br/>&ldquo;Last word now, seconds to go in this round.&rdquo;<br/><br/>&mdash;description from the designer<br/><br/>",

To triumph the team must balance: using actions to attack the hoards (which earns them gold), with investing in building defensive towers (which takes several actions, but provides additional attacks each round).<br/><br/>Defenders of Dragonfell is an Action Point based game. Heroes can either, move, shoot or build to make their way across the map and start killing off the attacking wave of monsters. Killing monsters earns the hero gold, which they use to buy one of the unique tower types.

        "description": "Hitler&rsquo;s fascination of New York City in flames drove Germany&rsquo;s leading aircraft engineers to begin development of several options for bombers that could strike targets on American soil from European air bases. In 1942, the Amerika Bomber Project was born which produced several contenders vying for the chance to make Hitler&rsquo;s dream come true. In Amerika, not only was the project very successful, but by 1946 heavily funded to aid in the air supremacy war over the Atlantic. The Horten XVIII B-2 (from the base game) became the best all-around platform of the project, and was the mainstay of Nazi bomber supremacy. The Arado E-555 and Messerschmitt Me-264 (from the expansion Bring In The Heavies) were both very competent designs as well, helping to soften defenses and destroy Allied installations.<br/>But several other designs from the project were also produced in limited numbers to round out the air force and provide mission flexibility. When the decision was made to invade North America, every resource available had to be called upon for a chance at success to even be possible. Help turn the tide of war in Germany&rsquo;s favor using these Amerika Bomber Project aircraft in AMERIKA!<br/><br/>-description from publisher<br/><br/>",

Players can choose to focus on their Heroes or begin to diversify their armies by upgrading buildings unlocking more strategic pieces, such as Archers or Calvary.<br/><br/>You may advance out capturing areas of the board that translates into coin and gives you a spell card or keep your hero in place and quest for epic gear and more.<br/><br/>There are many goals to win the game. If you are able to get both swords of power into your capital, bring 4 breeds to your capital or go for complete annihilation by taking out both of your enemy&rsquo;s main capitals to win.

A sequel to the popular ROME, Inc. you again will be running the Roman Empire like a business, but this time the barbarians are well and truly at the gates. Together the players operate behind the scenes, promoting and removing emperors, governors, and the occasional pope.<br/><br/>When corporate axeman Diocletian terminated his predecessor in the finest traditions of ROME, Inc., no one expected a complete rebranding operation. Realizing that something new was needed to revive the flagging fortunes of a corporate dinosaur he made his friend Maximinus co-CEO in a new east-west operation, ROME, IInc. Players can accept the challenge solo, or share control of the empire with a partner, one in the East, and the other in the West.<br/><br/>Together or alone, you control the mechanics of a failing empire, choosing five distinct &ldquo;starting points&rdquo; (286 CE, 363 CE, 425 CE, 497 CE and 565 CE) and run scenarios lasting 10-50 turns, depending on your corporate acumen and endurance. Each turn represents 5-10 years, with 10 turns in each of the five scenarios. If you already own ROME, Inc. you can extend the game into ROME, IInc. for a truly epic 90 turn game charting the rise and fall of history&rsquo;s greatest empire.<br/><br/>Historical statesmen are not only rated for their abilities as a commander, administrator, and intriguer, but their devotion to the Christian Orthodoxy, and each has a special ability to give him an edge. Every turn sees crises and challenges that the players must deal with, to expand, or sometimes simply to survive.<br/><br/>The map consists of provinces grouped into the four great commands of Gaul, Italy, Illyria, and the Orient, each commanded by a governor. Provinces may be given to foederati barbarian allies to guard the frontier or plagued by heretics. Beyond these is the dreaded Attila the Hun, driving lesser barbarians from their homelands, and pillaging his way from province to province until defeated.<br/><br/>You decide where to allocate resources (capital spending), raise new forces (hiring), undertake prestige projects (public relations), pleasing the church (shareholders), or even setting aside a reserve for a rainy decade or two. You need to blend military acumen with careful administration, as well as intrigue, making the most of what you have each turn, just like any modern-day business. ROME, IInc. will give you a new perception of how war is a cost, business is a benefit, and empire is somewhere in between.

The reader then reveals the answer cards, and everyone who guessed correctly gets a point.<br/><br/>The key is that players answer anonymously, so they can be truthful about topics that are usually unspoken or taboo.<br/><br/>First designed in 1993, Naked Truth creates funny, powerful and eye-popping moments when you discover how many pee in the shower, cheated on a lover or kissed someone before they knew their name.<br/><br/>",

        "description": "Neolithic: Warfare Before the Beginning of Time is a very simple wargame designed for small numbers (six to ten per side) of opposing units using non-metallic and simple weapons and armors.  Units are either various types of humans or animals.  Each unit typically has some specific single quality (e.g., a Spearman has a very high morale level, etc.).  The game is limited to two opposing forces; players alternate taking turns.  Checks in the game (morale, hit, etc.) are made using one or two ten-sided dice.<br/><br/>Units represent single combatants.  Morale checks are made for each unit under several circumstances; failed checks lead first to degraded morale, then to rout.  Movement is given in inches, and units may walk, run, or charge.  Rout (flee) movement is given in random inches.  During a turn, missile fire precedes m&ecirc;l&eacute;e and effects take place immediately (this gives considerable advantage to the player that moves first in the game).  Units sustaining damage can be killed or captured.<br/><br/>The game does not use scale and any &quot;small&quot; figures (generally, miniatures or tokens) may be used.<br/><br/>A player loses when all of their units are killed, captured, or routed.  Alternately, the players can agree upon victory conditions prior to the game (typically capturing specific units or routing a certain number of units to represent area control).<br/><br/>The game was provided as a downloadable PDF document, and at one time also was hosted online in HTML format.<br/><br/>&mdash;User Summary<br/><br/>",

        "description": "Before there was Empire, there was a ...Partnership? Yes, it was a world of clients and patrons where the words &quot;The Senate and People of Rome&quot; were not the hollow phrase it became under the Empire. For Senators, engaging in business was taboo, but money-making (even from graft) was not, and citizens of the growing Republic shared in their patrons&rsquo; wealth and prestige. But it was at best, a limited liability partnership, an unsuccessful general might merely be banished and replaced by another, but an unsuccessful legion might be....decimated.<br/><br/>ROME, LLP. is a solitaire game of the Roman Republic by Philip Jelley, as it grows from a small city state in 400 BCE to an empire in 27 BCE, when Octavian took the imperial name of Augustus. A prequel to the popular ROME, INC. (ATO 53) and ROME, IInc. (ATO 61) you will again be running a business, but this time the &ldquo;Republic of Rome&rdquo; is starting from scratch with minimal resources and highly competitive rivals, Brennus the Gaul, Hannibal Barca, Mithridates the Great, Spartacus, and Queen Cleopatra. The player operates behind the scenes, promoting and removing consuls, censors, governors, and tribunes (and dictators in a real emergency) as Roman legions monopolize the Mediterranean.<br/><br/>The pair of consuls rule Italia, allowing the player to choose which of the co-CEOs are best for the job in hand (unless they start arguing, which could be disastrous), with a censor to maintain public morals, and an obstructive tribune representing the workforce, vetoing senatorial appointments, and changing the game by proposing new laws. Provinces grouped into Italia and the eight proconsular commands of Aegyptus, Africa, Gallia Cisalpina, Gallia Transalpina, Hispania, Macedonia, Pontica, and Syria, each controlled by a Governor, who collects taxes, quells insurgents, and fights wars, but may March on Rome and make himself Dictator For Life.<br/><br/>Patrician and plebeian Statesmen are rated for their military, administration, popularity, and intrigue abilities, and gifted with a special ability. For example, Marcus Antonius has 4 Military, 1 Administration, 5 Popularity, and 4 Intrigue, making him a good general, appallingly corrupt administrator, exceptionally popular, and more than happy to remove his political rivals with a stab in the back, while his Leader special ability encourages him to rebel and might even make him an Aegyptian Leader like Cleopatra. Legions, auxilia, colonies, and fleets are used to fight wars and garrison provinces. Loyal allies protect the frontier as natives are civilized until they are ripe for annexation. Enemy leaders and barbarian wars pillage their way from province to province until defeated, encouraging revolts, and reclaiming territory. Fighting a war may mean a glorious triumph, ghastly disaster, or bloody stalemate, perhaps Fabius had the right idea.<br/><br/>Victory is determined by winning Prestige, earned by prudent administration, annexing provinces, winning wars, and plying the people with bread and circuses. If the barbarians take Rome, the Republic will fall and the game ends in in defeat, but bankruptcy and popular revolution will have the same effect. You alone control the mechanics of a rising republic, choosing four distinct &ldquo;starting points&rdquo; (400 BCE, 267 BCE, 149 BCE, and 82 BCE) and running scenarios lasting 10-40 turns (if you get that far), depending on your business acumen and endurance. Each turn represents 5-15 years, with 10 turns in each of the four scenarios. You can extend the game into ROME, INC. and ROME, IInc. for a truly epic game charting the rise and fall of history&rsquo;s greatest empire.<br/><br/>You decide where to allocate resources (capital spending), raise new forces (hiring), undertake prestige projects (public relations), pleasing the Senate (shareholders) and the People (workforce), or even setting aside a reserve for a rainy decade or two. You need to blend military acumen with careful administration, as well as intrigue, making the most of what you have each turn, just like any modern-day business. ROME, LLP. will give you a new perception of how war is a cost, business is a benefit, and empire is somewhere in between. It&rsquo;s up to you to find a balance. ROME, LLP. comes with one full color 22&quot; x 34&quot; mapsheet, 280 full color 1/2&quot; die-cut pieces and around 12 pages of rules. Players should average from 2 to 4 hours per scenario<br/><br/>&mdash;description from the Against the Odds Pipeline Page <br/><br/>",

Skill players and teams will perform according to their statistical abilities. Each team has its own Team Chart which includes individual ratings for all skill players. Defense and the Offensive Line are based on team effort, but are affected by injuries.<br/><br/>A big factor in the game is Influence. Teams are rated for run and pass Influence, which is affected throughout the game. A team gaining Influence (and both teams can on a play), increases their chance of affecting the play. There is a quick bout of suspense / anticipation as every play quickly develops to the final result.<br/> The game plays using a combination of Dice, Game Action Cards, and Results Cards (random numbers are on the Results Cards for those who don&rsquo;t want to use dice). There are no separate charts for looking up results, it's all right there on either the Team Charts or the Cards.<br/><br/>You choose if you want to coach either or both Offenses and or Defenses or let the Solitaire Charts call all the Plays, or you can use the Quick Play Rules where you only have to worry about the Offenses, or you can also let the Solitaire Charts make the decisions. A standard game takes approximately two hours to play, while the quick play option reduces time by forty minutes. The quick play rules use the same charts as the standard game making it easy to move between the two in case of a blowout.<br/><br/>A spreadsheet (Excel or Numbers) is included so you can create and print your own Team Chart. This allows you to recreate past season, or play along with any current season.<br/><br/>As in any real football game, weather plays a role. Quick reference cards are used for wind, rain, snow, or combinations of each.<br/><br/>&mdash;description from the publisher<br/><br/>",

Hitler, Stalin, Mussolini, Saddam and Kim, joined by Putin, Trump, THE HONEY BADGER and others face one another in a final showdown. However, Mother Nature realizes that such a huge war will be the end of our planet, so she sends to the rescue THE RAINBOW VOMITING UNICORNS. According to an old prophesy, if a rainbow touches you, your gender changes. Thus, the evil dictators turn into nice old ladies, who instead of waging war, gift each other worm knit socks and go pony riding together.<br/><br/>Dictators vs. Unicorns is a fighting card game in which you take control of up to 3 character cards, that have an evil dictator on one side, and a nice old lady on the other. Your goal is to destroy your opponents&rsquo; characters before they destroy yours.<br/><br/>To deal damage to your opponents&rsquo; characters, you throw different action cards at them. There are 2 types of action cards &ndash; evil cards, that can be played only by the dictators and good cards, that can be played only by the old ladies. They all deal different amounts of damage:<br/>Evil cards deal normal damage to dictators and severe damage to the helpless old ladies.<br/>Good cards deal high damage to the dictators, because they hurt their ego and heal the other old ladies, instead of hurting them.<br/><br/>All dictators and old ladies have unique special skills they can use, by sacrificing health points. You can use the unicorn cards to turn your or your opponents&rsquo; dictators into old ladies or vice versa. You do that in order to use a specific skill, play a good or an evil action card, or deal a specific damage to a specific character. <br/>During your turn, you can do any of the following actions: <br/>Use a dictator to play an evil action card from your hand and deal damage to other dictators or old ladies. <br/>Use an old lady to play a good action card from your hand and either deal damage to other dictators or heal an old lady.<br/>Use any of your character's special skills.<br/><br/>You can use the unicorn cards in your hand at any single moment of the game &ndash; during your turn or during your opponent&rsquo;s turn &ndash; in order to affect the gameplay in endless unexpected ways.<br/><br/>Will you be Saddam, or Miss Husain? Will you send Nazi zombies to eat your opponent&rsquo;s brains or defeat them by giving them cute puppy presents which will destroy their evil dignity Witness a Third World War like no other, fought with poo mines and cotton candy, and rainbow vomit all over the place.<br/><br/>",

The deck can be used as normal playing cards from 2 to ace + jokers. But also as a Japanese Hanafuda deck (48 cards + 6 jokers). The cards can be used playing Trumps, Dingo, Old Maid and other games also.<br/><br/>You can also battle with the characters. Pick five random cards each and do not show your opponent. The rest of the cards is placed in a &ldquo;dice pile&rdquo;. The player who most recently was in a fight (for real!) start. It might be back in preschool? Pick one of your characters and decide if you want to do a physical attack; the sword or a mental attack; the candle. Sword attacks are obviously defended by the shield and candle attacks are defended by the smiley face; humour.<br/><br/>The opponent picks out a character he thinks can defend without knowing the attacking value. Now both player draws a card from the dice pile and add the eyes on the card's die to their value, starting with the attacker. Highest total wins and is placed in front of the winner as a used character that won the battle. Also place the die card under it, it's the price for winning; a new recruit. The defeated character is placed in bottom of the dice pile (face up) and the die card (face down).<br/><br/>For example: player one (Kajsa) gets Lonar, Cadran, Minx, Dag and Moog. She chooses Lonar, one of the most powerful characters in the game and attacks with brains/candle (value 8). Player two (Kalle) chooses to defend with his character with highest humour, but that is still only Silver (5). Kajsa takes the first card in the dice pile which is Ulg. Ulg has however only 1 eye on his T6. 8 + 1 = 9 in mental attack. Kalle draws the next card and gets Donolen who has 5 eyes on the T6. 5 + 5 = 10. Silver wins and is placed in front of Kalle along with Donolen. They are now battle weary and not available until everybody have fought. Kajsa's Lonar is discarded under the dice pile along with Ulg. But defeated cards like Lonar can return as an undead and is placed face up! Ulg is placed face down like all other cards. Kalle wins the battle and starts the next round.<br/><br/>If the numbers are even the result is a tie, place both characters in front of the players, they are also battle weary and not available. However the dice cards are discarded and not won. Continue battling until all characters have fought. If both players have character cards left after everybody has fought, pick them up again and repeat everything. Shuffle the dice pile again and remember to keep the undead face up. The one with the least cards start the next battle. If even use rock-papers-scissors to decide. If an undead gets into your army keep it upside down on your hand. When played it automatically defeats both the opponent and him/herself. Remove the undead from the game after battle. The loser is the player who lost all of his/her cards. If one player has more characters to play than the other those are rested until next round.<br/><br/>Try adding rules like that darker cards have +1 against lighter cards or that same silhouettes can&rsquo;t fight each other for example.<br/><br/>&mdash;description from the publisher<br/><br/>",

Set in the not too distant future of current day earth, devastated after an apocalyptic attack of aliens and demons, the grand opening of the Capes &amp; Chaos universe is revealed through this, the strategy card game. Included right out of the box are two full stand-alone versions, Basic Edition and Advanced Edition. Basic Edition plays as a &quot;medium-weight board game&quot; with fresh mechanics, and over 140 unique works of high quality art! Continuing right on top of Basic Edition, adding depth and enhancing strategy, Advanced Edition dives deeper into a &quot;dueling style&quot; card game, but with a twist! In Capes &amp; Chaos, while you are still competing against other players, you do not go head-to-head. Instead you will fight neutral opponents in a compelling mix of both new concepts and traditional elements of combat from tabletop RPGs. Capes &amp; Chaos is sure to deliver hours of hobby fun!<br/><br/>In Capes &amp; Chaos: Strategy Card Game you are taking on the role of a &quot;Titan&quot;, the most powerful of superhuman heroes. Your deck of cards represents your superpowers and military assets for protecting your people and fighting against the overwhelming chaos threatening what little remains of civilization. As part of a larger effort to protect the last bastions of society, Titans fight to defeat enemies and complete missions on the battlefield. In order to promote greater success, a friendly competition has ensued among the Titans. Who can defeat the most dangerous foes while completing their missions the fastest? Race against your fellow Titans to accumulate the most Threat Points!<br/><br/>As a Titan you will play with a constructed deck of &quot;Cape Cards&quot; and fight against a random assortment of &quot;Chaos Cards&quot; as the opposition of the game. Cape Cards do not have common card backs, each side is unique. One side shows the card's art, the other side shows the card's abilities. Basic Edition only uses the art side of the card, where as Advanced Edition uses both sides of the card.<br/><br/>There are no rule variations between Advanced Edition and Basic. Advanced builds right on top of Basic Edition by adding additional rules. Therefore Basic is either a stepping stone to Advanced and must be learned first, or a separate game to be enjoyed on its own merits.<br/><br/>Game length varies as the number of rounds to complete a game is determined by the players at the start of each game. At the end of the game, accumulated Threat Points are tallied to determine winner placements.<br/><br/>&mdash;description from the publisher<br/><br/>",

There's plenty of player interaction as you can connect your houses up to theirs, swap guests from their queues to yours, raise and lower the fear level of various guests with effects cards - all to keep players on their toes and ruin the most well laid of plans.<br/><br/>Your workers can head into town to research new house tiles, recruit more workers, promote their house and attract guests, or collect the necessary resources to build their house.<br/><br/>The workers also double as scarers! They can head into the house to help scare guests in the correct directions or they can work the queue at the front-of-house to prime guests for a more frightening experience. But be careful! Many guests have special attributes that can throw a wrench in things like &quot;Screamer&quot; - this guest will raise the fear level of every adjacent guest when they become scared! Use these different abilities to play guests off one another or interrupt other player's plans.<br/><br/>The only way to get cash is by admitting people to your house, they pay the second they come in whether they have a good time or not. As a guest enters, you'll slot them into a standee base with a rotating dial to track their fear level.<br/><br/>If guests have a good time, you can invite them to come back. If guests die, they take up precious storage bays and prevent you from storing the necessary resources to build up your house. If you kill too many guests, it means a change of management and a huge loss of points.<br/><br/>The gameplay goes on a night-by-night basis for 7 days leading up to halloween, resetting and paying workers at the end of each night. As the game wraps up after all the guests leave on Halloween night, Euro-style rules kick in and players reveal secret values each of their successfully scared guests contribute to their total score.<br/><br/>Spook House is a complex game with multiple strategies to win, currently clocking in around 3 hours for a full playthrough with four players. But it's still very early in development.<br/><br/>&mdash;description from the designer<br/><br/>",

The polar ice caps have melted, entire civilizations, swept away almost overnight. A distant rust-covered memory, the world we knew has been swallowed whole, lost in the murky depths of an unforgiving ocean.<br/><br/>Desperate, starving, and lacking the technical achievements of a forgotten era, the surviving population propels steam-powered engines towards the farthest corners of earth in search of the faintest glimmer of hope. Some found this hope on a plot of ocean simply known as the Arena. Through uncharted waters, there lies a thousand islands eroded by time, where untold riches await to be discovered by the remnants of past civilizations. You are among the desperate few in search of those lost treasures.<br/><br/>SteamPunk Arena is a turn-based strategy game with an objective to explore the islands looking for salvage, exploit the resources you find there, expand your domain using bridge networks,  and exterminate your opponent. In SteamPunk Arena, each combatant chooses a faction, and then chooses the hero who will lead that faction into battle. These heroes will help spur theatre-specific units on by providing an action modifying bonus.<br/><br/>The combatants begin the conflict with the same garrisoned unit strength and an equal amount of land; however, this is where your similarities will end. Where you place your Base Tile or Land Tiles is entirely up to you. What lies hidden and waiting to be discovered could also provide a unique advantage or disadvantage.  But keep in mind no matter what your path looks like, the dice-roll will often decide the outcome of events that transpire throughout the playthrough.<br/><br/>Using a turn-based unit action system. The combatant controls the action of active units throughout the duration of the turn until all action points are spent. The health of the unit is determined by a population or hit-point, found in the center of the piece. Units can only be deployed one per turn. There are only so many population points you can have active on the arena game boards at any given time, unless modified by a certain Resource or Unit Bonus. So choose your army wisely and enjoy the fight. We will see you out in the Arena!<br/><br/>",

That may be the reason for needing such well-trained men and women, or that could just be a coincidence.<br/>The training in Raivynwood starts at the ripe age of 5, these boys and girls are called the CIC (Combat Initiative Cubs). They mostly play with sticks and wooden shields in childish games that have a fortunate side-effect of teaching them how to kick butt. The Cubs graduate at the age of 7 when they become CIBs (Combat Initiative Bloomer). CIBs practice with dull metal weapons, begin to learn the bow and learn the value of respecting and helping their parents. It&rsquo;s an important lesson, you know? Finally, at the harsh age of 11, Bloomers get promoted to the Raivynwood CIA (Combat Initiative Adepts). As a junior member of the Raivynwood CIA it is your duty to train hard and watch over your small piece of paradise when the grownups aren&rsquo;t around.<br/>On this day, of all days&hellip; the day on which the grownups have all gone to the eastern forest edge to confront a new lizardfolk threat&hellip; misfortune has stricken.

        "description": "Ganjifa playing cards were introduced and popularized by Mughal emperors in the 16th century. It has always been one of the popular card games among Moghul Emperors, Emirs and Maharajas. When it was first established, the cards started spreading to many regions of India in the original form or Hindu form. Nowadays it&rsquo;s difficult to find a suitable deck to play in India. Only a small handful of artisans located in 2 cities still produce Ganjifa cards.<br/><br/>This is where we come in. Let me introduce you to Ganjifa Play.<br/><br/>In Ganjifa Play, players take turns playing suits, taking tricks, and building temples. Ganjifa Play is a trick-taking, hand management game for 2-4 players. Several chips are randomly drawn from the bag to determine (one round, one square, and one diamond) the highest suite symbol that round, the time of day, and the location.<br/><br/>The Round pawn sets the highest deck in the game for that round. The Raja of this suit goes first.<br/><br/>The Diamond pawn, with the time of day symbol indicates the suit that defines the direction of the game. For example, the player whose Raja matches the chosen time of day makes the toughest decision. Does gameplay go Clockwise or Counterclockwise?<br/><br/>The Square pawn defines the location. The players who Raja matches may exchange two cards of their choice with any two from an opponent&rsquo;s hand.<br/><br/>Once all cards have been played, players count their tricks to determine the winner that round. The winner places the base of their temple onto the mandala playing field. If a number of players have the same number of tricks, all players are deemed winners that round and should put the first part of their temple on the playing field.<br/><br/>The goal is to be the first player to build a complete temple made up of three parts.<br/><br/>&mdash;description from the designer<br/><br/>",

The game was designed for players of all skill and play types as it aims to be streamlined and straight forward. There are no excess mechanics and rules that other 4X style games seem to have, and this allows players to focus on having fun rather than reading rulebooks.<br/><br/>Players each take control of a Guild, and must make their Guild the dominant Guild in the region by whichever means the player chooses. Each Guild has minor perks that may aid a specific play style, but all of the Guilds are on a level playing field. No one Guild is stronger than any others, so choosing your Guild can be a simple as picking your favorite color or name.<br/><br/>Players take turns each moving their pieces around the board, building structures and collecting resources along the way. Heavily dependant on resource management, resources can be used to build more structures and units to increase a player's presence on the map and expand their borders even further. Players must be sure not to grow too quickly however, as in traditional 4X style, everything must be  taken care of. People must be fed and paid, and cities must be maintained. Grow too quickly and you won't be able to sustain your empire, grow too slowly and other players will surely beat you to the finish.<br/><br/>With no guidelines restricting player interaction, each of the players is highly encouraged to interact with one another through diplomatic talks. Alliances, war, declaration of friendships, trade, treaties, shunning, the list goes on. Players must bear in mind however the repercussions of their choices and how they may affect other players. With multiple paths to victory, Kingsfall caters to many different play styles. It is entirely possible to win without ever going to war, and it is also possible to win by only going to war. Ultimately the path to victory is up to the player.<br/><br/>Read the back story here<br/><br/>",

        "description": "Summary<br/>1. Board game , inspired by Trevi Fountain, is a good game for family which uses simple calculation. <br/>2. You have to play &lsquo;fountain cards&rsquo; to reach specific &lsquo;lucky number&rsquo; and get &lsquo;lucky token&rsquo;.<br/>3. Recommendations: Ages 8+ (Simple addition and subtraction ability is required.), 2~5 Players, 20~30 Min. to play.<br/><br/>Components<br/>1. Fountain cards: 80 Cards<br/>2. Starting cards: 4 Cards<br/>3. Round cards: 15 Cards<br/>4. Lucky token: 40 Tokens<br/>5. Highest combo card: 1 Card<br/><br/>Preparations<br/>1. Put 4 starting cards on the board side by side. Number &lsquo;7&rsquo; is written on starting cards. <br/>2. Shuffle fountain cards well and distribute 7 cards to each player. You should NOT show off your own cards to others.<br/>3. Make a deck with remaining cards. <br/>4. Gather all lucky tokens in one place.<br/>5. Shuffle 15 round cards and select random 5 cards to build round deck. Only 5 chosen cards will be used in this game.<br/>6. Show off the top card of round deck. Check the written number of token and place lucky tokens of that number next to round card.<br/>7. Start the game. The person who see fountain most recently is the first player.<br/><br/>There has ONLY 2 options! Play or Draw!<br/>On your turn, there has 2 options. <br/>Play the cards to earn points or Draw the cards to fill your hands. After that, your turn is over.<br/><br/>Action #1. Play the card(s). (Color match or Number match)<br/>Play the card(s) of your hand on the board.<br/>To do so, you must match color or number with current base card.<br/>Every time you play a card, current base card will be replaced to the last card you play. <br/>(In other words, base card will be changed every time you play a card.)<br/>You can play card again and again if color or number is same with replaced base card. Regardless of sign, number is matter. (&lsquo;-4&rsquo; and &lsquo;4&rsquo; are &lsquo;number matched&rsquo; in this game.)<br/>You cannot play cards on multiple area. You can only play ONE sequence of cards.<br/><br/>Point!<br/>Current base card changes every time someone plays a card to last played card. You can play cards again and again if color or number is matched.<br/>Because starting cards is &lsquo;7&rsquo; and there has no &lsquo;7&rsquo; in fountain cards, the first play must be &lsquo;color match&rsquo;.<br/><br/>Action #2. Draw the cards. (Draw 2 cards from deck)<br/>You don&rsquo;t want to or can&rsquo;t play card(s), draw 2 cards form deck to hand. <br/>All player can hold cards up to 7. If you are holding more cards, discard any card(s) to make 7 cards in your hand. Discarded card(s) will not be used in this game.<br/><br/>To get &lsquo;Lucky Token&rsquo;&hellip;!?<br/>Round card shows 2 information, &lsquo;Lucky number&rsquo; and &lsquo;Lucky token&rsquo;. &lsquo;Lucky number&rsquo; is goal of this round.<br/>&lsquo;Lucky token&rsquo; is reward of this round. <br/>After player finishes card playing, add all number from base card to last card. If result is same with &lsquo;lucky number&rsquo; of this round, that player can earn &lsquo;lucky token&rsquo; per each card that he (or she) plays.<br/>Even though player plays more cards than remaining token, player can earn remaining &lsquo;lucky token&rsquo; only.<br/>Before end of turn, put together all cards that player plays and put the last card on the top of pile to notice what is current base card. <br/>When all &lsquo;lucky token&rsquo; is distributed of this round, show off next top card of round deck and place written number of &lsquo;lucky token&rsquo;.<br/><br/>Point!<br/>Strategically, play as many cards as possible to earn more and give as less earning chance as possible to others.<br/><br/>The end of game<br/>When all &lsquo;lucky token&rsquo; of 5 rounds is distributed, the game ends immediately. <br/>If you are holding cards at the end of the game, that gives you a penalty.<br/>Discard your &lsquo;lucky token&rsquo; per each card you have. <br/>Who has token most is the winner of this game.<br/><br/>Point!<br/>You have to manage your fountain cards if you think end is coming!<br/><br/>",

During each turn, players work hard to collect resources, save creatures, and find artifacts all while trying to build a ship large enough to save all of their workers before Atlantis sinks. As players race against time and each other, Atlantis continues to sink around them. Players must juggle their time between building a ship to save themselves and risking everything in order to save all that Atlantis holds dear. Players receive bonus points for risking and saving precious items from around the island before they too are lost to the sea. <br/><br/><br/>The Goal of the Game:<br/><br/>The goal of the game is to acquire more victory points than any other player. Players receive victory points for building ship sections, collecting treasure tokens, and selling resources. Players lose victory points for each worker they were unable to save at the end of the game.<br/><br/>How Ark of Atlantis Plays:<br/> Players take turns placing their workers around the island. On a player&rsquo;s turn they can collect resources, build ship sections, or save valuable creatures, treasures, potions, and rare books from around the island to gain extra victory points. Each time a player places a worker or a group of workers they must then move their time track marker forward for each worker they placed. In Ark of Atlantis, the turn order is constantly changing depending on where a player&rsquo;s time track marker is positioned on the time track. If a player&rsquo;s marker lands on or passes over an event space the player draws an event card and then resolves it by flipping over an island tile. The second time an island tile would be flipped it is removed from the game. The game ends once all island tiles have been removed. Next, players tally up their victory points by adding any bonus points or deducting points for each worker they were unable to save. The player with the most points wins the game.<br/><br/>-description from designer<br/><br/>",

It combines elements of Chess with resource gathering and dice rolling mechanics on a 3D hexagonal tile map. It gracefully balances strategy and luck.<br/><br/>Jafabit is simple to set up and learn! Everything is color-coded and just makes sense. Maps look like maps complete with mountains and valleys. Everyone has a set of Chess-Dice they use to gather resources and dominate the map. Combining polyhedral dice and Chess pieces is what really brings Jafabit to a new level.<br/><br/>Jafabit is modular, with countless possible game maps to play on. A typical game lasts between a half an hour and a full hour, but can go a little longer. Jafabit is designed for ages 10 and up.<br/><br/>Jafabit is more than just a game it&rsquo;s a game system. There are numerous optional expansions already in the works. The first of these optional expansions is The Mists expansion and will be included in the initial release.<br/><br/>Layering new rules and pieces on top of Jafabit can result in an infinite world of possibilities - entirely new games with a simple and fun interface to tie them all together! The base mechanics just meld so nicely and are completely open to expansion.<br/><br/>&mdash;description from the designer<br/><br/>",

        "description": "Shuffle your way through classic gaming with Anarcade 8-Bit Rummy!  Play a set of cards from your hand with matching lines or mix up existing sets to find the matches you need.  Score by playing all your cards first and the first player with 8 points wins!<br/><br/>Anarcade 8-Bit Rummy is based on familiar rummy card game rules with a few twists.   All cards have a number (1-8) in each of three rows (top, middle or bottom).  The objective is to play cards from your hand by making sets of cards that have matching numbers in the same row.  You can also play cards directly to extend existing sets or rearrange sets into new ones using cards from your hand.  The winner of the round gets points for each of their opponents' remaining cards.<br/><br/>&mdash;description from the designer<br/><br/>",

        "description": "An intense cooperative, dice-rolling, unique tower defense set in a medieval fantasy world for 1 to 4 players. Have you ever wanted to be an archer on a castle wall? Now is your chance because all players play as archers defending against four powerful armies all attacking at once. Will the small band of archers defend the great castle of Godfrey or will the four Captains of the armies gain control of the castle? It is up to you and your team of archers so, &ldquo;Notch, Draw, Loose!&rdquo;<br/><br/>How To Win:<br/>Players win if all four Captains are killed before one reaches the Center of the Keep.<br/><br/>Players lose if:<br/>&gt;&gt; A Captain reaches the Keep at the center of the Inner Court. <br/>&gt;&gt; All ten soldiers of any one army are placed on their quadrant in the bailey.<br/>&gt;&gt; The Player&rsquo;s Deck has no more cards left to draw.<br/><br/>General Gameplay:<br/>The goal of the game is to kill all 4 Captains before 1 advances to the Keep. Archers will be attacking the Captains with their arrows while eliminating the invading armies. Players will also use cards and purchase items from the Archer&rsquo;s Equipment to accomplish this goal.<br/><br/>Every normal arrow is worth 1 damage unless otherwise stated on the cards or with special abilities. Each archer has 5 arrows and 5 spaces to move each turn.<br/><br/>The 12mm dice are the soldiers of the different armies that are invading the castle. The health of a soldier is determined by what it rolls. Archers can ONLY attack soldiers in their row of their quadrant. Archers kill soldiers with their arrows by reducing the soldier&rsquo;s health down to 0.  Archers receive an Archer Trophy for each soldier they kill during their turn. Archers will use these trophies to purchase equipment to help them defeat the Captains.<br/><br/>When a soldier's health reaches 0, then remove that dice from the bailey and place it back on its army&rsquo;s card in the Gathering Area. The soldier dice will be rolled again and placed in a future round.<br/><br/>Archers do NOT receive an Archer Trophy if soldier dice are killed while being placed during the Enemy phase. However, Archers do earn trophies for soldier dice killed by barrels and cards that upgrade their arrows.<br/><br/>Most of the cards are split and have two options.  Players choose one option to play and then discard. Players CANNOT play both of the options on the split cards. Split cards are designed to help for the different situations that players find themselves in.<br/><br/>Each round has two phases: Archer Phase and Enemy Phase.<br/><br/>Archer Phase<br/>Each Archer Phase consists of all 4 archers taking their turns.<br/><br/>Player&rsquo;s Turn:<br/>Draw 1 Card <br/>Add to hand or follow the instructions if it is an Enemy Card. &ldquo;Captain Advance&rdquo; cards advance the Captain to the next space in their trail toward the Keep at the center of the Inner Court.<br/>&ldquo;Extra Soldier&rdquo; cards will add an additional soldier to be placed during the Enemy Phase of that round (<br/><br/>2) Anytime during an archer&rsquo;s turn they may:<br/>Move 5 spaces and Shoot 5 arrows.<br/>Play 1 card from your hand OR purchase items from the Archer's Equipment<br/>If you purchase items, then you CANNOT play a card in the same turn.<br/>If you play a card, then you CANNOT purchase items in the same turn.<br/><br/>3) Discard for hand limit<br/>4) Pass the 1st player Castle Token to the person on your left (Clockwise)<br/><br/>Player&rsquo;s Movement:<br/>Archers are allowed to move to any space along the castle walls with a yellow border. Only one archer is allowed on each space along the wall. However, two archers may be on a &ldquo;Starting Position&rdquo; at the same time while they are moving along the wall. And as archers move past another archer, they CANNOT shoot arrows in the row of the other archer as they pass over them.<br/><br/>Stairs do not count as a space, the Archers just walk through them to the next space with a yellow border. Start positions do count as one space when the Archers are moving around to the other wall.<br/><br/>Enemy Phase<br/>Each Enemy phase begins immediately following the Archer Phase. <br/>The Enemy Phase consists of 3 elements:<br/>Roll the d8 Captain dice and resolve.<br/>Check what number you rolled with the Roman numerals on the 4 corner towers. Whatever number you rolled, the Captain in that quadrant advances one space.<br/><br/>If the Captain is in the bailey,then add a rolled soldier in the space that the Captain advanced from.<br/><br/>If the Captain is in the Inner Court, then resolve any Barricades that they might have passed through. No soldiers are ever placed in the Inner Court.<br/><br/>If that Captain is dead, then nothing happens. Take a deep breathe. You DO NOT re-roll if you rolled to advance a dead Captain.<br/>Roll the Soldier Placement dice for each of the 4 armies and place 2 soldiers on to each quadrant of the bailey.<br/><br/>Roll 8 new soldiers (2 for each army) and place them on the two soldier positions of their army card. These will be placed in the next round during the Enemy Phase.<br/>The highest health is placed in position #1<br/>The lowest health is placed in position #2<br/><br/>After rolling the NEXT soldiers and placing them on their army cards, then the Archer Phase of the next round begins<br/><br/>",

Utilising the &quot;everything in one box&quot; model, everyone who plays Soulbound will be able to experience the game as it is intended to be, without the financial investment hurdle. Feel the thrill of commanding creatures of mythology to become the next Soulbound!<br/><br/>Along with creatures of mythology, Soulbound introduces a unique take on explaining what happened to these creatures that stoppped their existence in Modern Day planet Earth. Explore how the unknown war of the heavens and hell, known as &quot;The Vanishing&quot;, caused Pandora's Box to thrust creatures of mythology and Gods alike into an alternate reality of planet Earth, known as Axiom07 by the greater beings. To the local population, the planet is called Duhra, and they have no idea about the darkness that they will have to fight back in order to survive.<br/><br/>Soulbound is the world's first battle card game that gives you the authentic Trading Card Game experience, while incorporating a heavy influence from Tactical Turn-Based Strategy Role-Playing games and a &quot;Dynamic Resource&quot; system. With Melee creatures, Ranged creatures and Support creatures, players will get to make new kinds of tactical decisions.<br/><br/>Every game of Soulbound comes with every card available. It also comes with two starter decks pre-configured so that players can learn that game before jumping in to the deck building aspect. In a box, 2 players can easily create two competitive decks. For the most competitive players, they may find they need a copy of the game for their own. With an abundance of available cards to build decks from, your ability to make the correct tactical decisions will be the biggest difference in a game. Skill should always determine the best player, not the player with the deepest pockets.<br/><br/>Soulbound is played over a series of turns in which you, an Animan of the planet Duhra, command creatures in battle against other Animan to work your way up to the title of &quot;Soulbound&quot; and be entrusted with fighting back the darkness that escaped from Pandora's Tome. Utilising your own Soul Energy, you begin your turn by building up your resource to Call creatures to the field. Creatures are able to act the turn they are played to the field which creates a very high tempo game. Having a strong offence is just as important as having a strong defence, as your resource also acts as your life force. Throughout a game, it can be attacked and fluctuates because of that. No linear resource growth here.<br/><br/>Through the many creatures' abilities and combat, players attempt to make tactical decisions to break through the opponent's defences and deal damage to the opponent's resource. A skillful players will be able to manage both their own resource and their opponent's resource to ensure they always can have the upper hand.<br/><br/>With outstanding table presence, outstanding art, and outstanding gameplay, Soulbound will keep you engaged and constantly creating new combos in your head. In the end, the only thing that matters is dealing 60 Soul Damage to your opponent and claiming your spot among the Soulbound.<br/><br/>&mdash;description from the publisher<br/><br/>",

Players choose their Heroes. There are 4 female and 4 male Heroes, each with their unique powers. Heroes are young witches and wizards, entering the School of Magic. A game session spans a semester of their life. Players get the Hero Card and the matching Item- and Spell Cards.<br/><br/>2. The Game Master (can be teacher, senior student, parent, etc.) assembles the Deck of Exercises. There are cards of 3 difficulty levels: Easy, Medium and Hard and a certain number must be selected from each category. Subjects include Math, History, Science and general Trivia, with curricula that matches education from age of 10 to 16.<br/><br/>3. The Game Master selects (or randomly draws) a Boss Monster for the game session. All other game components (Cards, tiles, tokens, sheets, etc.) are placed near the gameboard.<br/><br/>4. Players can move on the board by either rolling 2s6 (random mode) or use Movement Cards, giving a more strategic angle to the game. As players move on the board (from Field 1 to Field 30), the following steps will happen:<br/><br/>Depending on the Field they landed on, they either draw a single Exercise Card matching the symbol on the field (Easy, Medium, Hard), or a Fortune Card for every player.<br/><br/>(a) If it was an Exercise Card, they get 3, 5 or 10 minutes to solve the Easy, Medium or Hard problems. They can use pen and paper, they can talk to each other - they can even ask for help from the Game Master. If they successfully solved the problem, they get rewards. Every player who successfully solved her exercise will get Rune Golds. If at least one player solved it correctly, they get Team Rune Golds. Red (Hard) cards yield Magic Items as well.<br/><br/>Also, every player with a successful solution can place a Dungeon Tile. Tiles will form the combat grid for the final battle. There are symbols on the tiles indicating that the player can draw an extra Spell or Item card when placing that Tile. And certain Tiles will summon monsters for the final battle.<br/><br/>(b) If it was a Fortune Card, each player gets one and resolve the effect immediately. There are supporting ones (gain bonuses, draw items, etc) and there are negative ones (lose bonuses, get cursed, etc).<br/><br/>5. The three corners on the Board (Classroom, Club and Magic Rental) are places where the team must stop, even if they would overstep it.<br/><br/>(a) Classroom: they can select an Exercise Card of any difficulty to solve<br/>(b) Club: they can either play a minigame (not included in the box, choose anything you like to distract players for a bit), or have a little break<br/>(c) Magic Rental: after completing the mandatory Red Exercise on Field 30, players can spend their Rune Golds on Items and Spell. They are more than encouraged to collaborate and communicate, to figure out some kind of strategy before entering the final combat. The identity of the Boss Monster is revealed at this point.<br/><br/>6. Once they are well equipped, it's time for the Final Battle! Heroes descend to the Dungeons to defend the school from attacking monsters! Final Battle is a turn-based combat using cards and a d20 dice.<br/><br/>Heroes and Monsters take their turn, with the order depending on their Movement value. Monsters are controlled by the Game Master, following the behaviour detailed on the corresponding combat sheet.<br/><br/>(a) Movement: a figure can make a number of steps equal to its Movement value. It can step in any direction on the Grid, it can even overstep friendly figures, but cannot cross walls or hostile squares.<br/><br/>(b) Use Card: after or before the Movement is completed, Heroes can use a single card each turn. It can be a spell (usually turned face down after use), or a weapon (can be used any number of times in a combat). Ranged attacks must consider line-of-sight with walls and other objects blocking the way.<br/><br/>Combat lasts until the last survivor, with Heroes getting extra Rune Golds as loot. They can use this during their next game session.<br/><br/>",

Players manage an economy of resources and play event cards in order to build and expand an empire and destroy their opponents.  There is only one winner in every game of Kingslayer, but there are three paths to victory:  slay an opposing king, control 20 territories, or control the most territories when the deck of event cards runs out.  Kingslayer, at it's core, is an exercise in resource management.<br/><br/>Players will spend their resources to send their units into unclaimed territories and to build settlements.  Each territory may contain one settlement and for every settlement built players can add a resource to the resource pool.  Players may use their new resources to continue to move units, build settlements, or attack opposing units.  Players may also spend their resources on recruiting new units, which may only be placed on the same territory as their king, which can not move.  Combat is decided through dice rolls and favors outnumbering your opponent as well as the attacker.<br/><br/>Kingslayer uses a unique turn order mechanic which moves in a clockwise order, but only for players with at least one resource currently in the resource pool.  If a player doesn't have any resources in the resource pool, their turn is skipped.  If no resources of any color are in the resource pool, the pool is refreshed and all players draw a card.  As long as players have at least one resource in the resource pool, they may play one card on their turn instead of spending resources.<br/><br/>&mdash;description from the designer<br/><br/>",

        "description": "In this game, not only you can build a crypto empire, but also you can try to manipulate the market to gain advantage for your own coin or invest and trade your opponents&rsquo; coins to benefit from their success or failures.<br/><br/>Crypto When Lambo (CWL) board game was inspired by crypto fortunes that were made and lost overnight. Your goal is to build a crypto empire with your own crypto company and coin to become the most successful crypto investor.<br/><br/>The game takes place across the 8 cities of the world that contain 64 resource producing city tiles. You begin the game with 3 offices, 2 crypto company share cards (each representing 1 million coins), and 5 million game currency. The first player to reach 1 billion or 50 Winning Point Count (WPC) wins the game.<br/><br/>To gain WPCs, you must increase the number of your employees, build products, open new offices, complete your management team, ICO your coin, and list it on crypto exchanges. There are 5 resource types (Real Estate, Employee, Management Team, Product, and Crypto Exchange) in the game that allow you to perform various actions to gain points and make money. For example, using 2 Real Estate cards and paying 2 million, you can establish a new office. Each office placed on the board is 2 WPCs and each Product you produce is worth 2 WPCs. There are multiple paths to getting additional points such as by becoming the richest person in the crypto world or leading a crypto company to ICO with several products and employees dominating the markets.<br/><br/>How do you acquire these resources? It&rsquo;s very simple. Each turn a player rolls the dice and the total determines which city production centers will produce resources. Different cities have different attributes. For example, New York and London have more management talent but real estate is harder to get. Hong Kong has a lot of employees that can be recruited. New York is highly regulated and harder to have Crypto Exchanges whereas Tokyo and Hong Kong have more Crypto Exchanges that are accessible.<br/><br/>How do you earn money? For example, 1 Product card can be traded for 5 million. Other resource cards can be traded for 1 million. You can also trade your resources with other players during your turn. You can also do Crypto Trading during your turn and risk some of your money for potential high reward. You can also make money by buying low and selling high your opponents&rsquo; coins by manipulating the market with CWL Action Cards.<br/><br/>In CWL, your most important asset is your crypto company shares. You start the game with 2 of 10 company share cards, each representing 1 million coins. In the beginning of the game your coins have zero value. This is tracked by the Coin Price ticker cards you have in front of you always visible to all players.  You must try to acquire as many as your company share cards as you can while they have zero value. You can also acquire other players&rsquo; share cards before they go ICO to benefit from their ICO price hype. Picking the right time for ICO will determine the revenue you will get from your ICO. Number of products, employees, management team, and manipulation of markets will all affect the coin price. You should try to increase your coin price as high as possible before launching your ICO while trying to manipulate your opponents&rsquo; coin prices. This is all done by using combination of resource cards.<br/><br/>In order to ICO, a player has to own at least 5 company share cards, a Board of Directors Management card, one of the C-level management cards (CEO, CFO, CIO or CISO) and at least one Employee card. One well timed successful ICO could take you from several million to well above 500 million. ICO is worth 10 WPCs.<br/><br/>There is a strategy involved around placement of Offices on the board in the beginning of the game to trading and manipulation of coin prices to timing of the ICO to raise money. Every game develops differently due to actions of each player.<br/><br/>CWL is full of fun with trading, resource management, market manipulation, and teaming concepts. It is simple to learn but hard to master with all the strategies available to you.<br/><br/>Get ready for your first adventure on CWL. Have fun building your Crypto Empire!<br/><br/>-description from designer<br/><br/>",

Players are encouraged to trade anything they want, and with only two simple moves, the game can really begin moving at a quick pace.<br/><br/>One interesting piece of Art Major is that paint only comes in primary colors (Red, Blue, Yellow), but most paintings require secondary colors (Orange, Green, Purple) to be complete.

        "description": "Aboleo is a two-player strategy board game played on an Aboleo board. On the surface, the board resembles a chess or checkers board but has some significant differences. It is a checkered game board with 64 squares arranged in an eight-by-eight grid with each square containing two dots (one at the lower left and one at the upper right) or circles indicating the proper positioning of a player&rsquo;s piece within the square.&nbsp;<br/><br/>Each player begins the game with 16 pieces: one king, one general, two chariot units, two cavalry units, two archer units, and eight infantry units. Each of the six piece types moves differently. An additional piece which is not present at the beginning of the game, is the noble. The noble piece replaces any infantry unit that makes it to the opposing player&rsquo;s side of the board and moves in the exact same fashion as the king. The objective is to 'Aboleo' or abolish the opponent's nobility by executing three attacks resulting in the &ldquo;death&rdquo; of the piece. If the king is killed and no other nobility exists, the game is ended. If a noble exists, that piece is then promoted to king and game play continues. This is called a &ldquo;coronation&rdquo;. If more than one noble exists, the player has the option of choosing which piece is promoted to king.<br/><br/>To this end, a player's pieces are used to attack and kill the opponent's pieces, while supporting their own. In addition to Aboleo, the game can be won by voluntary resignation by the opponent, this would typically occur when too many forces have been lost, or if the player feels that the death of his nobility is unavoidable. A game may not result in a draw unless both players agree to concede.<br/><br/>&mdash;description from the designer<br/><br/>",

These  resulted in nearly 100 Israeli dead and injured as well as extensive property damage, including private Israeli homes. In response, Israeli Prime Minister Levi Eshkol authorized a retaliatory raid, dubbed Operation Shredder, into the southwest corner of the West Bank against the town of Samu&rsquo; and several other villages south of the city of Hebron. The raid was carried out by the Israeli 35th Paratrooper Brigade, supported by tanks, armored halftracks, aircraft and artillery. It was the largest invasion of Jordanian territory to that point, and meant to convey a strong message that Israel&rsquo;s restraint in the face of these attacks was at an end.<br/><br/>Unfortunately, Jordan&rsquo;s King Hussein, ruler of the West Bank, was the sole Arab leader seeking a path of moderation with the Jewish State. For nearly three years the King had been meeting secretly with Golda Meir, the Israeli Foreign Minister, in an effort to forestall another war in the region and to find some path to peace. US President Johnson had helped facilitate these meetings, and supported King Hussein with these initiatives. The Israeli strike at Samu&rsquo; was fraught with peril, both militarily and politically. Can you do better?<br/><br/>Each copy of Shredding Peace is composed of the following:<br/><br/>Two 11 by 17 inch hex map sheets with game charts and tables.<br/>91 un-mounted, double-sided counters<br/>8 pages of rules<br/><br/>Infantry (Airborne, Headquarter) and Heavy Weapons are all Companies of about 100 to 120 men. Tank and the armored car units represent 2 vehicles, and each halftrack represents 4 vehicles. A hex on the map is about three quarters of a mile across. Each turn represents one half hour of time. The game uses a standard deck of playing cards and a ten sided die for play.<br/><br/>Shredding Peace is designed by Paul Rohrbaugh and features graphics by Dariusz Buraczewski.<br/><br/>",

Up to four players will play as Hunters tasked with finding and slaying the Three Witches of W&uuml;rzburg before the opposing player-led Coven completes the Ritual.<br/><br/>Hunters will interrogate Prisoners from the Tribunal Deck to reveal unknown tiles on the gaming board in order to find Arcana Tiles. These allow to draw &ldquo;leads&rdquo; from the Arcana Deck and ultimately force the Witches to reveal themselves and fight. Hunters need to act fast, because the Coven will complete the Ritual in 8 turns.<br/><br/>The Coven&rsquo;s powers are great, but its fight against time is no less dire. The Coven&rsquo;s player controls each turn&rsquo;s conditions by drawing from the Orbis Deck and can deal gruesome spells from his Maleficia Deck. He gains power from the Ritual and can summon Creatures. Each of these is based on the darkest German myths and can go toe-to-toe with any Hunter, but at the same time is specialized in a tactical role and could easily be wasted.<br/><br/>The Hunters and the Coven fight for board control: each struggles to mix favorable cards into the decks controlled by the opponent. A streamlined dice combat system favors decisive action, hard choices and risk-taking. Cooperation and resource-pooling is needed between Hunters to secure equipment and plan actions against the Coven. Rash decisions can spell ruin for both sides, since the number of Hunter &ldquo;lives&rdquo; are limited, and each Creature can only be summoned once. Each game set will contain original art and (unpainted) miniatures for Witches, Creatures and the Hunters.<br/><br/>-description from designer<br/><br/>",

        "description": "Squex is a 2-player abstract connection game, similar to Hex.<br/>The game is played on a 8x8 board of octagons and squares. The goal of each player is to connect their corresponding sides of the board with a continuous line of pieces.<br/><br/>How to play:<br/><br/>     On their turn, each player can place one octagonal piece on any free octagonal place on the board.<br/>     If a piece is placed diagonally to a piece of the same color, a square of that color is placed to connect them (it is possible to place up to 4 squares by placing just one octagon).<br/>     If a piece is placed diagonally to a piece of the same color and there is a square of the opponent's color in between them, the opponent's square is replaced by a square of the player's color. The opponent's octagons are no longer connected by the square that was there. This is called a &quot;cut&quot;.<br/>     Whenever a player performs a &quot;cut&quot;, the opponent can then play two times in a row (it should be noted that if a player performs a &quot;cut&quot; on the first of two consecutive turns, they lose the second turn and it's the opponent's turn to play twice).<br/>     A player only wins when they connect their respective sides of the board and it is impossible for the opponent to ever break that connection with a &quot;cut&quot;. Usually after a player connects two sides there are still three of four more turns until the connection is &quot;uncutable&quot;.<br/><br/><br/>&mdash;description from the designer<br/><br/>",

        "description": "The Backstory<br/><br/>In the beginning there was darkness, all-encompassing, complete darkness. A black hole that hungered to consume everything. This darkness is called Demogargano. But there was also light, glimmering and blinding, known to man as God. Existing separate from each other until by chance, or fate, they collided stealing energy from each other creating a new existence. Life blossomed, evolved, and thrived. Like two sides of a coin the light and dark coexisted and influenced man. As time went by the light created Hell as a means to quarantine evil caused by the darkness. Lucifer&rsquo;s fight with God and his ultimate exile resulted in his right to rule Hell.<br/><br/>Lucifer enjoyed his rule for a millennia until he started to sense the rise in darkness and the existence of Demogargano. After having visons of Demogargano he experienced fear for the first time and left the Golden Bastille in Hell to go into hiding. With his absences many saw the opportunity to seize the power of Hell and three factions were formed. The order of the Devil lead by Belial, seeks to preserve Lucifer&rsquo;s rule for his eventual return, maintaining the power structures as they are. The Council of Hate consists of the armies and legions of hell, military class demons, ruled by Beelzebub. The Council of Hate seeks to bring order to the chaos of Hell no matter the cost, but they also want to destroy Lucifer&rsquo;s legacy and shift the balance of power. The Horde are the embodiment of chaos and pandemonium. They are ruthless, mindless demons who want to overrun Hell and destroy everything in their path. Astaroth is the only one that can control them and keep their bedlam at bay.  Baal, a powerful sorcerer, and second in command of the Horde, turns on Astaroth and casts a spell banishing him to another dimension.<br/><br/>Lilith, the queen of Hell and estranged wife of Lucifer, senses that Astaroth has vanished and she fears the Horde will over run Hell with Baal at the helm. She finds Baal and challenges him to a battle to the death and wins. By doing so she left the Horde with no leaders, in turn granting them greater power and increasing Demogargano&rsquo;s grip on the world. Lilith could travel through dimensions but she could not sense or locate Astaroth from Baal's spell.  In that moment, Demogargano&rsquo;s presence strengthened and Lilith is seized by the same visions that Lucifer suffered. In effort to preserve Hell and stop Demogargano from destroying everything, she forms the HellBringers. They are a rag tag group of demons, men, creatures, mercenaries, wizards, cyborgs, and the most bad ass pug ever. They are tasked with stopping Demogargano and raising a little hell along the way.  (The story continues in HelllBringers #0, which can be found in the Art of Mark May Volume 1)<br/><br/>The Game<br/><br/>HellBringers is a card game stemming from the HellBringers first appearance in comics back in 2015 which can be found in the &quot;The Art of Mark May Volume 1&quot;.  Since then the universe has grown to not only include a wide range of intriguing and powerful characters. The villains are what make HellBringers unique.  Set in deep culture and a plethora of mythologies from around the world, HellBringers brings characters from all walks of existence.<br/><br/>The full 52 card deck comes with 42 characters to introduce you to the HellBringers universe and 10 special weapons cards for multipliers to help you with those BOSS battles! There are 3 ways to play #HellBringers!  Gauntlet Mode, Survivor Series Mode, (Both due in August) and the Game Board mode coming in October!<br/><br/>How to play<br/><br/>You need two dice, a paper pad, and something to write with to keep track of hit points.  To enhance the hellish experience, 2 skull dice are included with the full game with mat if you buy that reward option. The cards themselves have SILVER FOIL on the front to make everything shiny! Oh....shiny!  Fun to look at. Cards have 6 stat categories that make up a character&rsquo;s total hit points.  The game is played by rolling the dice and using total rolls to take off hit points as an attack. There are weapons cards that act as multipliers and every time you roll doubles it means something different.  Can you get through the first battle of gauntlet or map mode?  Are you ready to bring hell upon your enemies?<br/><br/>Here are the rules for the game!<br/><br/>There are three ways to play HellBringers. Survivor Series (Card deck needed only), Board Game mode, or Gauntlet mode (Card deck needed only)<br/><br/>First take out any card with a 666 or 000 attached to it and put it in separate pile for later. Here are the rules for doubles and the categories for stats.<br/><br/>Rolling Doubles:<br/><br/>     1&rsquo;s Into the Snakes Eyes : Instant kill<br/>     2&rsquo;s Double Deuces: Restart battle (All HP reset)<br/>     3&rsquo;s The Tribus &ndash; Attack is 3 times what you roll for the next attack roll. <br/>     4&rsquo;s The Four Highwaymen Cometh &ndash; Choose a card from the deck to help you attack for the rest of the battle. This card cannot be attacked by opponent and will be put back in deck after battle. Do not get to keep for future battles. <br/>     5&rsquo;s The Five have Risen &ndash; Gain back ALL HP<br/>     6&rsquo;s One More to Summon Him &ndash; Roll again , If you can roll a 6 on either dice than you summon Demogargano to fight for you for the rest of the battle. <br/><br/><br/>Stat Categories:<br/><br/>     Evil Within<br/>     Magic<br/>     Durability<br/>     Strength<br/>     Fighting Ability<br/>     Intelligence<br/><br/><br/>All categories are added up for total HP of any character.<br/><br/>Survivor Series mode:<br/><br/>2 players draw 6 cards a piece. One each until 6 are laid out. They then use 2 dice to roll and determine how much an attack has taken of their opponents HP (Health Points). Overall HP is determined by the combined total of the stat categories on the back of the card. The attack is subtracted from that total number until it reaches zero in which case the opponent is defeated. A notepad is suggested to keep up with HP and attack subtractions. In Survivor Series mode you face off 6 vs. 6 and you can choose to attack anyone in the deck for your turn. Once the card for the opponent is eliminated he goes into a defeated card pile. This continues until the player has defeated all of his opponents cards. The player then gets to revive any fallen cards he may have endured as well as the opponents cards and choose any 6 out of them to proceed forward to fight Demogargano. However, before you do that you must first draw a weapon card from the deck of the weapons cards. Weapons cards act as multipliers for attacks which you will need against Demogargano who will vastly out number you in HP. You also now get your 7th member of your team to help you defeat Demogargano. This is where you will roll one dice. If you get a 1 you get the &ldquo;Bum Jesus&rdquo; card, if you get a 2 you get the Norgren card, if you get a 3 or 4 you get Attila, and finally, if you get a 5 or 6 you get Astaroth. These cards feature different results. Norgren, Attila, and Astaroth all have 666 in one stat category making their total HP brought to the group a welcome asset and required in order to defeat Demogargano as he has 3 over 666 categories. Bum Jesus who you will receive if you roll a one has a 000 stat category making him able to sacrifice himself in order to defeat Demogargano without even rolling the dice. Meaning if you roll a 1 with the dice you win the game instantly.<br/><br/>The game can be played by two people or by yourself battling yourself to see who goes to fight Demogargano.<br/><br/>Gauntlet Mode:<br/><br/>In Run the Gauntlet mode the game play of HellBringers is the same except that when you and your opponent draw your first cards you instantly battle them. When the opponent&rsquo;s card is defeated you will then put that card in a separate pile for later. The player then keeps the card with the battle damage of HP that was suffered from the battle. The opponent then draws another card and the battle damaged card from before fights that card. Both players get 6 cards in total and they battle this way until no cards are left for the opponent. The player then chooses 6 cards from his pile and the defeated pile to fight Demogargano and the rules are the same as Survivor Series for the final battle. See above.<br/><br/>Board Game Version:<br/><br/>Players rolls one dice.  Player moves spaces until reaching weapons card pick up slots, team builder slots, and also battle zones. Players have the option of killing player and gaining double attack or having player join their team in the battle zones. Weaker players would be a reason you would kill of a player in order to double your attack. At this point you are choosing the bolster your attack rather gain HP of total team. Weapons cards act as modifiers. Team building is the goal of the board along with minor battles before you make it to the end of the game where you fight Demogargano.  Unlike the card deck game version, you do not have the option of rolling for a special character at the end.  You must make up your team as you go and if you are defeated in battle you have to start over.  Game is 1-3 players and you can play by yourself as you just need to roll for the opponent as well during battles.  During battles doubles mean the same as in regular card deck versions of the game.<br/><br/>Amazing Contributing Artist<br/><br/>Incredible art from the likes of Mark May, Marat Mychaels, Bob Camp, Chris Giarrusso, Ed Smith, Sean Forney, Steven Pulawa, Ryan Kincaid, Phil Spaulding, Cara Nicole, Brady Overstreet, Rick Lozano, Russ Casseday, and Sara Frazetta (Her first published work, granddaughter of the GOAT Frank Frazetta)!

The player who wrote the best story (by popular vote) wins!<br/><br/>The game has two phases. In the first phase, players have hands of cards: nouns, adjectives, and a few special cards. Each noun card has the noun itself as well as questions that establish relationships to that noun. On a player's turn, there are three possible actions:<br/><br/>     They may play a noun (potentially along with adjectives describing it), connecting it through the questions to a noun already on the board<br/>     They may add an adjective to an existing noun<br/>     They may play a special card<br/><br/><br/>After seven noun cards are on the board, players proceed to the second phase of the game, where they each write a story interpreting the web of nouns and relationships formed by the cards. When the players are done, they read the stories aloud, then vote on a favorite. Whoever wrote that story wins.<br/><br/>&mdash;description from the designer<br/><br/>",

Landing on a space gives the player the option of buying the property. When a player collects all the properties in one color group, the properties can be improved by building. When players land on a space owned by another player they must pay rent. Rent is determined by the location of the property and the number of improvements on the space. Some spaces instruct a player to draw a card which can be beneficial or harmful to the player. Players must avoid going bankrupt to stay in the game.

Uncontaminated water on Earth is scarce and so it is the chosen commodity and the benchmark used to evaluate your success in competition with the 5 other Corporations.<br/> Your Earth Corp is sending you, on a yearly basis, a diminishing amount of water from Earth for your use on your satellite. You utilize this water to activate &quot;Squishy&quot; (men) and &quot;Crunchy&quot; (robots) stored on your satellite. You use Squishy and Crunchy to drop down from your satellite to a constantly rotating planet Mars to explore the hidden terrain and discover water resources. Each Squishy that holds a terrain hex at the end of the fiscal year will provide water to send back to Earth in a running tally with the highest total at the end of the game being awarded the Monopoly of Mars for their Corporation.<br/><br/>Each Fiscal Year is divided into 4 Quarters and a Fiscal Year End. During the turn order players: receive water from Earth and roll for safe transit; active Squishy and Crunchy units; bid on the Chair; resolve storm movement and damage; determine and wait for Mars rotation; move units down to and around on Mars; resolve hex control through conflict; resupply their units on the surface with water from the satellite; accumulate profit points for terrain held; attempt to discover Alien Tech; and generally mess with the competition whenever they can using MarsNeedsYou Cards.<br/><br/>MarsNeedsYou Cards are held by players and used to benefit themselves or mess with the competition. Players also bid with water for a &quot;Chairmanship&quot; which allows them to roll to determine the amount of rotation of Mars before players are allowed to move their Squishy and Crunchy to the surface. &quot;Chairman&quot; also get to decide which of all the players will go first, with play proceeding in a clockwise order. This allows them to decide where they would like to be in the order of play. Where conflict occurs between multiple players for a terrain hex the &quot;Chairman&quot; also decides who fights first, even if they are involved in the conflict. And speaking of conflict, players who move their units onto other player occupied terrain hex are now in &quot;Strenuous Negotiations&quot; and must roll dice to determine who will hold the terrain and reap the profit from it and who will die and be rendered back into water for collection. If a player is not involved in any conflict they may pay water and roll for the chance to collect an Alien Tech Card which will provide them with an advantage courtesy of found Mars Alien Technology.<br/><br/>At the end of the last Fiscal Year, players count up their profit and any game bonuses for things like holding specific terrain or having the most Squishy on Mars and see how much total profit they have sent back to Earth.  The player who squeezes the most profit from Mars is granted the development monopoly and wins the conflict!<br/><br/>-description from designer<br/><br/>",

        "description": "From Gamecrafters: &quot;Temptation of the Sphinx Diamond is an easy to learn bluffing game for 2-4 players.<br/><br/>The year is 1926. The astounding Sphinx Diamond has been brought to London from Egypt. A glamorous masquerade party is being thrown to celebrate its unveiling. However, thieves lurk among the city&rsquo;s rich and famous, each planning to steal the rare jewel. In Temptation of the Sphinx Diamond, players take on the role of a thief in disguise. They must guard their true identity while using poison to eliminate their competition.&quot;<br/><br/>---<br/><br/>Temptation of the Sphinx Diamond is a quick, fast-paced mystery card game in which players are attempting to be the last one standing without having other players uncover their secret identity. The game has two sets of characters: one set is masked, which are placed down in a row in the center of the table, the others are unmasked and one is secretly dealt to each player. Each player is now working to keep their character alive (no poison cards played on the character) until the end of the game.<br/><br/>In addition to the character cards, there are poison and antidote cards and three (3) item cards that can be added for varying levels of difficulty.<br/><br/>Each player takes two (2) actions on their turn:<br/><br/>&bull; Draw a card (poison or antidote)<br/>&bull; Play a card - play a poison on ANY character even if they are already poisoned. The poison remains on the character until any players play an antidote with the matching icon on a poisoned character to remove a poison. (Example: Snake antidote will remove a snake poison on a character.<br/>&bull; Move an item - The items sit above the characters and can be moved to an adjacent character.<br/><br/>The base game is played with just the Mirror in play. When the mirror is above a character, that character cannot have poisoned played on them. (Antidotes can be played.)<br/><br/>When there is one (1) character that has no poison cards on them the game ends. The player who is that character will reveal themselves and they are the winner. However, if that character is NOT one of the player characters, the game resumes.<br/><br/>The Sphinx Diamond and Opera Glasses items can be added to the mix to up the difficulty of the game. They move in the same way as the mirror but have different effects. The Opera glasses item allows players to peek at each other's hand of cards. The Sphinx Diamond changes the win condition: In order to win, the player must be the last character with no poisons AND have the Sphinx Diamond above their character.<br/><br/>",

        "description": "Thunder Upon the Water details the battle of Albemarle Sound fought on May 5th, 1864. Via the sound&rsquo;s numerous ports Confederate blockade runners brought badly needed supplies for the rebel nation. In April a Confederate army supported by the new ironclad CSS Albemarle, captured the Union held port of Plymouth. Encouraged by this success, Confederate General Robert Hoke planned an offensive to recapture the city of Bern, held by Union forces for nearly two years.<br/><br/>Captain of the CSS Albemarle, James W. Cooke, steamed out to battle in afternoon of May 5th supported by two gunboats, the recently captured Union gunboat CSS Bombshell and the CSS Cotton Plant. The Confederate &ldquo;Mosquito Fleet&rdquo; ran into a Union squadron of eight gunboats, five of them new &ldquo;double ender&rdquo; side wheel steamers designed as rams to attack Confederate ironclads. The resulting battle was a classic of strength vs. numbers. The Union ships held off the Confederates, but both sides were severely bloodied. Can you do as well or better than your historical counterpart?<br/><br/>Each copy of Thunder Upon the Water is composed of the following:<br/><br/>&bull;    One 11 by 17 inch hex map sheet.<br/>&bull;    One sheet of 142 single-sided, un-mounted counters<br/>&bull;    One Players&rsquo; Aid Sheet<br/>&bull;    One set of rules<br/><br/>Players use a standard deck of playing cards to activate their units and resolve some game events. Players also use six and ten sided dice (one of each). Each turn represents 15 minutes of time. Each hex is a little more than 200 yards across. Each unit represents 1 warship. The game is designed by Paul Rohrbaugh and features graphics by Bruce Yearian.<br/><br/>A supplemental card set for the game is also available. It replaces the standard deck of playing cards called for in the rules, feature graphics that compliment the game&rsquo;s, and has rules reminders on pertinent cards.<br/><br/>-description from designer<br/><br/>",

Expand your territory by building forts in uncontested lands or by capturing enemy forts. Develop your economy by exploiting natural resources and trading with minor nation ports. Invest in technology for long-term strategic advantages. Recruit an army and build a fleet to protect your empire&rsquo;s interests and conquer what is rightfully yours!<br/><br/>Begin the game by building a map out of the 20 unique land and 24 sea tiles which snap together for fast, stable assembly. Tiles feature 7 rare resources, which each provide a special bonus that will influence your strategy. This hex-based map will become the battlefield where you must position your armies tactically to threaten enemy forts while still defending your own. Battles involve revealing your army cards against your opponent&rsquo;s cards, and are resolved based entirely on the regiment composition and technological advantages &ndash; there are no dice or random draws, just imperfect information. Naval fleets provide strategic support to your armies, allowing you to quickly transport troops or even blockade your enemy&rsquo;s capital to try to starve their economy. Players are eliminated once their capital fort is conquered.<br/><br/>While Sovereignty is primarily a competitive strategy game, it also features a more story-driven campaign mode for solo/cooperative play. Become Napoleon in his campaign to conquer Europe (and with enough skill, the world). Engage in historic battles against an automated opponent, driven by behavior cards that react to your decisions. Each province you capture on the world map provides benefits for future battles, so you gain strength between each game you play.<br/><br/>Sovereignty was designed to be relative quick to learn, but difficult to master. The modular map, rare resources, and technology systems all result in a large diversity of strategies, so every game is unique. The artwork and thematic elements are all designed to provide an immersive experience, so you really can feel like you are building and growing an empire.<br/><br/>&mdash;description from the designer<br/><br/>",

Each player starts with a hand of six cards from a deck that contains cards numbered 2-11. One player starts by playing a single card or multiple cards with the same value, calling out the sum of the cards as it is played.<br/><br/>So if the player plays a 4 (or two 2s) he deals it to the center of the table and calls out &ldquo;4&rdquo;. The next player has to play a card (or cards of equal value added together) to surpass that sum or else collect all of the cards played so far.

Square pieces move orthogonally (rook move) and jump diagonally. Players are trying to get three pieces in a line, past their centre line.

Blue Wizards squash butterflies, Green Wizards heal butterflies, Orange Wizards Shield and protect butterflies and the Red Wizards counter spells.<br/><br/>On each player's they will draw 2 cards and then may play as many as one penguin type as they want, or pass to build up their hand. For a many penguins as the same type is played, that many Red penguins are needed to counter the spell, all or none. Players may combine their counters to stop a spell.

On player's turn they will have 4 actions points to move, and perform their actions such as, pick up cards, trade commodities, collect a commodity, collect gold, increase a value of a commodity or decrease the value of a commodity.<br/><br/>Each game will turn out and play differently. There is only so much of each commodity you will need to collect yours and other players goods. Each time a player collects another players commodity they collect one also. If someone manages to collect more of yours than you do, you may need to work to decrease the value of it. What becomes popular changes in every game.<br/>There is also gold in the game, and every time someone collects gold, it's value decreases and never can go back up.<br/><br/>Once a player has a million dollars worth of value, the game ends and everyone counts their total to see who wins.

All the damn it cards have my face( Joseph Roche or Joe) on them.<br/><br/>The game is a trick taking game. The first player plays a number and any amount of that number, the next player must if able play a higher number card, they can choose how many of that number they want to play, does not need to be the same amount as previous player. Players continue playing until no one is able to play a higher number, the last player to play a card takes the pot of cards. The numbers on the card are red or green, 2 of each from each number. Red cards a negative 1 point, and the green cards positive 1 point. Whoever gets the cards may or may not want them.<br/>This where the Damn Cards comes in, with a few other choice words tend to follow. Everyone starts with a &quot;Damn It Joe&quot; and &quot;Damn You Joe&quot; card. At any time during the hand or wait till the last number card is played, use their Damn It Joe card to end the round and choose who gets the cards. If it good give them to yourself, if bad send it to your enemy, but then if some one plays their Damn It Joe Card, any player can use their Damn You Joe card to trump the round and then they get to select a player to receive the cards. The Damn cards can only be used once per entire hand, so use them wisely.<br/>After all the number cards are played, players will count their total, high score wins the hand. If a player wins 2 hands in a row or 3 hands total, they win the game. The player who won the previous hand generally tends to get all the hate, and the cursing tend to increase, and it's hilarious.<br/><br/>&mdash;description from the publisher<br/><br/>",

Few months of development later, the game is amazing and ready to go.<br/><br/>This is an anti-worker placement game, the game plays as a worker placement game, but almost everything you do will help you and your opponents, with your opponents getting a better benefit than you. Don't worry they are dealing with the same situation, figuring out how to optimize every move to take make their score at the end of the game the highest.<br/><br/>Every time you play the game the game layout is different. For each player player there is an addition tile grid added, the grid system is mixed and laid out randomly each round of the game. No player can memorize best moves, because that will change every game. There is 3 round per game, each round depending on the amount of players and players playing speed, between 15 to 30 minutes.<br/><br/>This is a heavier strategy game, if you like games where every move is important and the wrong move can cost you dearly, then this is the game for you.<br/><br/>&mdash;description from the publisher<br/><br/>",

Every turn, you must choose how your crew spends their lives - installing new parts on your ship, working in those facilities to increase the Crew you have available, creating immortal Drones and innumerable Clones to take their place, or resting comfortably with ample time to raise the next generation.<br/><br/>As your ship approaches the planet, you must carefully balance the needs of your ship with the future needs of your colony. Once the planet is reached, the Crew you have in stasis on your ship will determine which among you can start the most successful colony. <br/>Humanity has a chance for a new start. You could lead what is left of us into a bright future on our new home.<br/><br/>Each game features a randomized sub-set of available Parts for you ship and Landing Sites that determine scoring. Every game will play differently. Bidding Fuel to outrace the other ships determines what Parts you can buy every turn, while Influence can be used to determine additional rules every ship must adhere to. Simultaneous turns keep the action moving and everyone engaged.<br/><br/>&mdash;description from the designer<br/><br/>",

Still, they're doing their best, and you'll pick the person who packs the best combination of items for you. Between you, you'll figure out What goes to Where.<br/><br/>What To Where!? is a hilarious party game of questions, answers, and storytelling.<br/><br/>The game is played in rounds - play one round or play 20, whatever you want. Each round, one player (called the Traveler) secretly takes a Destination card which indicates where they're going. The other players have a predetermined number of Question Actions denoted by chips, and in the center of the table a pile of Item Tiles, all unique. All at the same time, the players who are not the Traveler sift through the Items, trying to pick the very best set of four for the Traveler to take with them. Meanwhile, the players may cash in chips to ask limited Questions that will narrow down where the Traveler is going.<br/><br/>Once all of the Question Actions have been taken (all the chips spent), the Traveler reveals their Destination and all players reveal the Items they selected. Then everyone gets a chance to tell a story to justify why they picked what they did. The Traveler chooses who &quot;packed&quot; the set of items and declares that player the winner for the round.<br/><br/>&mdash;description from the publisher<br/><br/>",

It is a world of indentured peons and hardworking mules, traveling tinker bands and perspiring fixers bathed in furnace glow. Merchantmen anchor off far-flung ports while rank upon rank of Her Majesty's rifles assemble in faceless obedience. A darkened corner could turn up one of Turing's programmatic spies while, ensconced underground, seers break through into a kaleidoscope of forbidden futures. Here, there are dukes (one mad), princelings with dark pasts and kings and queens of uncertain allegiance. Overhead, her Highness's trusted fighting aces rule the skies; beneath, her elephantine automatons shake the very ground.<br/><br/>In this realm, the all-seeing, all-knowing tentacles of the Great Empress reach far and wide. So wide, in fact, that many have despaired of freedom and&mdash;at a glance of her one baleful eye&mdash;life itself. But there is hope: a tale overheard in the fevered ruminations of a nameless prophet speaks of a day when one of her subjects will approach the throne, wrench the cephalopodic scepter from her grasp and end the reign of terror. But who?<br/><br/>Welcome to Empress, a climbing game of cunning, strategy and power. The premise? Be the first to shed all of your cards and ascend the throne of the Great Empress. But beware&mdash;a tragic misstep and you could find yourself wallowing in drudgery as a Peon or Mule. Empress may be played with any number of players from 2 to 8 (add a second deck for 5 or more).<br/><br/>&mdash;description from the publisher<br/><br/>",

The FTCN (Federation of Time-Traveling Capable Nations) has voted that all nations must give up their time travel capabilities. A single task force of &ldquo;time editors&rdquo; (agents that specialize in changing the timeline) will be kept on standby in the event that they are needed to save humanity from any possible future disasters. Only the nation with the most skilled time editors will retain their use of time travel. The task force of time editors will be chosen through a &ldquo;time editing&rdquo; trial. The first nation to prevent four disastrous past events will retain the use of time travel and will have command of the official global task force of time editors.​<br/><br/>PLAY:<br/>The game is a blend of:<br/>&bull; resource and economy management<br/>&bull; a worker placement system in the present and past<br/>&bull; storytelling<br/><br/>To win the game you must prevent 4 disastrous events in the past from happening.<br/> Player mats have two halves - past and present. People and resources you take to the past can only be used in the past. People and resources you keep in the present can only be used in the present. Each player has 4 types of time editing specialists: Science, Technology, Military, and Politics. Specialists have unique abilities when they are in the present, but when they travel back in time to change the past you lose their abilities in the present.<br/><br/>You can send 1 to 4 specialists back in time if you have the necessary resources. Sending multiple, or all, at once will reduce the wormhole resources needed by reducing the number of time jumps (1 per turn). But keeping some specialists in the present will allow you to use their abilities to strengthen your economy, intelligence, and undermine other nations. Who and when you send where is your choice!<br/><br/>Each player is given unique disasters in the past that they will need to prevent. (There are 16 time lines with 80 unique events). In order to change the time line and prevent a disaster, you must change the events leading up to the disaster. Certain specialists are needed to change specific events but you can decide which event you travel to. Attempts at changing the time line involve storytelling (a game tester favorite!) and pulling tiles to create ripples through time.<br/><br/>In order to time travel and pay specialists to change the past, you will need an economy. There are over 130 possible economic setups with variable risk/reward factors. Players explore planets, build mining colonies, mine resources and transport them to Earth. Planets further from Earth have richer mining deposits but will take longer to reach (unless you can afford to create wormholes or pay to use other players&rsquo; wormholes).<br/><br/>Resources can only be used once they are returned to Earth, so you will need to plan ahead multiple turns for where/when your time ship will be and which specialists are where/when. Resources can be used to buy items for your economy, buy action cards (draw 3 &amp; choose 1), open wormholes in space (for faster travel to planets), open wormholes in time (to change the past), pay time editing specialists to change the past, or hire A. I. to give you the probability of causing a time ripple.<br/><br/>&mdash;description from the publisher<br/><br/>",

        "description": "5 Different Boomtown Baseball Games<br/><br/>Free! Dr. Scratchov Scratcher!<br/><br/>disposable games to scratch, play &amp; throw away<br/><br/>OBJECTIVE:  The Boomtown &quot;Bats&quot; are hosting their archrivals, The Mudville &quot;Muggers&quot;, in another classic confrontation at famous Boomtown Stadium!  It's the top of the ninth,  Neither team has scored.  Who will win this critical game?<br/><br/>PREPARATION:  Choose your team.  The teams bat with a lineup of four batters picked at random from their full team of nine.  A batter's lifetime &quot;stats&quot; are shown below his name.  The batting order starts at the top (near the pitch indicators) and is repeated if necessary by returning to #1 as the fifth batter.  Keep track of all base runner with pennies placed on the baseball diamond.  The &quot;Muggers&quot; bat first.<br/><br/>HOW TO PLAY:  The pitcher throws each ball by placing his finger tip on the pitch of his choice and announcing either &quot;fast ball&quot;, &quot;curve ball&quot;, or &quot;slider&quot;.  The other player then scratches any one of his four &quot;swing&quot; boxes&quot; under the pitch for the player he has at bat (if all a batter's swing boxes are scratched for one type of pitch, the pitcher must throw something else). It will reveal one of the following results:<br/><br/>HR (Home Run)  - It's a hit out of the park.  The batter and all runners score.<br/><br/>X (Strike) - Get 3 strikes and the batter is out.<br/><br/>W (Walk) - The batter advances to first base.<br/><br/>G (Grounder) - It's a hit.  The pitching team must play the ball.  The pitcher scratches any one of his ten &quot;Infield&quot; squares to see the results of the play.<br/><br/>FB (Fly Ball) - It's a  hit.  The pitching team must play the ball.  The pitcher scratches any one his ten &quot;Outfield&quot; squares to see the results of the play.<br/><br/>When and Grounder or Fly Ball is played by the pitcher the following things can result:<br/>S (Single) - The batter and all runners advance one base.<br/>D (Double) - The batter and all runners advance two bases.<br/>T (Triple) - The batter and all runners advance three bases.<br/>HR (Home Run) - The batter and all runners score.<br/>O (Out) - The batter is out.<br/>DP (Double Play) - The batter and the furthest advanced runner (if there is one) are out.  Scratch two out squares on the scoreboard.<br/><br/>Keep track of &quot;Runs&quot; and &quot;Outs&quot; by scratching the squares left to right on the score board.  After the &quot;Muggers&quot; have made three outs, the roles reverse and the &quot;Bats&quot; come up to the plate.  After the &quot;Bats&quot; have three outs, the game is over.  The team with the highest score wins.  In the event of a tie, play another card for &quot;extra innings&quot;.<br/><br/>SPECIAL HINT:  You will notice, after playing a few games, that each of the nine batters on each team always bats exactly the same way every time.  For example, Homer Bundy, the slugger Right Fielder for the &quot;Muggers&quot;, always hits a home run if you pitch him a fast ball.  The more you know about each batter, the better you can pick the right pitch or choose the right swing.  Fast ball pitches tent to either be hit hard or get a strike.  Sliders tend to produce grounders, and curve balls tend to produce a lot of fly balls and walks.<br/><br/>&mdash;user summary<br/><br/>",

        "description": "Co-op is part simulation, part send-up, of the unique experience that is living in a housing cooperative (&quot;co-op&quot; for short). For the unacquainted, living in a co-op is similar to sharing a house with roommates, but with a lot more structure... Members of a co-op typically share responsibilities such as cooking and cleaning, while house rules are established during meetings through direct democracy. Resources, such as food (esp. granola) and utilities, are usually purchased by and shared amongst the members. CO-OP was developed by two seasoned (with sriracha) members of a real housing cooperative, as an attempt to game-ify the fun and complexity of collective living.<br/><br/>In the game, each player represents a housemate in the same co-op. Players must take 1 &quot;action&quot; on each of their turns, the most basic of which are Cleaning and Slacking Off. When a player Slacks Off, they convert some of the house's Cleanliness into their own Free Time (duh!)---this Free Time can be spent to gain points that help win the game. When a player Cleans, they gain access to Karma (by their good deeds), or may influence the very mechanics of the game by trying to pass a House Rule. Karma and Rules are represented by their own decks of cards: the Karma Cards confer secret advantages that may be played at a later opportune moment, while Rules are drafted from a row of 5 cards that are publicly displayed to all players.<br/><br/>It's worth noting that CO-OP is NOT a &quot;cooperative game&quot; (there are individual winners), and there can be a lot to keep track of if you want to best the other players (grrr). However, the play experience is usually quite casual---this is largely due to the Karma Cards, which each have their own co-op-y theme, and require the player to perform a mini-activity in order to gain the card's benefits. Some activities simply encourage players to share their life experience, while others might ask them to sing a song or tell a joke... something different every time!  CO-OP is a blast with friends and family, and also a great way to break the ice with perfect strangers.<br/><br/>&mdash;description from the publisher<br/><br/>",

Only after 1261, in competition with the Genoese, did the Venetians organize the first commercial activities related to high-value cargo. Despite the difficulties in recruiting and commanding the crews, the connections with the Black Sea were essential for the Venetian economy in the period.<br/><br/>At Pontus Euxinus, players take on the role of traders sailing the difficult Black Sea, with all its challenges, to earn profits for their family and reputation for their home. Throughout the game, players will need to not only make the most of the goods they transport, but also build ports along the huge coastline, build cities and establish influence at various points.<br/><br/>The game works through an innovative system of data use in which each round the parameters change and the players need a good planning to face the difficulties.

        "description": "Few aircraft embodied &ldquo;the future&rdquo; like the F-104 Starfighter. The shining needle-like gleaming metal fuselage and pressure-suit clad crew evoke spaceships more than aircraft. Lockheed&rsquo;s legendary designer Kelly Johnson interviewed fighter crews during the Korean War and created a simple fighter that maximized performance. His team conceived of the smallest aircraft they could wrap around a powerful engine. The Starfighter served with many air forces around the globe, in roles from interceptor to nuclear bomber.<br/><br/>But reality was harsher than space age dreams. The F-104 gained its Missile With A Man In It nickname in an era when many spacecraft exploded in the first moments of flight. The Starfighter&rsquo;s cutting-edge design and all-for-performance approach led to a career marred by far too many losses of aircraft and life.<br/><br/>Missile With A Man In It contains every F-104 Starfighter combat variant, plus the proposed CL-1200 Lancer. The included opponents promise a wealth of Zipper-centric mayhem. Scenarios includes every known historic F-104 encounter, struggling over Hainan Island during the Vietnam War, battling between the two Chinas across the Formosa Strait, or soaring against the backdrop of the Himalayas in the Indo-Pakistani Wars.<br/><br/>Learn to fight the Starfighter from Killjoy, teaching players to employ the aircraft&rsquo;s unique &ldquo;double-attack&rdquo; fighting style. Explore the Starfighter&rsquo;s achievements in the USAF&rsquo;s Operation Feather Duster evaluations, and about the Starfighter&rsquo;s infamous safety record, digging into the history, causes and myths.<br/><br/>",

There are only a few Overlords left and they are racing to build a Road to a Lost City of forgotten lore and restorative technology. The first player to complete a 20-30 space long Road and drive her Overlord to the end wins the game!<br/><br/>Each Player draws cards from the Road deck and lays down the cards in a line to form their Road. Simple Pavement cards extend the Road. Installation cards give you many more options: Farms allow you to create more workers. Refineries create the Fuel that you must pay to build each part of your Road and to compete in the Auction phase. Fortresses allow you to attack your rivals' Roads with withering Barrages or daring and potentially lucrative Raids. Once the Card is added to the Road, Players crew their installations by placing Peds in the spaces on each card. Players then go through the breeding, refining, and attacking phases and end their turn with the option of selling any cards they don't use.<br/><br/>During every phase of a Player's turn, the Overlord figure has a special ability that can be used to augment the action, such as drawing more cards, motivating installations to act again, directly attacking rival Roads, and more. But each Overlord Action costs fuel from the Overlord's reserve and Players must make good choices about when to use these additional abilities.<br/>After each round of turns, Players move to Walkerville, a neutral territory where upgrades, special power cards, more workers, and various unique actions are sold in blind auctions. If two or more players compete for a single auction item and reach the maximum bid, the issue is decided by a frantic, high-stakes Drag Race. Auction wins can dramatically turn the tide of the game and Players are encouraged to bid aggressively.<br/><br/>&mdash;description from the designer<br/><br/>",

        "description": "Gravity Falls: Quest for the Ultimate Summer Adventure is a fan-made adaptation of the Disney series Gravity Falls: The now-13 year-old Pines twins return to Gravity Falls with dreams of having another amazing summer adventure with their friends, but it's not starting out to be much of an adventure. Waddles has been banned from the bus system and had to stay behind in Piedmont, Stan and Ford are both off on their own adventures in parts unknown and Wendy got a new job outside of town! Tourism is way down and business is not good at the Mystery Shack so far either. Soos has been nice enough to let Dipper and Mabel stay in the Mystery Shack attic again as his guests, but what's the point? It starts to seem like the twins aren't going to re-live another 'amazing summer' after all... that is until Candy, Grenda, Pacifica, and Gideon pay a surprise visit to the twins. They tell the twins tales of new strange things going on in town and how the four of them have been out adventuring every day and are now on a quest to get to the bottom of all this new weirdness. For Mabel and Dipper, nothing sounds better than a Quest for the Ultimate Summer Adventure in Gravity Falls!<br/><br/>Players assume the role of one or more of the Gravity Falls characters: Dipper, Mabel, Candy, Grenda, Pacifica, or Gideon. Each character has unique abilities and each can be &quot;leveled-up&quot; to further expand their uniqueness. Players take turns moving their character(s) on the game board, which is a representation of the Gravity Falls townsite and surrounding area. On each board space a player may choose to stop and perform an action, such as visiting local shops to purchase equipment, supplies, or items to use as weapons, or they may &quot;Search&quot; their current location. Searching requires players to draw a card from the Search Deck, which contains random events, Foes, and item cards.<br/><br/>Encounters with enemies (Foes) requires that characters first make a &quot;Fear Test&quot;, pitting their own &quot;Weirdness&quot; against their newly-encountered Foe. The game also employs a &quot;Fear Tracker&quot; which has increasing threat levels indicating how frightened the characters are at the moment. When the Fear level is low, creatures like a Gremgoblin or Giant Fruit Bat may not seem so scary at all. But, as the Fear level increases, it is possible that even encountering cute critters like Fairies, Beavers or a Snake-Badger (or is it a Snadger?) may be terrifying causing characters to initially flee before they are willing to re-consider engaging in battle.<br/><br/>Games may be played using a fully randomized game board and Search deck, or players may use the Quest book that is included with the rules to play through a story-driven series of increasingly difficult Quests to discover what is behind these strange goings-on in Gravity Falls. For each of these Quests that are completed the players may draw a single Treasure card, which is often a rare or unique item that they can keep or trade in to the Mystery Shack in exchange for in-game bonuses or perks.<br/><br/>&mdash;description from the publisher<br/><br/>",

The configuration of these powers, represented by the colored rings, is updated throughout the game - players can change the position of one ring as part of each move, placing up to 3 rings on any figure. When more rings of different colors are placed on a figure the powers combine.<br/>The objective is to capture both of your opponent's golden rings.<br/><br/>&mdash;description from the designer<br/><br/>",

        "description": "Star Thieves is a science fiction heist board game, first developed and released in 2013.<br/><br/>Set in the year 2595, aboard a futuristic space station - physically represented by a medium-sized hexagonal board - up to eight players are directed to navigate towards the crux of the game, the Black Star Diamond, located at the center. Players are dealt a small hand of cards that are categorized as &quot;Equipment&quot;, &quot;Action&quot; and &quot;PvP&quot; - the last of which is inaccessible throughout this first phase called &quot;Heist Mode&quot;. During this time, players must overcome obstacles, including doors and turrets, while also accounting for treachery dealt by their opponents.<br/><br/>Once the Black Star Diamond has been snatched, the board resets into &quot;PvP Mode&quot;, which allows for players to utilize their generally lethal PvP cards, to pursue the jewel's carrier. The player to return to their starting hexagon dubbed the &quot;Spawn Point&quot; wins the game.<br/><br/>Designed by Samuel Horton, Tobias Phelps and Ryan Brock, the game was intended to emulate the tone of a multiplayer online battle arena (MOBA) - a video game - title, with heist being the central mechanic. The game was inspired predominantly by Dota 2, Scrolls, Pathfinder Roleplaying Game (1st Edition) and Gloom.<br/><br/>In 2019, American film &amp; video game developer Botto Entertainment acquired the intellectual property rights to Star Thieves.<br/><br/>&mdash;description from the designer<br/><br/>",

        "description": "A Hybrid Fantasy Civilization RPG that plays 1-10 players. This game bridges the legacy board games with Table Top Role Playing Games.  Using magnetic pieces on a globe that acts as a new form of game board; Verrago is the first of it's kind.  You play on the planet Vaeya, as any kind of political unit(character, family, kingdom, empire, global civilization)on a world where everything hangs in a Veridian Balance.  Should this balance be disrupted by you and your fellow players(and it surely will), the planet will try to end your evil ways by uniquely trying to exterminate everyone, starting with the worst perpetrators. This is a world where nothing stays the same, mysteries deepen as you explore the Veridian and attempt to master it and you can choose to band together to fight the apocalypse or become it.<br/>With 5 main paths to victory(Epic Story, Strongest Lineage, Veridian Imprint, Strategic Survivor and Richest Delve) you choose how and where your victories can occur over your opponents.  Victories, over many plays of Verrago, create a historical record of your globe that becomes unique to your gaming group. The globe itself acts as your &quot;save file&quot; so that your playthrough's matter, your time playing the game works more for you. This allows you to create a long term dialogue with your board game group and weave ever more elaborate stories that add value to your group and add additional meaning to your friendships<br/><br/>Dungeon Masters, this game will help you relieve your creative burdens and allow you to get immediate player investment into your game when doing your session zero game!  Verrago uses a co-created history mechanic for telling epic, memorable stories that can also be used for your Table Top Role Playing Games(TTRPG)! Vaeya, the planet of our setting, is an INTERACTIVE SETTING, the cards allow for a dynamic storytelling experience that also gives you(and your characters) direct control over a range of theme/lore heavy game mechanics.  Verrago also has an event system that helps you generate a world spanning, geopolitical and Veridian situation EACH GAME, with care to minimize the burdens of recording the history during the game.  A more detailed record is possible, yet this will be at your own discretion.  Verrago also has a Campaign Book that works with the card generation system so that you get the best of both worlds, the strength of linear storytelling AND the strength of the &quot;choose your own adventure&quot; style of storytelling. There is nothing that approaches the scope and scale of Verrago on the board game market.  There's something special about creating a world with others...<br/><br/>The game has 3 main parts, of which the first is optional and the third won't always occur.  Here is a rough overview of how it will play(subject to change as the game is currently in development):<br/><br/>1. The Pre-Game(Optional): You play with your friends to set the precise magical conditions you want to play and feel out and fine tune the game so that you aren't limited to randomization. This pre-game is about generating the world you will play next and takes about 30-60min.  There are 25 preset scenarios that allow you to skip this pre-game and are recommended for your first few times playing the game.<br/><br/>2. Verrago: You will Explore, Expand, Exploit, Experiment and Exterminate your opponents, sometimes needing to create temporary/permanent alliances to survive the more dangerous events that occur randomly(or by player action).  As you acquire power in the world, the planet fights back as you are disrupting the careful magical balance of the world.  <br/>Once you've disrupted the balance enough, through your own actions or that of the planetary response, the apocalypse will begin.<br/>  <br/>3. Sudden Death Apocalypse: Featuring 125 different ways to destroy the world, each apocalypse will demonstrate something new about Veridian and the world.  The Apocalypse has 5 randomly drawn event cards at the beginning of the game that slowly get turned over revealing the apocalypse code that players look up in the event book.  Players take their most empowered character(s), their Verrago, and attempt to maneuver them so that the apocalypse affects other players more than themselves.  Whatever remains is yours to keep for the next game.  At the end of the apocalypse, the game will be recorded using pen and paper and you can choose to continue your play and build upon the remains of the previous age. You win when you survive and no one else does, or you survive better than everyone else.  You can also win by creating the strongest legacy and other forms of victory.  Victory is more of a long term goal, with challenges like &quot;survive the 25 preset scenarios in different configurations&quot;.<br/><br/>Verrago is a multi-layered game, with 5 expansions already designed to work with the existing game, so that you will only ever need to purchase 1 globe to play it.  Each expansion will provide the scope of a full game, using cards and add an in depth focus to the game, changing it into many different forms of popular game mechanics like: Warfare, Trade, Technology, More Veridian(Magic), Culture, and Survival/CO-OP. The game is designed to fundamentally change into your preferred style of game by purchasing an expansion.  Or play all expansions together, they are interchangeable and don't have dependencies on each other.  Future expansions WILL have dependencies on the core expansions. Bring whichever expansion you like to the table to try to shift the focus of the game &quot;your&quot; way as you unlock the option to play your expansion by your in game actions.<br/><br/>About this project and the designer:<br/><br/>This unique Role Playing Game(RPG) setting has undergone rigorous craft, research and extreme care in it's composition as a passion project beginning in 2003. S.A. Heinichen was trained at Navy Nuclear Power Training Command and then at Submarine Base Groton in the U.S. Navy, in addition to having held a Top Secret security clearance.  S.A. Heinichen's extensive training in multiple applied engineering fields has allowed him to incorporate many scientific disciplines into the magic system, represented simply by the rune system.  The Cloak and Dagger excitement of the intelligence community is a theme throughout Verrago.  Verrago strikes a balance between science fiction and high fantasy and you can actively change this balance during the course of the game as part of your strategic storytelling goals.<br/><br/>&mdash;description from the designer<br/><br/>",

Take your band on tour where you wager fan cards and fight it out with your battle deck in a winner takes all competition. Be the last band standing and become a ROCK LEGEND.<br/><br/>The core game includes:<br/>More Than 250 Cards<br/>Over 150 Custom Illustrations<br/>Casino-quality Cardstock<br/><br/>There is no wrong way to build your band!<br/><br/>How the game is played:<br/><br/>The game is comprised of 4 phases.  The BAND PHASE, TOUR PHASE, BATTLE PHASE, and MOP UP PHASE. During the BAND PHASE, you're dealt cards from the Band Deck. This deck comprises mostly of band members and gear. When all players have constructed their bands then starts the TOUR PHASE.  Cards from the Tour Deck are played until a venue card is played. Venue cards initiate the BATTLE ROUND. This is where each player receives cards from the Battle Deck and wagers their Fan Cards. All the players take turns playing cards to either increase your playlist points or decrease another player's points. After 3 cards are played by each player, points are tallied up and everybody moves on to the MOP UP PHASE. During this phase, all battle cards and band cards that were played during the battle round are cleaned up and the winner collects all the wagered Fan Cards. The BAND PHASE begins again and the cycle is repeated until either all Fan Cards belong to one player or the Tour Deck is depleted. Player with the most Fan Cards at the end of the game is crowned the winner!<br/><br/>",

        "description": "In Sugartown each player tries to be the first to match a sequence of cards in full view of other players. At the beginning of play a &quot;true story&quot; is created by the dealer. The true story is a sequence of suspect, crime, victim and location cards describing a crime in Sugartown.<br/><br/>Players draw cards in an attempt to match the sequence of cards in the true story. They can also play action cards that thwart another player's progress. Carefully time the placement of matches and be vigilant about watching the progress of opponents.<br/><br/>Action cards represent film noir inspired twists. An &quot;Interrogation&quot; card allows a player to steal, an &quot;Amnesia&quot; card allows a player to block an opponents progress, a &ldquo;Flashback&quot; card allows a player to remove Amnesia cards or reveal matching cards hidden from view. A &quot;Brainwash&quot; card wipes out a player's decks causing them to begin from scratch but can be reversed with a &quot;Turn the Tables&quot; card.<br/><br/>Game play varies from 15 to 30 minutes. Rules can be learned quickly and there are 100s of possible storylines, each using colorful characters, crimes and locales inspired by detective/gangster films and candy!<br/><br/>",

ZomPie is a quick paced card drafting game that is fun for the entire family. Be the first to collect your ingredients and make your ZomPie before you can be eaten by the Zombies.<br/><br/>For 2 to 8 players ages 6 and up. Game setup is simple as each player is dealt 1 of 8 unique recipe cards, such as: Squished Eyeball Crumble, Pustule Pie, Crusty Scab Pie and others. Each recipe card lists the 5 ingredients that you need for your ZomPie recipe. Next, each player is dealt 5 ingredient cards. The ingredients are not for the faint at heart and are only appetizing to the zombie horde with favorites like: Toe Nails, Putrid Arms, Ear Wax, Jellied Bile or Canned Farts.<br/><br/>Game Play is just as easy, each player attempts to collect all recipe ingredients for their ZomPie as game play progresses through card draw and discard. Players draw new ingredient cards from the pile and discard unwanted ingredient cards from their hand to maintain 5 ingredient cards at all times.  But watch out, because Zombies are at every turn with NomNom and NomNomNom cards with the likes of: &ldquo;A strong wind blew away your opened can of farts&rdquo; or &ldquo;A Zombie clown juggles your ingredients and drops a few&rdquo;, these can cause you to discard, trade or pass your pie ingredient cards or even, lose a turn!<br/><br/>The first player to collect all 5 ingredients needed for their ZomPie recipe wins that round. Once someone completes their ZomPie, all recipe and ingredient cards are collected and redealt and the first person to win 3 rounds (or as many, or few rounds as everyone wants to play) wins the game&hellip; all other players are fed to the Zombie Horde (or maybe they just lose). So, stay off the menu and live to play another day!<br/><br/>&mdash;description from the publisher<br/><br/>",

They will subtract points from your total score.<br/><br/>Collect the Loot Cards and pass the Cursed Cards on to other players and win!<br/><br/>Game Play:<br/>2 players: 20 rounds, keep all cards in game, reshuffle Discovery Cards when all are used.<br/>3 players: 13 rounds, remove 1 standard Loot card, reshuffle Discovery Cards when all used.<br/>4 players: 10 rounds, keep all cards in game, reshuffle Discovery Cards if needed.<br/> Items needed to play not included: pencil and paper to keep track of player scores.<br/><br/>Getting Started: Prepare Loot and Color Card Decks based on number of players. Keep cards types separate and shuffle each deck thoroughly.<br/> Stack the Loot and Discovery Decks in center of play area next to each other and within easy reach of all players.<br/> Being Play: The youngest player starts by drawing three cards from the Loot Deck and places them face up on the table in front of them. Then, going clockwise around the table, each player also draws three Loot Cards and places them face up in front of them on the table.  This is done so everyone can see who drew what from the Loot Deck.<br/><br/>The youngest player starts the Game Round by turning over one Discovery Card and placing it face up on the table next to the Discovery Deck.<br/> Each player must then stash into their personal stash pile one Loot Card that color code matches the Discovery Card that was overturned.<br/> If a player does not have a Loot Card that color matches the Discovery Card displayed, they must discard the lowest point rated card in their hand into the stash pile.<br/> <br/>            Cursed Loot Cards are also color coded Blue, Yellow, Green, and Wild, and must be discarded if that is the <br/>        <br/>    <br/><br/><br/>only card in the player&rsquo;s hand that matches the displayed Discovery Card.  Cursed Loot will subtract points!<br/> Once each player has stashed one of their loot cards into their own stash pile (this is how you gain or lose points), they then choose one card from their hand to pass to the person of their left. Players cannot pass in the same round a card that was given them by another player in that same round.<br/><br/>Once each player has stashed one card and passed one card, they should have one card left on display.  They then draw two more cards from the top of the Loot Deck.<br/> Once each players again has three cards on display the current game round ends and the next round begins with a new Discovery Card being overturned.<br/><br/>Wild Cards: Any Loot card can be stashed when the Wild Discovery Card is displayed, unless a player is holding the Cursed Wild Card, which must then always be stashed.  It is possible for the Cursed Wild Card to be in game play until the last round &mdash; players beware!<br/><br/>Ending A Game:  When no more cards can be drawn each player should have one card left before them. That last card is added to their stash pile. If their last Loot Card color matches the last Discovery Card players can add an extra 50 bonus points to their total score.<br/> Scoring: Each player adds up their total Loot Points and the end game bonus point if it applies, then subtracts any Cursed Loot Points to get their total score.  High Score Wins!<br/><br/>&mdash;description from the publisher<br/><br/>",

        "description": "Welcome to the The Pie Game card game! Grandma needs your help, she signed up for the local bake sale to make one of her award-winning pies, but her bursitis is acting up and this is preventing her from making her pie. Can you help Grandma make the pie and save the day or will you disgrace Grandma by not getting your pie made?<br/><br/>For 2 to 8 players ages 6 and up. Game setup is simple as each player is dealt 1 of 8 unique recipe cards, such as: Apple Pie, Chocolate Cream Pie, Key Lime and others. Each recipe card lists the 5 ingredients that you need for your pie recipe. Next, each player is dealt 5 ingredient cards. The ingredients are all fresh and delicious with favorites like: Whipped Cream, Lime Juice, Chocolate Cookie Crust, Brown Sugar and Milk.<br/><br/>Game Play is just as easy, each player attempts to collect all recipe ingredients for their Pie as game play progresses through card draw and discard. Players draw new ingredient cards from the pile and discard unwanted ingredient cards from their hand to maintain 5 ingredient cards at all times. But watch out, because three could be trouble at every turn with Fudge and Double Fudge cards with the likes of: &ldquo;Your neighbor wants to borrow some eggs&rdquo; or &ldquo;The cat knocked the sugar bowl off the counter&rdquo;, these can cause you to discard, trade or pass your pie ingredient cards or even, lose a turn!<br/><br/>The first player to collect all 5 ingredients needed for their Pie recipe wins that round. Once someone completes their Pie, all recipe and ingredient cards are collected and redealt and the first person to win 3 rounds (or as many, or few rounds as everyone wants to play) wins the game&hellip; all other players have to disappoint Grandma and tell her they did not get their pie done (or maybe they just lose). So, don&rsquo;t let Grandma down!<br/><br/>&mdash;description from the publisher<br/><br/>",

Players will draw rewards from common, uncommon, rare, and legendary decks, as well as a pile of Monies coins.<br/><br/>Once the entire beach has been dug up, players count the value of their treasure cards and Monies coins, add endgame bonuses to their score, and the player with the most Monies wins.<br/><br/>-description from designer<br/><br/>",

Players on a team cooperate. Teams may choose to cooperate and negotiate, and assist customers (semi-cooperative) leading to lively group discussion and dynamics. The game uses simple math and card melds to determine who successfully assists customers.<br/><br/>There are three mutually-exclusive competing objectives: 1. to develop your team's deck, 2. to develop individual player's venture and 3. to score customers.

A terrible beast is slaying scores of innocents, and particularly relishes in targeting young women and children. On New Year&rsquo;s Eve, 1764, the Bishop of Mende proclaims the Beast a scourge sent by God to punish the people for their wicked ways. The people are commanded<br/>to pray and repent, but this only serves to increase terror across the region and stoke the flames of superstition.  and organize an effective response to the situation. The story of The Beast is immediately spun into one of the first sensationalized and most influential media crazes. Captivating imaginations across France, Europe and beyond, the rising number of &ldquo;unnatural deaths&rdquo; increases the demand for publications such as the Courrier d&rsquo;Avignon. All the while the beast remains unchecked.<br/><br/>Players enter the scene in January 1765, where they take on the role of hunters in pursuit of the Beast. Some have come for holy reasons, believing they combat the Devil&rsquo;s manifestations on Earth. Others are driven by altruistic motives, hoping to save more innocents from being slaughtered by the menace. There are<br/>those with less honorable reasons too, obsessed with seeking fame and fortune in slaying the Beast. And a diabolical few have more sinister motives, hoping to use the events as a smokescreen for their own personal vendettas and dark deeds. Veteran hunters also flock to the area just for sport, as this is a hunt for the ages! If they hope to succeed, players will need to curry favor with one of the four estates, through whose generosity they will gain superiority on the hunt. And with luck on their side, they might finally bring an end to The Beast of G&eacute;vaudan&rsquo;s reign of terror!<br/><br/>The game themes  and mechanics revolve  around the following:<br/><br/>the Mystery of the Beast: A Novel Mechanic where the Nature of the Beast can be one of 24 options, which players try to discover during the game to prepare for the Final Hunt!<br/><br/>Spinning Narratives: Dealing with the Four Estates and secret patrons to spin the public opinion of what the Nature of the Beast is&hellip; and gain Influence above your rivals!<br/><br/>Deception and Secret Agendas: There are numerous ways to gain the most Influence and win the game&hellip; tactics and strategy are key to being triumphant!<br/><br/>Psychological Trauma and Animal Companions: The use of Fear and Trauma mechanics to help players also appreciate the terror people faced in those dark times&hellip; and that one&rsquo;s faithful hound or trusty steed was all the treatment that existed back then!<br/><br/>&mdash;description from the designer<br/><br/>",

        "description": "So after much pain, sweat and toil, Hammer of Democracy is available.<br/><br/>If you aren&rsquo;t familiar with our Hammer series of games, it&rsquo;s a relatively rules-light game for low-level ww2 action, aiming to play very quickly and with minimal rules look-up.<br/><br/>A typical game ranges from a reinforced platoon up to a company or more and plays in a very small span of time, combining pretty simple mechanics with surprisingly deep tactical play.<br/><br/>The game is welcoming of open-ended play where target numbers are set by consensus or a GM, as well as offering a more traditional &ldquo;fixed&rdquo; approach with modifiers and tactical factors.<br/><br/>As always, we offer suggestions for campaign play, a scenario generator and a points system.<br/><br/>You also get profiles for the more common fighting vehicles and anti-tank guns of the war, complete with the formula to calculate your own points values if you need.<br/><br/>This also means if you disagree with our factors, you can adjust them as you see fit.<br/><br/>If you want to play a simple pick-up game, you can generate an overall battle situation and either roll up random forces to play with, bring an army built to a pre-determined points total or any other option you want to employ.<br/><br/>A key innovation of Hammer of Democracy is the Support system, tying in things like off-map fire and using weapons such as machine guns and anti-tank guns in a way that feels truly combined arms, while forcing hard choices on the player.<br/><br/>Playtesters have been pretty universally excited about this system and I think you&rsquo;ll find it really cool.<br/><br/>Lastly of course we offer a tool box of rules for things like radio problems, fighting in the snow and dealing with civilians, as well as troop traits for commando&rsquo;s, die-hards and even special hero characters if you like your gaming a bit more pulp.<br/><br/>Whether you are already a fan of games like Squad Hammer and Trench Hammer or brand new to the concept, I hope you&rsquo;ll give us a chance to win you over.<br/><br/>The core mechanics are shared between Trench Hammer and Hammer of Democracy so that should give you a pretty good idea of what you are in for.<br/><br/>Basic factors<br/><br/>     All dice used are plain D6&rsquo;s with most rolls made using 2D6.<br/>     There are no &lsquo;Bucket of dice&rsquo; mechanics in play.<br/>     Turn sequence is IGOUGO with reaction options. <br/>     Game turns are very fast, most being resolved in 5 minutes or so.<br/>     Basic elements are squads/sections of infantry or single vehicles.<br/>     Infantry can be based on team stands or individually. <br/>     The rules are nominally intended for 15mm figures but has been tested with anything from 6mm to 1/72 scale.<br/><br/><br/>&mdash;description from publisher<br/><br/>",

Then he throws away the axe and clutches his sword and fights with it, and shields himself with his shield. They attack him bravely, but he kept them off like a man...<br/><br/>- The Saga of Gisli Sursson<br/><br/>The world of the sagas is a world of proud and irascible men with touchy tempers and big axes, and how their bad manners as tourists are matched by an astonishing inability to get along with the neighbors. It&rsquo;s like the Wild West, without the schoolmarm and the preacher, held on a cold windy coastline.<br/><br/>It's about blood-feuds, and raids, and quarrels, and blood-feuds, and stealing other people's stuff and taking one another to the rowdiest courts in the world, and blood-feuds, and being exiled to the far-flung reaches of the world and behaving just as badly there. It's about visiting other lands, meeting interesting people, and hacking them about with ironmongery and looting churches because that's where the gold and silver are kept. It's about you, me, Onund the dog-faced and his foster father Sven going over to see the farmer across the river to tell him exactly what we think of him.<br/><br/>Personal combat in the Norse sagas is notable for its combination of grim humor, gymnastic violence and a graphic interest in the details of wounds, especially those with fatal consequences. <br/>Battle-Troll is all about that, a fast, bloodthirsty game simple enough to play after several horns of mead. Stolen mead, from a looted monastery.<br/><br/>Also available: Battle Troll Action Deck: 52 cards - 4 sets of player turn cards; two End of Turn cards; and two complete Combat decks, with Attack and Defense strategies and card-sized Combat Results table.<br/><br/>&mdash;description from the publisher<br/><br/>",

If a picture is incorrectly guessed, the Artist and the person who guessed lose points instead. The Kicker? The Artists must not pick up the marker once they start drawing!

Can they trust you? I don't know, but I'm pickin' up some strange vibes. Could be that tuna I ate earlier...&quot;<br/><br/>Nuke? the Card Game puts players in the hot-seat as billionaires and world leaders with two simple goals: 1) to make more many than they ever did, 2) to not get blowed up.<br/><br/>You will be embodying a richer you, and over the course of 3 rounds, collecting sets of commodities to ensure a profitable asset portfolio. How will you accomplish this? Through trade negotiations of course! In real-time, you and your friends will be making deals as shrewdly as possible, but it's in the follow through that your true colours will show. Should you deal honestly and fulfill your end of the bargain? Or should you forsake your responsibility and send the all-dreaded nuke? See, here's the trick: all of the cards that are traded remain hidden until the end of the round. And then, just when you think you're all set to make a fat stack of dough... you flip your cards to reveal 3 nukes! Thanks guys, thanks a lot.<br/><br/>To add a little more chaos into the mix you'll receive a secret identity, and in the second round you'll get 2, and in the third round, 3. Talk about split personalities... These Identity cards might give you a scoring bonus or even a powerful single-use ability to whap out at the most opportune time. Pretty neat! Now it's time for you to put your power of persuasion to the test. But even for the shrewdest shark, at the end of the day the only question that remains is this: should you be a stable and trustworthy friend, or should you send a Nuke?<br/><br/>&mdash;description from the designer<br/><br/>",

All you need to do to win is avoid being the player last to hold the Poo Card!<br/><br/>Game Play Instructions:  Don&rsquo;t get stuck holding the Poo!  Flush it, use the plunger, trick a fellow player into taking it off your hands... Keep it far away!<br/><br/>Getting Started: Shuffle the deck and deal out all cards. Some players may have an extra card compared to other players. That&rsquo;s okay! Look at the cards you were dealt. If you have any two matching food card pairs discard them into a discard pile.   ***If you have three of the same cards, you discard two (one pair). If you have four of the same cards you can discard all four (two pair).<br/><br/>Don&rsquo;t let any players see your cards that are not able to be discarded!  Keep them secret!<br/><br/>After all players have discarded matching pairs, the youngest player goes first by drawing a single random card from the player on their right. Any new matching food card pairs, if a matching card was drawn, gets discarded right away and then the player on the right does the same, going around the table allowing each player to draw one card and discard pairs if able.<br/><br/><br/>            Anytime two food cards match they should be discarded. <br/>        <br/>    <br/><br/><br/>The Plunger Card: If you have a Plunger Card you can play it at the beginning of your turn or at the very end of your turn. When you play a Plunger Card it gets discarded immediately and is removed from the game. Playing the Plunger Card switches the direction players draw cards from. If the table had been drawing cards from the player on their right, they would now switch to drawing cards from the player on their left. Anytime a Plunger Card is played the direction changes. There are only four Plunger Cards in the deck.<br/><br/>The Toilet Card: The Toilet Card never gets discarded, but can switch from player to player if randomly drawn. Whenever you have the Toilet Card and the Poo Card in your hand you can flush the Poo Card by giving it to any player of your choice. When flushing the Poo you have to show everybody you have the toilet card. You keep the Toilet Card in your hand after flushing the poo, as it could be drawn by the player drawing cards from you on their next turn.<br/><br/>The Poo Card:  If you are left with no food cards in your hand and don&rsquo;t have the Toilet Card, but are holding the Poo Card, you lose the game. OH POO!<br/><br/>Anytime you discard all your food cards and have no other cards in your hand during your turn, you are &lsquo;out&rsquo; and can sit back and watch the remaining players struggle to avoid being stuck with the Poo Card.<br/><br/>&mdash;description from the publisher<br/><br/>",

A good-for-nothing of the worst kind! <br/>So naturally you are keen on fat prey... Aye? <br/>How about a legendary emerald, as clear and pure as a mountain stream and as big and heavy as the thick skull of an old drunkard?<br/><br/>The enchanted gem stone &bdquo;ALLWATYAWANT&ldquo;. <br/>Legend has it that this gem is supposed to fulfil every wish. <br/>Tempting - isn&acute;t it? Of course it is!<br/>The aim of the game is to rip this treasure under your dirty nails before someone else does. There&lsquo;s only the one or the other catch. On the one hand you still are on the wrong island and unfortunately you have to find a treasure map here first, on the other hand you have to collect 5 different building materials for a  proper raft in order to travel to the treasure island. However, the island won&acute;t reveal neither the treasure map nor resources voluntarily. You will have to explore the island and find what you need or &ldquo;acquire&ldquo; it otherwise. You will, good or bad, find much more than you like. The island holds innumerable dangers and adventures for you, which have to be conquered in order to leave the island. It goes without saying that also the deeps of the sea are pretty demanding too. Basically you could bathe in adventures. <br/>Apart from that... You are not the only scoundrel who is after the treasure and you will have to deal with your opponents in many different ways. You better leave moral considerations to the landlubbers.... Aye!!!????<br/><br/>&mdash;description from the designer<br/><br/>",

        "description": "Have you ever been watching soccer and thought man, this is boring!   I wish these humans were vehicles.  Like a tank, a train, a spaceship and even a boat.<br/><br/>Vehicular Arrangers does exactly that.  Using the basic principles of soccer and some interesting physics, players try to score on the opposing player's goal, just like soccer.  <br/>If you ever wondered what would happen when a sailboat meets a tank on a soccer field, you&rsquo;re in luck.  Spoiler alert! The tank flatters the sailboat!  Each vehicle has a special move that ensures even more mayhem on the field.<br/><br/>Vehicular Arrangers is a two-player card game that simulates vehicles playing soccer.  The game is played by making simultaneous decisions on each turn.  Those decisions direct players&rsquo; vehicles across a hex grid field.  Some of these decisions will cause vehicles to spin out and crash; others will allow a vehicle to score a goal.  A player wins when they score the most goals before the decks run out of cards.  If tied, players reshuffle, sudden death starts, and the next goal wins.<br/><br/>The game is played in rounds.  Players simultaneously assign cards to their vehicles behind a screen and once everyone is ready, they reveal them.  Then they execute the actions of their cards in initiative order among all players. Vehicles will bump other vehicles, vehicles will dribble and kick the ball, and things will lob into the air over other and into other things.<br/><br/>There are 4 special cards in each player deck that embrace the special properties of each vehicle. Tanks crush other vehicles.  Trains can drag objects behind them.  Spaceships can teleport.  Boats can pull objects to them.<br/><br/>&mdash;description from the designer<br/><br/>",

Some ships that were so shadowy in detail to border as myths have been documented and detailed and made worthy of hitting the game table. When coupled with the explosion in the availability of gaming models in both 1/600 and 1/1200, it is clear that Anaconda required an expanded points list.<br/>Yes, the game includes the basic calculations that allow gamers to generate the point values, but hey &ndash; here at Blue Water Designs, we got your back!<br/><br/>This is an expansion of the point lists within Anaconda.

When Love has matured and, through a dissolution of the self into light, become a radiance, then shall the Lover be liberated from dependence upon the Beloved, and the Beloved also be made perfect by being liberated from the Lover.&quot; ― Dag Hammarskj&ouml;ld (second UN Secretary-General, 1953-1961), Markings<br/><br/>United Nations: a world-oneness-family is cooperative game about love and service, a game with a voting, worker placement and crisis management, where players will take on the role of high UN officials and UN affiliated agencies in a quest for world peace and harmony. The goal of the game is to present historical events while at the same time giving the players an active role in avoiding crisis and promoting peace in all its manifestations.<br/><br/>At every moment the game's four natures of world tension, military, economic, social and diplomatic, is increasing. Every United Nations Secretary-General's mandate is interspersed with challenges such as the Cold War, Suez Canal, Ebola outbreaks and dictatorships. But great events also lighten and brighten the welkin of the world's hopes and promises - Gorbachev and the Fall of the Berlin Wall, smallpox is eradicated, UN-supervised elections install a president elected by the people.<br/><br/>Every mandate (round) players will inspire nations to vote and adopt resolutions in both the General Assembly and the Security Council. Each adopted resolution, in turn, will make available powers for UN agents and local governments to address their tensions of greater concern at the time. Tensions not addressed (by lack of time, manpower, resources or positive intention in the voting sessions) might erupt into crisis with the flow of the regional tension deck. A crisis will affect not only the originating region, but its neighbours as well.<br/><br/>Play continues for one round for each of the eight UNSG mandates. Players lose if 10 crisis happen but, as in life, the real goal of the game is to reach the highest possible score by working together for progress, and not just to avoid crisis. The UN stands for the high ideals and hopes of the world's people, so players have to strive to reach the UN agendas for the continuous progress of the world as a oneness-family. Players win if they do not lose for having ten crisis, establish at least seven of the eight possible UN regional offices. Then they score points for each resolution adopted, for each UN regional office they can establish, and lose points for every crisis that happens. On your next game, try to serve better and get a higher score!<br/><br/>&quot;I feel that there shall come a time in the near future when the entire world will be inundated with peace and this world of ours will become a oneness-world-family-home.&quot; -Sri Chinmoy, Lifting up the world with a oneness-heart, Agni Press, 1988<br/><br/>&mdash;description from the designer<br/><br/>",

        "description": "RULES<br/>You're minding your own business but a fight breaks out, so you take cover, but the bar brawl grows and you get pulled in, evading some punches, but with little else to do, you fight back! Start by rolling one die for target number 1 (Take Cover), which is a 2 die roll target. If you hit the 2 put a 1 in the box, if you stop without hitting the 2 give yourself a -1 for each number off, so if you stayed with a 4, you would give yourself a -2 in the box. Do the same for the other sections respecting the ascending order of play and their target number. For every roll of 1 0r 6 tic the box accordingly and roll again, later subtracting or adding based on results. A 6 represents a great fight move, a 1 represents getting hit. You're given 6 rerolls due to your bar fighting experience, tic them off as you use them. In the end, calculate your total number. Will you come out unscathed? Or bruised with a broken limb? Or will you get knocked out? A negative result means you got knocked out, a zero means you barely made it, any positive number means you defended yourself well and did some damage, the higher the number the better!<br/><br/>&mdash;description from the designer<br/><br/>",

The higher blue or red total wins!<br/><br/>Nineveh: Tug-of-War is based on true historical events.  After the death of the Assyrian King Ashurbanipal in 631BC, a series of civil wars ensued between his sons, Prince Ashuretli and Prince Sinshar, in a struggle for control of the throne.  As a top general representing a Prince, the chaos has created your path into power.  In this battle of Tug of War, you must defeat your rival to end the civil war as your prince assumes the throne in Nineveh and rules the Assyrian Empire.<br/><br/>In this civil war, you will lead both Assyrian forces (red cards) and foreign forces (blue cards) in your attempt to gain control of the empire.  Each player alternates playing offense and defense and can only defeat a city during an offensive attack to gain a victory point.  On defense, you will defend 3 cities sympathetic to your cause, giving you an advantage by getting to pick either red or blue forces to defend with and by also adding reinforcements to bolster your defense. Lose these 3 cities and you lose the civil war.<br/><br/>The mixed loyalties in this civil war have caused great mistrust between your Assyrian forces (red cards) and your foreign forces (blue cards), causing you to form 2 different armies.  Your Assyrian force has little will to fight rival Assyrian forces.  Your foreign forces also have little will to fight rival foreign forces.  So, when you decide to defend a city with either red or blue cards, your opponent must attack with the opposite colored force.<br/><br/>Do you have the military expertise necessary to defeat your opponent? Are you savvy enough to trap your opponent into wasting resources and to capitalize on their mistakes, or will you be defeated in this civil war?<br/><br/>&mdash;description from the designer<br/><br/>",

Fulfilling a contract will gain you experience.<br/>     Use your experience to attract and befriend Noble's who want to use you for heirloom pieces and who will spread the word about you to their friends, which will earn you the much coveted &quot;Fame&quot;.<br/>     Build up enough &quot;Fame&quot; to take home the prize and become the &quot;Royal Jeweler&quot;!<br/><br/><br/><br/>    Game Setup#<br/>     Each player choose a color and collect the 3 worker meeples of that color, then take a work station card and place it in front of them.<br/>     Place the raw material card within reach of all players. Place all gems in their spots.<br/>     Shuffle the Noble cards and place a number equal to 1 plus the number of players to form the top row of the &quot;board&quot;.<br/>     Shuffle the Contract cards, cut the deck in half and flip one side, then shuffle again and deal out 3 contracts face up in rows below each Noble to complete the &quot;board&quot;.<br/>     Begin (Use your chosen method for deciding who takes the first turn).<br/><br/><br/>Steps of each turn<br/>Place/Move Workers - to bid on contracts. In this step you will send each of you available workers to bid on a specific contract.  If you have no available workers, you may move 1 worker from an uncontested contract and reassign it to any other contract. (Uncontested means that your worker is the only worker bidding on that contract.  If another player has placed a worker on any contract that your worker is bidding on, it becomes &quot;contested&quot; and neither worker can move until one of the players fulfills the contract)<br/><br/>Gather Raw Materials - Roll the 3 dice and either collect those 3 raw materials, or sacrifice one of the 3 dice and re-roll the remaining 2 dice.  Then either collect those 2 raw materials or sacrifice 1 dice and re-roll the remaining 1 dice and collect the raw material from the result.  (This indicates you going deeper into the bazaar in search of the perfect gemstone, but often you won't find it and you will never get the best deal)          <br/>Place all raw materials onto your work station in the appropriate space<br/><br/>The Main Step - During the Main step of your turn you will choose from 1 of 4 potential actions. (Limited to a single action per turn)<br/><br/><br/>     Complete a contract - If you have the required raw materials on your work station, you may choose to complete one of the contracts that your worker has bid on.  Once you complete a contract, you will take it and place it under the lower part of your workstation so that only the &quot;Experience&quot; section remains showing (See Action Shot).  Then return any workers that were bidding on the contract back to their owners and replace the contract by dealing one from the &quot;Contract&quot; deck.<br/>     Befriend a Noble - If you have collected enough &quot;Experience&quot; to befriend a Noble, you may do so.  Do so by taking the Noble that you want to befriend and placing it beneath the top portion of your work station so that only the gold star &quot;Fame&quot; symbol is showing (See Action Shot).  Then replace that Noble with one from the top of the &quot;Nobles&quot; deck. If the Noble you befriend adds enough &quot;Fame&quot; for you to win the game, you win as soon as you befriend him/her and the game ends.  (Shuffle up and play again)<br/>     Bribe a Noble - For the low cost of twice the &quot;Fame&quot; rating of a Noble (Payable using any gems or gold from your stockpile), you can bribe them to leave the board and be replaced with the top Noble from the deck.  This tactic comes in very handy if, for instance, you see that your opponent is going to win or close to being able to befriend a Noble that may turn the game to their advantage.  Also good to help clear Nobles that aren't a good fit for the current &quot;board&quot;.<br/>     Pass - Occasionally there is nothing that you can do with your current worker placement or workstation stockpile.  When that happens, you can simply pass and end your turn.<br/><br/><br/>Winning the game<br/>Solo Mode - Playing this game solo is a race against the clock!  You will play &quot;Easy, Normal or Hard mode&quot; by trying to reach 3,4 or 5 stars of &quot;Fame&quot; faster than the creator's best score AND before the 12 turn clock ends and you lose the game outright!  Keep track of your personal best scores using the space allotted in the back of the rule book.<br/><br/>Normal Mode (2-6 Players) - When playing with other people, the goal is to become the most famous jeweler before they do.  The objective will be to reach a level of &quot;Fame&quot; equal to 1 plus the number of players. **EX.**3 players is 1+3=4 stars of &quot;Fame&quot; to win.  The first person to reach the &quot;Fame&quot; amount required wins immediately after befriending the Noble whose &quot;Fame&quot; rating puts them over the top!<br/><br/>&mdash;description from the publisher<br/><br/>",

        "description": "The Depressing Game is a social deduction game, where players take on the role of high school students who have to deal with depression on a daily basis<br/><br/>This game was designed by the students of Nanakuli High School, located on the west coast of O'ahu, Hawaii.<br/><br/>While understanding the serious of the topic, this card game is light and humorous, and uses satire to explore the sensitive subject.<br/><br/>Gameplay summary:<br/><br/>You are high school students interacting on campus. The happy players are attempting to find out who is the depressed player and bring them around to the realm of sunshine. The depressed player is attempting to infect the other players with a contagion of woe.<br/><br/>A the beginning of the game platers are dealt a hidden role.<br/><br/><br/>     If you are secretly playing a Happy Role (weirdo) the last round must be won by a Happy Card.<br/>     If you are secretly playing the Depressed Role (I feel for you) the last round must be won by a Depressing Card DR the last round ends in a tie.<br/><br/><br/>On a turn:<br/><br/>     Each player selects 1 card from their hand and places it face down ... (thinking about rainbows)<br/>     All players then say &quot;HAPPY!&quot; and reveal their cards simultaneously.<br/>     A player wins the round and furthers their secret agenda by having the highest numeric value of all cards played. Tied numbers cancel each other out. <br/><br/><br/>The player who plays the highest number wins the round. All tied numbers cancel out and count as zero.<br/><br/>The winner of the round selects 1 action (A or B)<br/><br/>a)Take a card from the Tableau of Emotions (cards in the center of the table). Now take a card from your hand and place that card face up in the Tableau of Emotions.<br/><br/>b)Take a card from the Tableau of Emotions(cards in the center of the table). Now take a random card from another player's hand and place that card face up in the Tableau of Emotions.<br/><br/>The winner will gather all the cards just played. place them together face-down in a &quot;Discard pile&quot; and place that pile aside. Place all played cards in the Discard pile from now on. No players may look at the discarded cards during the game.<br/><br/>Continue playing cards round after round until each player is down to their last card. This is the round that counts for the game.<br/><br/>All players play their last card face down. Before flipping over their last card, all players reveal their Hidden Role.<br/><br/>Players flip over their last cards following the same rules. Except the winning card's type (Happy or Depressed) determines the winner.<br/><br/>&mdash;description from the designer<br/><br/>",

        "description": "Carrot Bunny Den is a competitive little card game to share among friends (ages 18+). It is played by 3 to 10 players and games last about 15 minutes. It is very quick to learn and triggers good bursts of laughter. The graphical direction may surprise you but it's just like the gameplay, it looks cute but it's hard!<br/><br/>In Carrot Bunny Den, nature goes crazy and it's up to us to fix it. Each player starts with 3 cards representing combinations of the words &quot;carrot&quot;, &quot;rabbit&quot; and &quot; den&quot; and a decadent vision of our poor nature. During the game, the players exchange words by pointing at each other and saying one of these three words. But beware, each word has an associated rule! One must not make mistakes when speaking and remain attentive to the words spoken. Indeed, when a spoken combination corresponds to one of your cards, you can put it down!<br/><br/>It's a game of memory and quick decision making. Players must choose the words they say skillfully and quickly, according to their hand. They choose who they give the floor to based on what they understand of other people's play. They have to adapt constantly to hope to put down every card. The first player to put down all his hand wins the round and the game is played in three winning rounds. Nature needs you! Ready for the challenge?<br/><br/>&mdash;description from the designer<br/><br/>",

Finally, on September 10th, 1944, Field Marshall Montgomery met with Dwight Eisenhower at Melsbroek airfield outside of Brussels. At this meeting, Montgomery won approval for an ambitious plan to allow the Allies to drive from Belgium through Holland and then cross the Rhine River into Germany - an operation that called for three airborne divisions to be landed in stages over three days miles behind enemy lines - code name: Market Garden.<br/><br/>",

All those actions will earn the player the Great Leader's favor, which having the most of, is by itself the game's sole victory condition. But the Great Leader's favor can also be spent to obtain resources, so the players must carefully measure when and how much to bank on that political capital.<br/><br/>The game board depicts North Korea and is divided by geographical regions, One distinctive mechanism of the game is the elaborate use of shared resources within the country, meaning that, in a turn, a player must activate a whole region, paying the activation cost of all buildings there, regardless of which player they belong to. The player may also use the power and railway networks, built by any player, to pay those costs, and that would result in them gaining the favor of the Great Leader.<br/>The international aspect is also an involved semi-cooperative system of several intertwined elements, ranging from smuggling arms and workers to other rogue countries, buildings defenses against Imperialist's air attacks, up to the dreaded nuclear project. This military aspect is equally important as the economic one, since it often carries punishing results and a number of losing conditions.<br/><br/>With its abstracted mechanisms and the graphical use of the actual idealistic aesthetic of the North Korean regime's propaganda, the game manages to remain suitable for younger audiences. Adults, nonetheless, will recognize in the bizarre cartoony card images the sharp contrast with the known realities of the country.<br/><br/>&mdash;description from the designer<br/><br/>",

Players will decide when and were to maneuver their troops to aggressively take the battle to the enemy and when to react defensively if troops under their command retreat or rout. Victory or defeat is determined by winning the objectives of a game scenario, inflicting more causalities, and controlling portions of the battlefield.<br/><br/>Scales:<br/>figures: 10mm-15mm-25mm<br/>1 mini = 50 men<br/>1 cannon model = 1 arty battery<br/>1&quot; = 25 yd<br/><br/>",

Then it&rsquo;s onto London&rsquo;s Olympia where the First World Scout Jamboree took place, before a whistle stop tour of our Scout Adventure Centres. The stations are now our nation headquarters.

A local ghost story rooted in bits of truth, the tale of Bleak Lily is actually the tragic story of Lily Abernethy, one of the estate&rsquo;s original owners who took to haunting the house after a suspicious and untimely demise. In the years after Lily&rsquo;s passing, numerous people have died on the grounds of Indigo House, and although there is never anything to prove that the ghost of Lily Abernethy is to blame, people still whisper that the bloodshed is her handiwork. The Van Burens bought Indigo House from the Abernethy family around the turn of the 20th century and have done their best to shake off the curse of Bleak Lily. However, the rumors started up again when the matriarch of the family, Hilda Van Buren, was found dead in her bed. Was Mrs. Van Buren&rsquo;s death from natural causes? Did Bleak Lily claim another casualty? Or is there something else sinister at work?<br/><br/>Difficulty Level: 7.5/10<br/><br/>",
