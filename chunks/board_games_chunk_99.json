At the beginning of the game, each player is dealt a hand of six cards. Each player now takes turns, playing one card on the 3x3 grid on the table and replenishing back to six. The crucial thing is that you can play your card on top of your opponent's card on the grid as long as the number on your card is higher than the existing number on grid. The Wild card counts as the highest number when you play, the lowest when it is already on the table.<br/><br/>Whenever you make a three in a row with your played cards, you score 1. Anyone who scores 5 first wins the game.<br/><br/>",

        "description": "This game depicts, in a very abstract way, the essence of insurgent warfare. The game is for two players, the State (representing the existing government or leadership of a country or organization) and the Insurgent (representing the opposition to that government or leadership). The State has powerful forces but little information; the Insurgent has complete information but little actual power. Whichever side overcomes its disadvantage wins (the State by gaining information on the Insurgents and killing them; the Insurgents by penetrating to the centre of State power).<br/><br/>The Insurgent wins by capturing the Capital. This is accomplished by having, at the end of any his player-turns, Insurgent pieces occupying either four connected spaces in the Inner Circle (that is, there are at least four Insurgent-occupied spaces in the Inner Circle that also share a border with one or two other Insurgent-occupied spaces in the Inner Circle), or occupying any six of the twelve spaces of the Inner Circle.<br/><br/>The State player wins by killing 12 Insurgent pieces (so making an Insurgent victory impossible).<br/><br/>Originally designed in 2011 for an online game site, from an idea by Michael Freeman.<br/><br/>",

Building special abilities also take place during this phase.<br/>    Phase 4 (Action) - Players can play any Attack or Magic cards in hand if they have more Warrior(Attack) or Shaman(Magic) cards than their target. These allow the player to destroy, steal from  and generally muck with the targeted opponent.<br/><br/><br/>At the end of the 4th phase, the player trims his hand down to 5 cards and play continues with the next player.

        "description": "Mitaines is a French Canadian game: the French word 'mitaines' means mittens. The game is also known in English as Mitts. Cards are played to a common discard pile, which can be captured by matching its top card or playing a jack. Points are scored for sets of two or more equal ranked cards played to the common discard pile: two equal cards are a mitaine (mitten), three cards are a gant (glove), and four cards are a chausson (sock).<br/><br/>Each turn, a player plays one card to the discard pile. If he plays a Jack or a card matching the top card of the discard pile, he captures the pile, which may be worth points, if it contains the ten of diamonds.<br/><br/>Alternatively, a player may call a mitten, glove or sock. If he does so, he plays the first card of his combination. The next card is played on his next turn, etc. When he completes his combination, he scores points for that combination. When a combination has been called, the discard pile cannot be cleared. However, other players can steal the combination by calling a higher combination (which is either a larger combination or a combination with higher cards). If such a player completes their combination, they score both their own combination and any combinations they have stolen.<br/><br/>Multiple hands are played until a player (or team) reaches 500 points; that player (or team) wins the game.<br/><br/>",

The next player must play one or more cards that sum to the next number in sequence. (For example, if the first player laid down a 4, the next player must play a 5, a 4 and 1, etc.) If a player can't play, they must draw from the deck and the the next player in clockwise order is obliged to play the required number.<br/><br/>When a player empties their hand, the round ends and everyone scores negative points equal to their cards still in hand.

Powers of darkness retreated, but it was just a temporary respite.<br/><br/>Be prepared for the full battle with the Manticore! Investigate the forest and construct roads to the magical armor and amulets. Monsters &ndash; servants of darkness &ndash; will hinder you. Time is limited: as soon as magical fetters are off, the monster will start his fire path to the Castle in order to become the Absolute Lord of the Forest. Don&rsquo;t waste a minute: find the artifacts that are the only chance for a victory.<br/><br/>Two variants of the game: team-play against the Manticore (against the system) where the team either together wins or loose; and individual game face-to-face with the Monster.<br/><br/>The legend returns!<br/><br/>ESSENCE OF THE GAME:<br/>   <br/>Players begin their journey in the Forest world of the City which is soon to undergo an invasion of the awakened Manticore. At first the players should find their way into the abandoned workshops and places of power around the City &ndash; where they will be able to acquire weapons and artifacts that enhance certain characteristics of the hero. Pathfinding is carried out with laying on the board of tiles depicting the road. Each of the players paves the way for their own, but can also use the road paved by other players. Some tiles contain a monster - if a player has laid out such tile, then a monster token is placed. Player may try to circumvent a monster, but may also fight him.<br/><br/>After all the tiles are exhausted, the Manticore awakens and begins moving in the direction of the City. If the Manticore reaches the City - all the players loose the game, so the task of the Players is to defeat the Manticore before her arrival in the City.<br/>    <br/>Battle with monsters and with the Manticore is made with a die roll. However, in addition, there are also random battle cards that determine what type of attack (magic, melee, shooting) is used in this round of the fight (see &lsquo;Conducting a fight&rsquo;). Card is opened blindly, and can bring a pleasant surprise (attack with the most developed hero&rsquo;s skill) or not pleasant. This encourages players to improve different abilities of their heroes.<br/>AWARDS<br/>Winner of the &quot;Baby Expo Ukraine 2018&quot; (best strategy game)<br/><br/>",

Luckily Too-Ticky is enjoying the sunny day and if one is lucky he or she might get a lift from Too-Ticky on her hot air balloon.

Bring home the classic game of falling bricks coupled with elements from the blockbuster Transformers: Revenge of the Fallen movie. For ages 6 and up, this family game for two or more players allows you to take control of Cybertron-- or family game night-- with your robot-like brick-removal skill. The tiles feature Autobot or Decepticon faction logos and are made from a tasteful, black material. Build and battle with the Transformers Revenge of the Fallen Jenga Battle Game!<br/><br/>How to Play:<br/><br/>Divide up into two teams Autobots and Decepticons. The Decepticons go first. Teams alternate turns, rotating so that each player gets chance to play.<br/><br/>on you turn, remove one block. Then see if the block shows a symbol:<br/><br/>    if it does not show your TEAM&acute;s symbol, stack the block on top of the tower<br/>    if it shows your TEAM&acute;s symbol, pass it to a player of your choice on the other team. this player must stack the block before the team takes its turn.<br/><br/><br/>Winning:<br/><br/>If the tower falls over on your team&acute;s turn, your TEAM LOSES. The other TEAM WIN!.<br/><br/>",

The winner is the first to get 6 coloured pegs in his scoring row.<br/><br/>Beginning of the game :<br/>Place the nine cubes colour side up. You have one minutes to memorize each one&rsquo;s location before turning them face down. The youngest player starts by rolling both dice, then play continue clockwise.<br/><br/>Rules of play :<br/>The white die indicates the colour the player has to find, if it shows a star the player may choose the colour to find. He then turn over one of the cubes.<br/><br/>-If it is the right colour, the player puts one peg of the same colour in his scoring row, he then put back the cube but switching its location with another cube and without looking at the colour of the other cube. Then he gives the dice to the player to his left.<br/><br/>-If its not the right colour, he simply put the cube back in place and gives the dices to the player to his left.<br/><br/>Play continue until one plyer has filled the six spaces in his score row.<br/><br/>The black die :<br/>If ithe black die shows a star and the white die shows a colour, all players may look for the corresponding cube. The fastest player to put his finger on a cube then turn it face up, if it is the right colour, he wins a coloured peg and play continues as normal. If it is not the right colour he loses a peg of that colour if he has one in his score raw, and play resumes as normal.<br/><br/>If a player wins a peg of a colour that is no longer available he may steal if from one of the other players scoring row.<br/><br/><br/>    The black die is not recommended when playing with children under the age of 7.<br/><br/><br/>",

The space you land on decide what kind of question you will get. The questions are about science, biology, physics and common knowledge, but there are also riddles. If you get the answer right you get pieces of paper that look like money, but they actually represent different amount of brain cells. <br/>When you have enough brain cells you get to enter the paths that go into the middle of the board. On those paths you continue to get questions, but you also get to do challenges. The challenges are things you do with your body, for example you could get a card that says you have 30 seconds to try and wiggle your ears using only the muscles in your head. When you successfully do a challenge you get a star. <br/>When you have gathered 3 stars you are allowed to try and reach the very center of the board. The first one to get there (with the right amount of brain cells AND stars) wins the game. <br/>As a reward the winner of the game gets to perform an experiment from the experiment folder. As an example, the experiment can be to charge a comb with static electricity and then hold it agains a stream of water and see what happens.<br/><br/>",

Police forces are tasked to go undercover and identify the rebel leaders, before they have time to gather too many followers in the population.<br/> Rebels Unite! is a party game for 8 to 20+ players, in which you play as a policeman, a rebel leader, or a civilian. Police officers have to arrest the rebel leaders, civilians try to help them in their task, unless they are turned into rebels themselves by a rebel leader. Rebel leaders have to turn as many civilians into rebels as possible without getting caught, and with their help overthrow the corrupt government and start a rebellion!<br/><br/>Rebels Unite! is a game of deception and hidden information. At the beginning of the game each player is given an identity that is unknown to everyone else. Players will try to convince each other that they are staying true to the government, but in the meantime a rebellion is growing behind the scenes. During the game, players will be able to find out and guess each other&rsquo;s identities, so it will be harder and harder to get away with lying and playing both sides of the conflict.<br/><br/>",

        "description": "Chwedlau Cymru / Legends of Wales is a card game featuring creatures and monsters from Welsh mythology such as the Twrch Trwyth or the Red Dragon itself. Each of the cards features a different creature along with a value attribute (up to 10) and a set of attribute scores: Strength, Skill, Magic and Fear, as well as a &quot;size&quot; attribute that can either be small, medium (i.e. man sized) or large.<br/><br/>On its simplest level, it can be played as a deck of Top Trumps cards for 2-4 players. The set however also comes with rules for playing a slightly more complex 2-player card game.<br/><br/>In this version of the game, players take it in turns to draft a hand of 5 cards from the deck, with a maximum total value of 30. Both players will be able to see which cards their opponent is drafting. The undrafted cards form a draw deck. One of the four main values is then drawn at random by drawing the top card of the deck a, and the players decide on an order for their cards; this order cannot then be changed. The cards will then face off against their opponents in order, comparing the values drawn. The players thus need to try and second-guess which cards they think their opponent will place in which order.<br/><br/>This initial first round is won by the player who won the most of the five faceoffs between the cards. The &quot;defeated&quot; cards are discarded and replacements are drawn randomly from the deck (back up to five cards) for the next round. The game is decided by a best-of-three of the three rounds.<br/><br/>This initial set focuses on monsters and creatures. The publisher claims that more game modes will be added with future card sets / expansions, which may feature more individual characters.<br/><br/>The most distinctive feature of the game is the unique artwork by cartoonist/designer Huw Aaron. The initial print run featured separate Welsh-language and English-language sets.<br/><br/>",

After the initial Birth of Creation storyline, the themes get more epic with galaxy and nebula-infused creatures. Drama rises within the Skyborn Guild, and two-thirds of their members betray the Angels to form the Order Guild.

Weapons are played into the columns and move over to the opponent's cruiser in an attempt to cause damage. Each player has a command queue that they load cards into the back of and execute from the front of. This queue is played face up so your opponent has an idea of what you intend to do, but each card has two options so you are never sure what is going to happen.<br/><br/>It works like a two-player space invaders, with weapon cards moving across the space between cruisers and causing damage if they reach the other side.

The first player of the round removes one dark blue token at random, looking at the value if desired. Players then take turns in clockwise order. On a turn, you must jump a token over an adjacent token or a line of two adjacent tokens onto an empty space. After jumping, the player claims the firstmost token that they jumped. If a player claims a dark blue token, they take another turn immediately. The round ends once no more jumps can be made, then players tally their score. Once all players have been first player once, the game ends and whoever has the highest score wins.<br/><br/>In solo play, you compete for the highest score possible.<br/><br/>Skip55 also includes arithmetic cards &mdash; four each of +, -, &times;, and &divide; &mdash; that can be used as a variant. Shuffle these cards, then place them face down. After a player claims a token, they draw the top card from the deck, then place it to the right of their token. At game's end, you calculate your score by summing your score from left to right, using the mathematical symbols to combine your numbers. (Use the absolute value of a result following division, e.g., 11&divide;3 = 3.666, which would be 3.)<br/><br/>",

Take the game box and place the cover below it. Shuffle and place the letter cards vertically between the box and the cover, gift picture hidden. Place the gift tiles inside the box and shuffle them.<br/><br/>The player takes a letter card, then they search for the corresponding gifts among those in the box, taking a gift tile: if right, the player places the gift tile on the Christmas Tree and then takes the corresponding letter card, representing a point; if wrong, the player puts the gift tile back in the box face down. The next player will try to guess the correct gift tile, and so on, until one finds the correct tile. The game continues with the next player clockwise: taking a new letter card trying to find the corresponding gift in the box. The game ends when the players match all gift tiles with corresponding letter cards. The winner is the one who collected the highest number of letter cards.<br/><br/>Which are the available places on the Christmas Tree? Each level of the tree is divided in 4 sectors: players should place gift tiles of the same colours on each sector of the levels. The colour is determined by the Christmas Ball picture on each sector. Furthermore, each sector of the lowest level can have max. 3 gift tiles, in the middle level max. 2 gift tiles and in the highest level just 1.<br/>Attention: If a player, while placing a gift tile on the Christmas Tree, makes one or more tiles fall down, they loose the just gained letter card, which has to be given to another played (they can choose whom). Fallen gift tiles should be placed back in the box with remaining tiles: increasing the difficulty of the game.<br/><br/>",

        "description": "The Slasher Movie can be scary, ridiculous, gory, trashy, witty social commentary or just dumb fun.  SLASHR is a fast playing, free wheeling Slasher Movie emulator captured in 9 simple playing cards.<br/><br/>Before starting play, make sure that you set the rating for this movie (a PG-13 game is very different than the Hard R version).  If we are okay with our movie getting a hard R Rating, make sure that the players are all comfortable with that.  You may want to check out some standard RPG safety mechanics - such as an X-CARD.<br/><br/>Have everyone sit around a circle.  Take your SLASHR deck, shuffle it, and put it in the middle of the area you are playing, in easy reach for all the players.  If you really want to get in the mood, service some greasy popcorn, turn the lights down and sing &quot;Let's All Go to the Lobby&quot;.<br/><br/>As a group, come up with a setting for a 1980s-style exploitation flick.  Once you have a setting, settle on a title for the film.  The setting and title are going to really lock down what the players do over the course of the movie.<br/><br/>The first player is the last person to have seen a horror movie.  They begin the game by introducing themselves (their actual self) as starring as a character in the movie.  So, for instance, let's say that we are playing a movie called Unholy Pigskin (a PG-13 slasher about a High School Football team full of vampires.  You would say something like, &quot;Starring Chris O'Neill as Head Coach N. Romancer&quot;. Then have the next player in the circule introduce themselves and so on, until everyone has been introduced.<br/><br/>Each player will then take a turn creating a scene in the Movie.  The most important thing to remember is that you are SETTING UP A SCENE - not resolving it.  To properly set up a scene, it should involve your character, at least one other character, and a location. These two players should both want something, or need an answer to a question.  This simple mechanic should drive us immediately into action.  &quot;Okay, so the Cheerleader and I are having a fight in the parking lot about leaving town.&quot;<br/><br/>When the scene starts, the players can start role-playing their characters, or narrating activity in the scene.  Anyone that is not directly involved in the scene acts as additional &quot;uncredited&quot; characters and background effects.<br/><br/>When one of the following happens, ANY PLAYER should yell CUT!<br/><br/>     A Character is about to get the thing they want.<br/>     A Character is about to get the answer to a question.<br/>     Anything stupid, weird, or dangerous occurs.<br/>     Things are getting slow or boring in any way.<br/><br/><br/>Whenever someone yells CUT! the active player takes the SLASHR deck, cuts it, and flips over the top card.  Depending on the card, the scene is then resolved in a specific way.  After resolving the scene, shuffle the deck and play passes to the next player clockwise.<br/><br/>FEAR, LUST, LIES, GREED, or STUPIDITY(THE RED CARDS) If the player cuts to a RED CARD, they resolve the scene in their favor using the prompt on the card, then return that card to the deck.<br/><br/>MURDERED (BLACK CARDS)<br/>When you pull a BLACK CARD, you got Murdered.  In the game, this means that this scene - no matter what it was about - ends in your grisly murder at the hands of the SLASHR KILLR.  Only the ACTIVE PLAYER dies, and they always get to narrate their own death!  If the Slasher has not been revealed yet, the death should be laden with mystery.<br/><br/>When you die, you flip over the remaining cards in the SLASHR deck and take one of the 5 RED CARDS out (Fear, Lust, Lies, Greed, and Stupidity) and plays it face up in front of them.<br/><br/>When your character has been eliminated, you are still playing.  If it becomes your turn again, instead of setting up a scene with your character - you set up and narrate a quick scene using your prompt as inspiration.  You are encouraged to be the unnamed people in the other player's scenes in the movie, to add narration, to make sound effects, and to shout encouragement from your theater seats.<br/><br/>Don't forget to put the BLACK CARD back into the deck.<br/><br/>DON'T TURN AROUND<br/>If the player cuts to DON'T TURN AROUND, they have a brush with Death, but don't die.  Early on in the game, when this happens - the player should narrate their &quot;jump scare&quot; or &quot;cheap heat&quot; moment - cats jumping out, car crashes, kids pretending to be the murderer, etc.<br/><br/>After the SLASHR is in play, this card should always result in a near death experience with the SLASHR KILLR.  Put the card back in the deck.<br/><br/>SLASHR<br/>When you flip the SLASHR card - you are the SLASHR.  You should resolve the scene as the SLASHR, revealing your identity and motive.  You get to resolve the scene in your favor - but as your can only die when you are the active player, your opponent in the scene does not get killed.<br/><br/>YOUR INEVITABLE GRISLY DEATH<br/>As you play, you will be removing cards form the deck, and making it MORE LIKELY that the next player is going to die. With either (a) the deck runs out of RED Cards, or (b) there is only the SLASHR. and one other person alive; the game ends.  Each player that was eliminated during the game gets a chance to &quot;pitch&quot; the ending of the movie to the remaining player(s).  The ending should involved the survivors defeating the SLASHR or getting away.  Afterwards, the SLASHRget to add a &quot;sequel clause&quot; scene where they show how they actually survived for the next movie.<br/><br/>",

Also, two six-sided dice of different colors are used (one light and one dark). Two dice are enough for all players.<br/><br/>OBJECTIVE: Draw a passable area from the entrance of the Z Zone to the exit and activate the generator to open the door. If there are several players, they must also try to get the most Victory Points to win. If you play solo, try to beat your own score.<br/><br/>Game Play:<br/><br/>1. Roll the dice. Every player must cross out the rolled sector in his or her Sector Table. If the rolled sector is already crossed out, the player must select the previous or the next available sector in the row. If there are no available sectors in the row, you can select the last available sector of the rows above or the first available sector of the rows below. If you want to use a shelter, you can do it now.<br/><br/>2. All players draw the sector they crossed out on their Z Zone, then they color it. You can draw it on any free square (it does not have to be adjacent to other drawn square), but it must be drawn just as shown in the Sector Table, i.e., you cannot rotate it. If the new sector is added to the passable area, color it with the appropriate color.<br/><br/>3. If a zombie is activated, circle it. If you cannot kill all the activated zombies (by crossing out as many guns as the number of activated zombies), you lose immediately.<br/><br/>4. You can activate the grenade if it is in the passable area.<br/><br/>The game ends at the 20th turn, i.e., when you have drawn 20 sectors in all the 20 squares of your Z Zone. If you draw a passable area from the entrance to the exit and it has a generator within before the 20th turn, you do not win yet. If the 20th turn begins and you have not drawn a generator in your Z Zone yet, ignore the rolled sector and draw one of the two sectors which have the generator within. At the end of the 20th turn, surviving players must check if they have activated the generator and drawn a passable area from the entrance to the exit. Those who succeeded, count their Victory Points &mdash;the player with the most Victory Points is the winner. If no one succeeded, everybody loses the game.<br/><br/>",

        "description": "January 1919. Poland returned to the map of Europe only two months earlier. Now the Republic desperately needs reforms which can be carried out only by Sejm. Even though the country doesn't even have its borders set up, the Chief of State calls for democratic election which will allow to choose the Representatives of the whole society. It's time for the first election campaign of the Second Polish Republic!<br/><br/>&quot;Wybory 1919&quot; is a dynamic boardgame in which the players are the leaders of four main political forces in the interwar Poland. They try to lead their parties to victory in the upcoming elections. By playing action cards, they compete for support in four main social groups: peasantry, city dwellers, workers and the minorities. They can increase their own popularity and place a supporter meeple in their color in one of the groups, decrease others' support, manipulate the regional elections' order or even cancel elections in some constituencies by calling in the military actions in the region. Each player gets an identical deck of 9 action cards at the start of the game, but draws up to the limit of three cards at random in their turn - reshuffling the discard pile if the draw pile runs out. Players need to strategize based on their current hand and pay attention to the cards that their opponents have already used.<br/><br/>Whoever gets the majority in each of the three groups favoured in the current round's constituency, wins the seat for their representative in that round of elections. The party that gets more representatives than any of the others after the last round is resolved, wins the game and assists in writing the Second Polish Republic's history!<br/><br/>The game was commissioned by the Social Communication Bureau at Chancellery of the Sejm of the Republic of Poland for the 100th anniversary of the first elections in Second Polish Republic. It's meant as an educational tool in teaching history and promotional item for the Sejm. As such, it hasn't been available in retail. The instructions booklet contains more detailed historical background on the elections of 1919-1920 in Poland. The action cards provide some basic information on the leaders of each political side as well as flavor texts in the form of newspaper quotes from that time.<br/><br/>",

The servants are our lead suspects and it's up to you to unearth the evidence, seek out the suspects and catch the culprit in order to scupper the other sleuths, and win this game of murder! There's more than one way to catch a killer though. So what's it gonna be? Good Cop or Bad Cop? These two game versions come with their own set of rules and tactics to crack the case and finger your suspect, but will you use fair play or FOUL PLAY?<br/><br/>The Game is Afoot! Playing as detective, you&rsquo;ll need to find the three evidence cards that point to a specific suspect in order to catch a killer in this crazy criminal caper. Will you uncover them in the crime scene? Could the other detectives be willing to collaborate and share their findings? Or will you resort to more tricky tactics, and plunder the proof you need to solve this crime?<br/><br/>Detectives (players) have to deduce information from the Evidence Locker and Crime Scene to solve the murder.<br/><br/>The game has Two Playing Variants:<br/><br/>Good Cop (Catch A Killer) - set-up by placing the Evidence cards face down according to color and shuffle each pile. The remaining cards form the Evidence Locker. Add one card from each Evidence pile into the Evidence Locker and discard the rest. Shuffle the Evidence Locker and 9 cards into a 3x3 grid (The Crime Scene) in the center of the playing area. Deal 5 cards face down to each player. Then place the remaining Evidence Locker, face down, to one side of the Crime Scene.<br/><br/>Bad Cop (Frame a suspect) All cards are in play - so shuffle the full deck and then follow the same set up as Good Cop, deal 7 cards to each player and you're ready to go.<br/><br/>Detectives play the game by discarding or playing cards on their turn, choosing between fair and foul play cards. The winner is the Detective who determines who the murderer is and has the killer in their hand when making an accusation.<br/><br/>",

        "description": "Disparity Trap: The Socially Conscious Board Game is a game where player can learn how race as a system impacts those of us who live within the United States. Disparity Trap can bring conversations about race to effective levels whether played at home with friends and family, in professional settings, or in junior high through college-level classrooms.<br/><br/>The game play is like many of its kind, where your individual goal is to accrue as much wealth as possible. But where it differs is that you can play competitvely or cooperatively where you work with your fellow players to dismantle the Disparity Traps seeking to keep everyone in poverty. Within this game you also step into someone else&rsquo;s shoes; to experience the disparities within an identity different from your own. Throughout the game, the dice roll correlates your identity in the game to real life statistics. So like life, the dice are in your &ldquo;hands,&rdquo; but the odds are not.<br/><br/>In the competitive version, the first play around the board wins.  In the cooperative version, all players must make it to Tier 3 and obtain 3 or more wealth tiles.  If, however, any 2 players are separated by more than 1 tier, the game is lost.<br/><br/>A print-n-play workbook is available for educators and cards have QR codes for more learning opportunities.  A simplified version of the rules was released in 2024.<br/><br/>&mdash;description from the designer<br/><br/>",

All the interests of the crown are now in your hands with your decisions in this adventure through the seas, where you can find treasures in other confines, but beware that the sea has many dangers and fears such as meeting the terrible monster of the Kraken.<br/><br/>In an adventure and decision-making game, you must get the highest number of stars in the fewest number of moves presented in 3 independent adventures in different years, 1538, 1542, and 1548 in print and play format.<br/><br/>In order to move about the map, throw the dice. Next, find &lsquo;Start&rsquo; in the top row (on the navigation bar around the map) and count the number of cells you&rsquo;ve thrown. For example, if you find yourself on cell 5L this will mean that you can move 5 cells to the left and 2 cells to the right. The L in 5L stands for left, you can move in the opposite direction, but only half of the cells are specified by the number. When you are moving about on the map, you may encounter a question mark &lsquo;?&rsquo;. If you happen to land on it, you will partake in a random event. Take notice that the map contains Krakens, fish, and ships. They have damage and hp number written next to them. When you land on a cell with one of those things, you will have to battle what&rsquo;s on it. The battle will be decided by throwing the dice. The purpose of the game is to collect more stars in fewer moves. You will earn the number of stars as written next to it. Keep in mind, that if the star is within a red square, you&rsquo;ll have to fight the boss guarding that terrain first.<br/><br/>The game comes in 6 different languages, something that makes it reach more patrons and is not limited by language, as well as low ink and color versions.<br/><br/>&mdash;description from the publisher<br/><br/>",

Kampo medicines have an image of being difficult to understand, but we have devised easy-to-understand packages so that customers can pick them up according to their symptoms and concerns.<br/><br/>&quot;Kampo Therapy&quot;, which was born in 2006, will celebrate its 15th anniversary this year. In the midst of rapid changes in lifestyles and values, we plan the first card game for Kracie Yakuhin, &quot;A game that makes you kind to people,&quot; with the desire to create a society where everyone can live their own way.・Developed. It is a content that thinks about the &quot;symptoms&quot; and &quot;worries&quot; of the body, which have not been the subject of communication so far. In this game, the players are divided into &quot;people who are unwell&quot; and &quot;people around them&quot;, and the &quot;people who are unwell&quot; who are unaware of their physical condition are called by the &quot;people around them&quot;. This is a game that aims to become aware of your symptoms using the therapy word as a hint.<br/><br/>Especially for women, there are many cases where it is difficult for them to confide in their health concerns, even to close people, and they do not understand well. Depending on the group you play this game with, such as family, friends, and partners, different discoveries and new understandings may be born. We hope that by having people enjoy &quot;being gentle&quot;, many people will deepen their understanding of each other, and that it will be an opportunity for a &quot;diversity society&quot; where everyone can live in their own way.<br/><br/>&quot;People who are unwell&quot; draw one from 45 types of &quot;symptom cards&quot; with various symptoms and hit it on the forehead so that it can be seen by all players other than yourself. Let the &quot;people around you&quot; look at the &quot;symptom card&quot; of the &quot;unwell person&quot; and apply the [therapy word] according to the method written on the &quot;approach card&quot; to have them notice the symptoms.<br/><br/>Let's say kind words according to the approach card<br/><br/>&quot;People around you&quot; apply [therapy words] to &quot;people who are unwell&quot; in a method based on 9 types of approach cards. In addition to &ldquo;experience/empathy,&rdquo; &ldquo;onomatopoeia,&rdquo; and &ldquo;concern,&rdquo; the approach cards also include &ldquo;Narikiri&rdquo; cards that let you pretend to be your boss, child, or lover. Let's look at. However, when using [Therapy Words], please be aware that words that include the name of the symptom cannot be used.<br/><br/>It's good to cooperate with everyone, it's good to compete, let's find your own way to play!<br/><br/>&quot;People who are not feeling well&quot; use the &quot;therapy words&quot; given by &quot;people around&quot; as hints, and while looking at the symptom list, answer what the &quot;symptom card&quot; they have is. You can only answer once. It is a success if the &quot;person with poor physical condition&quot; can guess their own &quot;symptom card&quot;. Regardless of success or failure, &quot;a person who is unwell&quot; will give a therapy chip to a person who thinks, &quot;This person's words were kind&quot; and &quot;He made me notice my symptoms well.&quot; increase. Repeat this while alternating the role of &quot;the unwell person&quot;. The game has a pattern where everyone cooperates and a pattern where you win or lose, so play with your favorite rules.<br/><br/>",

        "description": "Are you nostalgic for the days when romance meant making a mix-tape for someone? Feelings could be shown through only music and the decorations on a cassette tape.<br/><br/>Romance (ロマンス) is a reverse butting game. In most butting games, players try to avoid making choices that match those of other players, but in Romance, you try to match with exactly one other player. The game includes 56 cards with 8 different scenes or situations, and each card has a combination of scenes printed on both sides. The creates 28 possible combinations, and there are two of each combination in the deck. There are also cassette player cards where players will stack their scored cards. If you wish to play a 2-player game, the game includes rules for a dummy player.<br/><br/>Following the draw each turn, all players choose a card from their public hands and simultaneously play it. Any matching cards with the same situation showing are stacked together, and cards are drawn until there are as many situations on the table as there are players. Players then simultaneously select a situation. If exactly one player choose a situation, the card or cards go in their reserve. If three or more players have a matching choice, those cards remain in the play area. But if exactly two players choose a situation, they will score those cards. Once players have finished these steps, they may flip their entire public hand over so that the other side is now visible or return their hand to the deck and redraw.<br/><br/>Players place any scored situation cards on the cassette player cards that include both of their player colors. They score any cards from the stack in the center of the table, any visible matching cards from the players' hands, up to one card with a hidden matching side from each player, and any matching cards from their reserve. Each card will be worth one point. Once any cassette player has 10 cards stacked on it or the draw deck runs out of cards, players will add up their points from all cassette players that match their color. The player with the highest score wins.<br/><br/>",

If the player actually made a mistake, he loses a life. If everything was correct, the player who announced the mistake loses a life. When a player looses his last life, they are eliminated from the game.<br/><br/>There are also special cards in the deck, that will force you to either make additional combinations of the rules or change the existing ones.<br/><br/>After all cards from the deck has been flipped over, the round is over. Shuffle the discard pile to make a new deck so the new round can begin.<br/> The game ends when there is only one player left or after four rounds.<br/><br/>",

        "description": "Those pesky squirrels are after your hard earned stash of nuts, seeds, and pinecones! Be the lucky person with the most cards at the end of the round to win this game of choice, chance, and strategy.<br/><br/>Shuffle the deck of stash cards with 8 squirrels. The first player begins flipping over as many cards as he/she dares from the deck (each player MUST flip at least one card on each turn). The player may choose when to stop flipping and pass to the next player at any time. The object is to flip over as many cards as possible without unearthing a squirrel which will steal your stash! If any of the other players have accumulated stash cards during a round where someone flips over a squirrel, they get the reward of banking their nuts, seeds, and pinecones. After the deck is depleted, players count their cards to determine the winner. For more challenging play, add more squirrels! We've included 15 total squirrels to amp up the fun, or should we say frustration!<br/><br/>&mdash;description from the publisher<br/><br/>",

The goal of the game is to get yourself cancelled three times.<br/><br/>The game is played in the same format as Apples to Apples or Cards Against Humanity. Each round one player will be the judge or &quot;The Offended.&quot; The Offended will select one card from each of the following piles: Background, Status, and Occupation. Together these cards will form the role that the Offended must use to judge the phrases submitted by other players.<br/><br/>Each player will have a hand of 6 phrase cards. From their hand they will pick the phrase that they believe will be most offensive to The Offended, and pass it, face down, to The Offended. Once all players have submitted a card, The Offended will shuffle the cards then read each one aloud. Next, The Offended picks the card that most offends the role they have selected and then says &quot;You're Cancelled&quot; to whoever submitted that phrase.<br/><br/>After the round, all players who submitted a phrase card will draw a new card. The player to the left of The Offended becomes the The Offended for the next round. Play continues until one player gets cancelled three times.<br/><br/>&mdash;description from the designer<br/><br/>",

Players will be rolling dice to attempt to become experts in various subject fields and to become the Boss of deals for increasing values of cash. Experts can offer their services to complete a deal for whatever fee they can negotiate with the current Boss, or play cards to affect the outcome of a deal. Whenever a deal is reached, the Boss pays out their agreed-upon money to all who contributed to the deal, and the game ends after 8 deals have been completed. The richest player wins!<br/><br/>Banana Blitz is a trick-taking card game similar to Hearts where players are working to avoid taking Banana cards, but must be careful not to let any one player collect too many in a single hand, lest everyone else suffer a penalty. In addition a small set of Trump cards (that count as Bananas for the purposes of scoring) and two special cards mix up gameplay and force players to think on their feet.<br/><br/>Scope is a game where players compete to try and cross off the most boxes on a grid of numbers, with each player getting an identical grid and using the same set of cards to cross them off. A deck of 20 cards numbered 1-20 are shuffled and five removed at random, and each time a card is flipped players can cross off either a single box matching the number of the card or multiple boxes that sum up to the number, provided they are all vertically/horizontally adjacent. The player who has crossed off the most boxes after all 15 cards have been flipped wins!<br/><br/>",

Sure, it's fun to tell your friends you killed a zombie.  But it's even better to add &quot;Oh, you may have heard of him.&quot;  That's why these zombies are famous.  Will they keep coming back? Most definitely. Will humanity survive? Not even close. But if you can take out a few of the better know walking dead along the way, then you could win.<br/><br/>Game Play:<br/><br/>Players use cards to place player tokens on different spaces.  Placing them on the main board allows players to search for and use weapons to kill and drive back zombies.  The trap area allows your tokens to electrocute or blow up zombies that wander across the board.  Intel spaces allow players to draw additional cards.  The more cards that are drawn, the faster the zombies come.<br/><br/>Zombies are constantly springing up and slowly moving toward the brains on the main board.  When they reach them, players lose player tokens.  Players may regain player tokens by using cards to recruit new allies from the &quot;Eaten&quot; space.<br/><br/>Zombies will come in waves.  Sometimes they give you time to set up your strategy, and sometimes they emerge so quickly and in such large numbers that you must take action immediately.<br/><br/>Famous Zombies is a victory point based game that can be learned quickly and has enough choices to make strategy the most important factor in winning.<br/><br/>",

At the beginning of the game, their choices are rearranging or taking cards from a central display of five cards or taking the top card off the deck.  Finished sets can be laid down at the end of a player&rsquo;s turn.  As the game progresses, players can use their action to pick up a completed tour.  On a subsequent turn they can lay it back down with additional cards to increase the size of that tour.<br/><br/>Wise monkeys, drawn from the deck, allow players to take two different actions in their turn, such as rearranging and then taking from the display.  Wise monkeys can be used immediately or kept for a more convenient time.  Wicked monkeys can also appear from the deck but cause immediate havoc, for example by stealing a wild card from a player&rsquo;s shop front.  Holding fewer cards protects players from certain wicked monkey effects, in which case the monkey is passed to the first eligible player. However, to win you often have to take the risk of holding a large hand.<br/><br/>",

Teams use imagination and quick word-writing wit to create and identify six-word descriptions on more than 1000 different topics.<br/><br/>Can you describe George Washington, Lindsay Lohan or the City of San Francisco in exactly six words? You will need to if you want to win Six-Word Memoirs by University Games. The game invites teams of players to battle for excellence in defining and deciphering famous topics of people and places in exactly six words. For example, do you know who, &ldquo;Julie&rsquo;s mom, wife of Tricky Dicky&rdquo; would be? If you guessed Pat Nixon, then you&rsquo;ve got it.<br/><br/>Six-Word Memoirs is the creation of Larry Smith&rsquo;s online storytelling community, SMITH Magazine. Smith first introduced the concept of describing a person in just six words on his web community and in one of the first Twitter feeds in 2006. He called the form the &ldquo;Six-Word Memoir&rdquo; and this simple way to define a life went on to become New York Times bestselling book, Not Quite What I Was Planning in 2008. Now the wildly popular concept jumps to life in a competitive team-based game.<br/><br/>",

The first player to ship one of their packages from Europe to Games Unlimited wins the game and gains all the gamer glory.<br/><br/>Play: Players take turns shipping either of their 2 packages from Europe to Pittsburgh. Each player rolls the 3 dice up to 3 times. Any die/dice may be set aside each roll, but once set aside, may not be re-rolled. Players are trying to roll combinations of particular dice to match the next transportation type shown on the path: means you must roll three airplanes (6) on the dice to move one package on to that space on the shipment path. Players may choose which shipment path they start on when first shipping a package. After all 3 rolls, the values on the dice may be used to move one or more spaces as long as the number on the space equals the dice rolled. Packages may not be placed on an occupied space.<br/><br/>Wild/Blocker Markers: Players may use the wildcard/blocker markers to do one of two things in the game: <br/>1. As a wildcard, substituting for one of the required dice values desired at any time during the 3 rolls. If you use a wildcard you must give the marker to the other player who then places it on their Transport Track on the space matching the wildcard value (ex. Player 1 uses a wildcard marker sitting on their airplane (6) transport type. They give this marker to Player 2 who then places it on their (6) space. If the transportation space is occupied that player may place it on another transportation type of their choice.<br/>2. As a blocker, placing the marker on any space along any shipment path as long as it matches the color of the transportation type on the shipment path. Any player may remove a blocker by rolling any 3 of a kind and not moving any of their packages. If successful, they place the marker on their Transport Track or (if occupied) on another transportation type of their choice.<br/><br/>If at any time the shipment path splits into several paths, players may choose which path to continue along.<br/><br/>Win: The first player to reach (GU), the Games Unlimited store space in Pittsburgh, with one of their packages, wins the game.<br/><br/>",

The rules are brutally simple and the action is fast-paced! <br/>Punch, kick, and club your opponents-- be the last patron standing to win!<br/><br/>Components: 54 cards, a six sided die<br/><br/>In this game, each player has a character card with two sides: Healthy and Hurt. Each player starts out Healthy, with the Healthy side of the character card face up in front of them.<br/><br/>Each player draws three cards from the deck to form a starting hand. These cards describe various attacks (e.g. Punch, Kick, Uppercut), actions (e.g. Duck, Play Possum), or items (Firewater Bottle, Broken Chair Leg). As the game progresses, players may opt to spend their turn drawing more cards. The goal of the game is to be the last character standing in the saloon.<br/><br/>Players take turns attacking each other as the game proceeds. A punch, for instance, will injure the target on a d6 roll of 5+, while a kick will injure the target on a roll of 4+. If your target is injured, they flip their character card over to the &quot;Hurt&quot; side. If they are injured twice (before being healed), then they are knocked out.<br/><br/>A KO'd character falls to the floor (i.e. they push their character card into the center of the table).

If they do in a minute, they can go again, otherwise the other team has a go. Different categories score differently, whichever team reaches 10 points first, wins. Different to other versions of Pictionary, in this games a card draw decides which category is used by the player, not a die throw.<br/><br/>&mdash;user summary<br/><br/>",

On your turn, you either draw 1 or 2 cards, or pick up one or more cards from the playing area (more on this later). Then you play your sets (3 or 4 cards of same color and value) and runs (3 to 7 consecutive cards of the same color) or increase already played sets and runs. Finally, you must discard a card; special cards are truly discarded once their effects are resolved; the other cards are discarded to the playing area, slightly overlapping each other in sequence. When you pick up a card from the playing area, it must be used to play a run or set and you must pick up any cards that follow it (were discarded after it).<br/><br/>Going out scores a 5-point bonus and ends the round. All played sets and runs score (sets are worth 2 per card; runs are worth 1 per card); cards left in hand penalize you 1 point per card.<br/><br/>The number cards (84) come in 3 colors and run from 1 to 7 (there are four of each). Wild cards (6) can replace any number card but cannot be played to form their own sets or runs. Double cards (3) are used to double the value of all of your sets and runs of a given color. The Special cards (14) do various things such as reshuffling the draw and discard decks, stealing a set, run or double, giving a card away, etc. The Zero Zap card (1), if left in your hand when someone goes out, zaps your score for that round to zero (Yikes!). However, if played as a Special to go out, it zaps someone else's (of your choosing) round score!<br/><br/>",

The hand cards are used when racing against opponents (in the form of car cards) or other players.<br/><br/>When racing, first you pick the track to race on (drag race, Mulholland Drive, or Aqueduct Race). Next, determine your score on the chosen track based on the cards in your hand. The player with the highest score has the best chance to win -- but luck factors into the equation. Draw the next card from the deck and check the Bad Luck number to see whether you won the race or not.<br/><br/>The player who beats The King, the best opponent in the deck, wins the game!<br/><br/>",

Aside from building the bank itself, they set up patrol routes for guards to ensure that the robbers never face the same bank twice. Once the bank blueprint is set, it needs a state-of-the-art security system that will prove impossible to defeat...or so the bank hopes.<br/><br/>The robber's job is to pick apart those carefully planned defenses by assembling a crew of specialists and equipping them with the tools and weapons they'll need. Robbers can choose to scout out the bank's security or go straight in for a quick smash-and-grab heist. Robbers choose which game mode to play: co-op (working together against the bank), semi co-op (kind of working together against the bank), or competitively (pretending to work together, but shooting each other in the back).<br/><br/>",

        "description": "Moon &amp; Sun Druids select a new leader by moving around the circles of stones. A mix of cards and dice and symbols.<br/><br/>The Druids start from the Grove, in the centre of the Stone Circle. When a player begins his turn, he must move his druid, firstly, onto one of the 6 stones showing a Pentagram. This is the only space that may be moved to, from the centre area. The player throws both dice. At the beginning of the game each player has only one piece available (his Druid), therefore only one of the dice is used to determine movement. The second dice is unused until such time as the player has other game-pieces available for him to move. The meaning of the symbols on the dice dictate the type of movement allowed.<br/>The space on which a Druid lands also affects further events. After the player has carried out all necessary actions then his turn is over. If a Druid lands on a blank stone then his turn is immediately ended and play passes to the next player.<br/> Once a player has taken control of two or more pieces then he may apply the dice to their full potential. In this case a player can, for example, move two Spirits or one Spirit and one Druid. Naturally he will choose the optimum moves, considering the symbols on the stones and the location of other game pieces, which each piece can land on.<br/>The player with the most points, overall, wins the game and is proclaimed the new High-Druid.<br/><br/>",

        "description": "After the well-known children's book &quot;Guess how much I love you&quot; by Sam McBratney and Anita Jeram, Kosmos now also presents the matching game to the children's book. Just like in the book, it has to be estimated how much the little rabbit loves the big rabbit.<br/><br/>Before the game starts, the hare figure is assembled and placed in front of the oldest player. The cords are placed in front of the oldest players. The bunny cards come in the middle of the board and the game can start.<br/><br/>The game is played in rounds. First of all, all players - except for the player who is just the &quot;little rabbit&quot; - close their eyes. The &quot;little bunny&quot; then pulls a string and attaches it to the rabbit figure. In the first round, the oldest player is the &quot;little rabbit&quot;, then always the next player in a clockwise direction. If the &quot;little bunny&quot; has attached the string, he calls &quot;Guess how much I love you&quot; and all players are allowed to open their eyes.<br/><br/>Players now need to assess the length of the string that the &quot;little rabbit&quot; has chosen. The players grab as quickly as possible one of the rabbit cards from the middle, on which always a string is shown. Of course, each string on each rabbit card has a different length, of course, if possible, you should choose the rabbit card with the right string length.<br/><br/>Once each player has taken a card, the &quot;little rabbit&quot; now determines which player has taken the right one. He takes the cord and places it on the respective cards. If a player chooses the right rabbit card, he gets a chip for it. If no player has chosen a correct card, the &quot;little bunny&quot; himself gets the chip. The cards come back to the middle of the table, as well as the string. Then the player to the left of the previous &quot;little rabbit&quot; is the new &quot;little rabbit&quot; and the next round begins.<br/><br/>The game ends as soon as a player has collected three chips. This player then automatically wins the game.<br/><br/>A variant suggests that players can earn an extra chip once they get the right string length and then ask, &quot;Do you really know how much I love you?&quot; as original as possible. As another alternative, the chip can only be awarded for the correct string length if the player brings an original explanation that no other player had before.<br/><br/>",

It may seem similar to other games, but Bones has a unique aspect that makes game play very different from what you might expect!  Can you deal with the overlapping of pieces better than your opponent?<br/><br/>The game is played on a 9x12 grid, with pieces that measure 1x2; each player gets a set of 18 pieces, but more can be made if necessary.  The first tile must be played so it occupies part of the middle; later tiles can be played anywhere as long as they're entirely within the playing area and as long as it does not cover up an already played tile in one move (in other words, it's OK to cover a tile completely, but this must be done in two turns).<br/><br/>",

Mexican troops under President General Antonio L&oacute;pez de Santa Anna started a 13-day siege, reclaiming the Alamo Mission near San Antonio de B&eacute;xar (modern-day San Antonio, Texas, United States), Santa Anna's refusal to take prisoners during the battle, killing most of the occupants inside, inspired many Texians and Tejanos to join the Texian Army. Motivated by their written desire to preserve a border open to immigration, and a desire for revenge, the Texians defeated the Mexican Army at the Battle of San Jacinto, on April 21, 1836, ending the rebellion in favor of the newly formed Republic of Texas.<br/><br/>&mdash;description from the publisher<br/><br/>",

Wizardry would allow them to change the size of the stone. The winner was the first to get his gem around the course.<br/><br/>The square tiles with the small gem are the game pieces. For each gem there are 4 different sizes. Each player has only one of the stones on the board at a time.<br/><br/>On a turn, a player moves his stone according to the size of the stone. The tile moves as many space in one direction as the size of the stone. Players can change the size of their stones during their turns. Stones that meet bump each other. The chasm is impassable, so players must build bridges across the chasm. 12 bridge pieces in 2 colors are included.<br/><br/>Spell cards can change or move the bridges. Bridges are also the start and ending spaces for each stone.<br/><br/>",

The first player to get rid of all his marbles is the winner.<br/><br/>The catch is, that because the marbles are unevenly magnetic, if you are not careful when you put a marble on the board, sometimes you will cause some (or even many) of the marbles to become attracted to each other. Any marbles that suffer this fate have to removed by the player causing the attraction, and added to his pool of marbles.<br/><br/>The game comes with suggestions for various alternative versions of the game.<br/><br/>Action Attraction can be played solo.<br/><br/>The game has two different skill levels which are switched between by movement of a lever on the underside of the board.<br/><br/>French title: MAGNET'O'BILLES<br/>Dutch title: Actie Attractie<br/><br/>",

Instead there are mining licenses (for magnetites, platinum, diamonds and uranium) and players may build mines on appropriate areas.There are also 3 transportation bases and players may build communication lines there.<br/><br/>",

        "description": "Royal Marriage is a solitaire game played with a standard 52-card poker deck, dating from the 19th century or earlier. Players seek to reunite the Queen of Hearts, at one end of the deck, with her King, at the other, by eliminating all other cards.<br/><br/>To set up a game, the King and Queen of Hearts are removed from a deck, which is then shuffled. Afterwards, the King is placed on the bottom and the Queen placed on top. Cards are dealt, one by one, from the top of the deck and played next to the Queen, forming a row that allows all cards to be seen at once.<br/><br/>Cards can be removed one or two at a time, but only when they are bookended by two cards of either the same suit or rank. If all cards save the Queen and King are eliminated, the game is won; if cards remain and no further moves can be made, the game is lost.<br/><br/>Strategy comes in the form of hand management, deciding which cards to eliminate and when. Immediately discarding cards whenever possible is likely to lead to a loss; rather, cards that can easily be eliminated later -- such as those of the same suit as the King and Queen -- are often better to keep, in case they can be paired up later with other cards to eliminate some stubborn holdouts. Success or failure often depends on which cards the player can manage to hold on to for later use.<br/><br/>Royal Marriage can be played on a table or entirely in-hand. To play the latter, the King is placed on the top of the deck face-down, while the Queen is placed on top of the King face-up. Cards are then dealt from the bottom of the deck onto the Queen, and fanned out to show available moves.<br/><br/>&mdash;user summary<br/><br/>",

This is why it is not only mind and strategy that count in Dice Club but also the strength of muscles.<br/><br/>The game involves 3 to 6 players. The players play 2 rounds. Each round is divided into 2 phases &ndash; a poker phase and a fighting (brawl) phase. In the first phase, you should get the best possible set consisting of 6 dice. In the second phase, fists are flying and there is a clash at the arena (ring). A player who will get the highest score after 2 rounds wins.

The oldest player starts and tries to find a<br/>matching pair of numbers.<br/>Uncover two cards one by one and announce the number represented.<br/>&bull; Both cards show a matching pair of numbers?<br/>Well done! Take the cards. Then uncover two more cards.<br/>&bull; The two cards don't show a matching pair of numbers:<br/>Pity! Let the others see the cards and turn them back over again. Then<br/>it's the turn of the next player to turn over two cards.<br/><br/>End of the Game<br/><br/>The game ends as soon as all the matching pairs of numbers have been<br/>collected. Pile up your cards: whoever has the highest pile, wins the<br/>game.<br/>Variation for younger children<br/>&bull; Select any two sets of cards with ten cards each and play Clever Bear<br/>Memory.<br/>&bull; Select all cards of a specific range of numbers: for example all cards<br/>representing the numbers One to Five.<br/><br/>",

No radio show hosting, no paragliding, no unicycle riding: the lives of our ancient ancestors were utilitarian and boring &ndash; or were they?<br/><br/>Designer Roberto Fraga doesn't think so, as in Mammut Mambo he introduces (or reintroduces?) gamers to a caveman dance craze. Each round card after card is added to the playing area, introducing more quirky gestures and moves to those already in play, creating a dance that all players must perform simultaneously. If you fail to keep the beat, you receive all the cards in play as punishment. What's more, the best mammoth-hunting clan chief gets to push his cards on another player. Whoever can best keep their head &ndash; and their rhythm &ndash; in all the confusion will win.<br/><br/>",

On a player's turn he rolls a special die and plays one or more small tiles showing snake body parts to either his own snake or to his left-hand neighbor's snake.  How many tiles he plays and to which snake he plays the tiles depends on the roll of the special die.  The body tiles can contain turns, crossovers, and twists which can extend the distance your neighbor needs to cover to complete his snake.  But if the tile you select to play on your neighbor can't fit, it comes back to you!<br/><br/>",

The game takes place in the year 3026, where religion has been outlawed and a small band of underground patriots called &quot;The Remnant&quot; discover the secrets of time travel. Players must play cards to travel back in time to the &quot;Age of Apostles&quot;, visit a Biblical city, record an event on a data cell, and return to the future.<br/><br/>You play Advance and Event Chain cards on a colorful game board which details your progress. Your opponent tries to stop you by playing Obstacle cards. Both players have access to power cells and other enhancement cards which of course have a variety of special abilities that change the course of the game. The first one to complete your three Event Chains and play the TIMESTREAM card wins the game!<br/><br/>",

A hex grid is printed over the warrior's body. In the course of the duel, players will position their shield over some hexes (a portion of their warrior's body).  Depending on the action they select for the turn, they may also position their sword over hexes on their own warrior's body (for a parry) or may point it at some part of the opponent's warrior to make an attack. The actions and positions chosen will result in various outcomes, which may include inflicting damage to the opposing warrior.<br/><br/>The game includes plastic swords of the same sort that are used as swizzle sticks in mixed drinks.<br/><br/>",

Extreme weather is expected, accompanied by even more extreme photographers. Speed, split-second timing, calculated risk-taking and outsmarting the competition are your tickets to victory!<br/><br/>Original version: Object of the game from the first page of rulebook:<br/><br/>The players compete for three rounds then see who, on average, has taken the best tornado photos. The higher the number of points from the photos, the better. The higher the number of card, the more dangerous the photographer's location depicted, so it's important to make the right decisions during the game. At the end of each round, the players determine their average score of the photos taken in their points pile using the averages table. Each round ends when the Game Over card is picked up. After the third round, each player's lowest average score of the three is selected and the player with the highest of these lowest scores is the winner.<br/><br/>Second Edition changes game as follows:<br/><br/>Players no more try to get highest average during three rounds. Instead, they try to get as much points as possible during each round and players can play any number of rounds as well. This makes averages table obsolete in second edition. Some card functions are also streamlined to make game play faster and more intuitive. Rules of the second edition are only in english and finnish.<br/><br/>The game box contains:<br/><br/>75 cards (21 different types of)<br/>15 +1/-1 markers<br/>1 two-sided score table<br/>1 score pad (50 pages)<br/>Includes German, French, English, Dutch, Swedish and Finnish rules.<br/><br/>",

        "description": "The Battle of Waterloo is a simple wargame made by Palitoy. The board is a stylised schematic representation of the battle field which has a 'Snakes and Ladders' feel to it. The units move by die roll along a number of tracks which represent historical key points/targets in the battle. Along each track there are 'quasi historical' events which can either aid or impede the advance of your forces. Some advance you nearer your goal others either send you back or eliminate the unit.<br/><br/>The object of the game is to have the most points remaining upon the board at game end which can be triggered in a number of ways. Different types of units are valued accordingly so artillery are worth 6 points, cavalry 4 points and infantry 1 point.<br/><br/>The units are plastic figures representing the forces present at Waterloo; a small head and upper torso represents the infantry, a horse head represents the cavlary and artillery are represented by small cannons.<br/><br/>The game consists of the board, a rules pamphlet which includes historical detail and illustrations about the battle, a die and the following pieces:<br/><br/>2 red Allied cannon<br/>6 red Allied cavalry<br/>10 red Allied infantry<br/><br/>3 blue French cannon<br/>7 blue French cavalry<br/>8 blue French infantry<br/><br/>A sister game in the series was also produced on The Battle of Balaclava also designed by Malcolm Greensmith.<br/><br/>",

Players form 2 teams, in which they write down words and try to describe them to their teammates as quickly as possible, but must abide by the rules and the challenges of the Abla-ublas, like speaking with their tongue hanging out their mouth or keep their teeth clenched together while talking, in order to work out what on earth their team-mates are trying to describe! The game contains 85 Category cards that can be erased when filled up and 15 Challenge cards that will keep players excited for a long time! There are 2 modes that we can use the Challenge cards, for even greater replayability. The team with the most Victory Points wins the game.

The players go around the board, but which leg of the board they're allowed on depends on how far they've risen in the hierarchy yet.  The most visible status symbol is your apartment size --and the competition for the one and only full-size Dacha can be ferocious.  There are a number of other status perks, such as use of the State Car.  All in all, a very amusing game that actually does capture a fair amount of the flavour of life in the communist USSR before its fall.<br/><br/>The game was invented by Harley Sachs in 1969 under the name POLICE STATE, and sold in England and the USA, even as far as Ireland and South America.  It was copyrighted, patented, and published by the IDEA DEVELOPMENT COMPANY (IDEVCO), licensed by Gameophiles and later by the L.A. Producers' Partnership under the name COMRADES.<br/><br/>It got his second name COMRADES from a BBC documentary series (1983-84), which aired in 1986 in the US. The documentary was about the life of ordinary Soviet citizens, which got interviewed by the producer Richard Denton.<br/><br/>",

Like pachisi, and unlike backgammon, everyone moves in the same direction. Two cones of the same color on one space are safe, however a single cone can be &quot;captured&quot;. When you land on a space with only one cone of another player on it, you stack your cone on top of it and trap it. Until you move that cone again, her cone can't move.<br/><br/>&quot;A captivating game for two-four players that can be played in 30-60 minutes.&quot;<br/><br/><br/>",

The game continues until one nation has dominated the world or there is a stalemate with the entire industrial production of the world reduced to rubble.<br/><br/>Near the turn of the 19th century, there was a significant shift in the way war was conducted. Prior to this time, war was waged between the armies of nations, while the general populace and the largely agrarian economies of the nations involved were affected indirectly. The onset of the industrial revolution provided new weapons of such variety, power and cost that those who waged war could no longer afford to ignore the economies and the peoples they warred against. At this time, the scope of war expanded to include every facet of a nation&rsquo;s ability to produce. War in its various forms spilled over the battlefields and into the factories and lives of everyone. This new kind of war took place on a scale never before seen with weapons never before imagined. This was the dawn of &ldquo;Total War&rdquo;.<br/><br/>",

Each successful shot is worth ten points, but also more often than not gives the quaffle to your opponent. With eight quaffles flying back and forth, though, there's plenty to go around!<br/>At a random point in the contest, the game will launch a gold ping-pong-esque ball - the Golden Snitch -  into the air. Whichever player catches the ball is awarded 150 points, and the game ends.<br/>The game, which runs on two C batteries, provides sound effects during the game and also keeps track of the score, which can get into the thousands.<br/><br/>",

A small car (the 'Demon') that relies on a ball bearing for mobility is placed behind the gate which is released by an opponent when all the targets are in position.<br/><br/>The instructions describe several variations of the game but all basically involve bumping into as many of the target cars with the Demon as possible and returning to the Pits before the timing gate closes.<br/><br/>",

The objective is to help the Scentons recapture the Elemons by battling it out against other players to discover the powers of the Elemons. Scentons need your help to capture the lost and scattered Elemons from the far corners of our universe! Discover the powers of their elemental cores before your opponents do...<br/><br/>Elemons: STATE MODE Battle Game, a two-player game featuring creatures based on the elements of the periodic table, contains 49 cards consisting of two sets of 12 unique Elemon creatures plus 12 Temperature cards and a battle area rule card. The two sets have orange and purple card backs. The STATE MODE Battle Game is based on using the three states of the elements ie solid/liquid/gas. Gameplay focuses on adapting the rock/paper/scissors to the three states but with a twist. Each play can heat or cool each Elemon's state using the Temperature cards. The winner is the one who captures ten opposing Elemons.<br/><br/>",

Every sequence must conform to one of the two rules:<br/><br/>First rule:<br/>If the sequence has 3 or more numbers, every number is the sum of the previous two numbers - but we only use the last digit of the sum. For example, if the previous two numbers are 6 and 7 then since 6 + 7 = 13 the next number must be 3 (we ignore the first digit, &quot;1&quot;). Other valid Yushino sequences are 875, since 8 + 7 =(1)5; 7291, as 7 + 2 = 9 and 2 + 9 = (1)1, etc.<br/><br/>Second rule:<br/>If the sequence has 2 numbers, the numbers must differ by 1 - but keep in mind that the numbers repeat, so we go from 0 to 9 and then back to 0 again, which means that 9 is next to 8 but it is also next to 0. Examples of valid two-number sequences are: 56, 87, 90, 09, 98, etc.<br/><br/>",

In this fast-paced educational game, ABC shooters take up the pursuit of the greedy rodent and learn very easily how to read and understand texts.<br/><br/>To stop the voracious reading rat, all players have to read different task cards together. If they have understood the text correctly, they can slide the matching images together on the Turn game board. However, this must be done before the rat has gnawed its way through the shelf. Reading beginners from the age of 6 are just right here. The tasks come in two difficulty levels, so this entertaining learning game can be improved from time to time.<br/>In the race against the reading rat, children immerse themselves in the world of letters, words and their pronunciation. This makes the game a welcome addition to school learning or the ideal preparation for it. Its great pedagogical value derives from the use of the Mildenberger syllable method, which has proven its worth many times over. The syllables highlighted in colour on the text cards lead to a faster comprehension of a word. If it is read syllable by syllable, a word sounds as we have heard it before. Children learn in this way spielerisch that reading makes fun and is not at all so difficult.<br/><br/>Great reading fun with pedagogical demands<br/><br/><br/>     Improves text comprehension in scalable difficulty levels<br/>     Increases the joy of learning and motivates teamwork<br/>     According to the syllable method of Mildenberger<br/><br/><br/>&mdash;description from the publisher (translated)<br/><br/>Im spannenden Wettlauf das Lesen lernen: Wer huscht denn da verstohlen durchs B&uuml;cherregal und knabbert alle Seiten an? Nat&uuml;rlich eine Lese-Ratte! Bei diesem rasanten Lernspiel nehmen ABC-Sch&uuml;tzen die Verfolgung des gierigen Nagetiers auf und lernen kinderleicht, wie das geht mit dem Lesen und Verstehen von Texten.<br/><br/>Um die gefr&auml;&szlig;ige Lese-Ratte zu stoppen, m&uuml;ssen alle Spieler zusammen verschiedene Aufgabenkarten lesen. Wenn sie den Text richtig verstanden haben, k&ouml;nnen sie die passenden Bilder auf dem Wende-Spielplan zusammenschieben. Das muss allerdings gelingen, bevor sich die Ratte durchs Regal genagt hat. Lese-Einsteiger ab 6 Jahren sind hier genau richtig. Die Aufgaben gibt es in zwei Schwierigkeitsstufen, sodass sich dieses unterhaltsame Lernspiel von Mal zu Mal steigern l&auml;sst.<br/>Beim Wettlauf mit der Lese-Ratte tauchen Kinder tief in die Welt der Buchstaben, W&ouml;rter und ihrer Aussprache ein. Damit ist das Spiel eine willkommene Erg&auml;nzung zum schulischen Lernen oder die ideale Vorbereitung darauf. Seinen gro&szlig;en p&auml;dagogischen Wert erh&auml;lt es aus der Anwendung der vielfach bew&auml;hrten Mildenberger Silbenmethode. Die auf den Textkarten farbig hervorgehobenen Silben f&uuml;hren zum schnelleren Erfassen eines Wortes.

The players take turns to place a bottle cap face down on the board. Under each cap, a disk with a faction symbol is attached by magnet. The faction may be that of you or your opponent. Since the bottle caps are placed face down, the players do not know which symbols their opponents have placed. The object of this game is to connect the opposite sides of your color with your symbols. There are two ways to obstruct your opponent's moves. One is to place your symbol on your opponent's route to block it. The other is to &quot;attack&quot;. To attack, choose and reveal 3 facedown bottle caps, and if all three have the same symbols, remove them from the board. Thus, it is highly risky to simply place caps with your symbol in a straight line to connect your sides, because the caps may be attacked and removed by your opponent!<br/><br/>-description from designer<br/><br/>",

El joc de cartes is a trick-taking card game loosely based on the novel Victus by Albert S&agrave;nchez Pi&ntilde;ol and set during the siege of Barcelona of 1713-1714, the last act of the War of the Spanish Succession.<br/><br/>In the game, players play the role of the main characters of the novel, divided in two sides: the Catalans defending Barcelona (Mart&iacute; Zuviria and Antoni de Villarroel), and the French-Spanish army storming the city (Berwick, Popoli and van Verboom). The only player whose identity is public is Zuviria, the other characters are hidden until one of them decides to show himself or until some cards force them to do so. Each trick is won by the player who has played the first card of the suit with most points. But some additional character cards can change the rules for winning a trick in some rounds.<br/><br/>After the last trick, each side adds up their points: for each color (not to be confused with the suits), two points for the side with most cards of that color; and 3 points for the side which has more completed &quot;VICTUS&quot; words (each card has also a letter from the word VICTUS).<br/><br/>",

It was later self-published again as Arbitrage.<br/><br/>A description of Arbitrage:<br/><br/>Arbitrage (HC Jacoby Inc) is a stock market and corporate manipulation board game. The board is a Monopoly type with the movement track around the edge, with the middle taken up mostly by price tracks for the 6 corporations in the game. Each corporation has 3 spaces in a row on the outside track that counts as its home. Then there are a few other spaces that allow specific actions like buying/selling mutual funds, draw a random event, or draw a stock manipulation card. Stocks are bought by landing on one of the 3 spaces of a corporation's home, or by landing on a mutual fund space. If you own 3 stocks of a corporation, you become its president and can either pay out dividends to stockholders, or you can merge corporations, thus increasing stock prices. Other things that can happen are 'takeovers' - forcing a resident to sell you his shares, or 'options' - a chance to buy shares from the bank (or another player for 1/2 price). Trading of shares between players at any time is also encouraged. The game ends after a set amount of time, or when a player goes bankrupt.<br/><br/>Movement around the board is accomplished with 3 dice (2 regular d6, and 1 special die which has symbols on it to move stock prices either up or down). A player's turn consists of rolling the three dice, moving his marker to the new space, manipulating a stock price up or down by the die roll, then performing the action on the space where you landed (if any).<br/><br/>",

Cards are given to the main player in secret, whom then reads them aloud and chooses the best one and owner of this card scores the point.<br/><br/>After that all players that used orange cards draws new ones (so they have 10 again) and the next player become the main player and the cycle continues. After one of the decks become empty players stop the game, they count their score (1 black cards = 1 point) and the winner is a player with the higher score.<br/><br/>All cards have phrases printed in english and polish language both.<br/><br/>",

Each player sits at a long edge and starts with his nine frogs (hollow plastic figurines, 7 cm along their largest dimension) filling that row.  All frogs move like Chess knights.  Light moves first.  Capture is by landing on an opposing frog and is not mandatory.  The object of the game is to line up three frogs horizontally, vertically or diagonally in the Arena in such a way that the opponent cannot break it up (by capture) on his next move.  A draw occurs when both players are down to two frogs.<br/><br/>In advanced play, a frog that captures gets to move again, sort of like in Checkers.  Other variations allowed include different starting dispositions (any can be used as long as they are player-symmetrical).  Finally, the &quot;alternate win&quot; rule states that you can also win by reducing the opponent to two frogs.<br/><br/>",

They line up their caterpillars, then place additional half-spheres upside down as food at different lengths on the table, with the final row of food equalling the finish line.<br/><br/>On a turn, a player rolls the three color dice up to three times, keeping whichever dice they want after each throw.

        "description": "From the Italian company International Team comes this fairly simple game of piracy on the high seas.<br/><br/>On a map that can only be considered a fantasy world you sail your galleon around the outer islands picking up treasure chests in the hope of delivering the treasures to his island in the middle of the board.<br/><br/>Movement is handled by way of a wind disk. Every 3 turns this disk turns and the wind will be coming from a new direction. A ship always moves in a straight line that can be at a diagonal. If it is sailing in the direction of the wind it must move 4 spaces. If in a diagonal with the wind it must move 5 spaces. If perpendicular to the wind movement is 3 spaces. If diagonal against the wind movement is 2 spaces and if against the wind 1 space. The wind rotates in a rigid sequence so you can always plan what your ship will be doing. If a ship runs onto land it is sunk. A ship can stop short of its full movement if it is in a harbor square of which each island has one. On the outer islands this is where a galleon picks up treasures and each may carry up to 3. The board wraps around on itself so if a ship sails off an edge it reappears on the opposite side of the board.<br/><br/>There are 6 dark areas on the seas that can become storms. The start player rolls 2 die at the beginning of his turn and puts a marker on the corresponding areas. Ships cannot enter these and ships that are in these areas cannot move.<br/><br/>Each player also has a frigate. Frigates attempt to pass over another ship, regardless of the type, which will sink it. A sunken ship will always reappear at that player&rsquo;s island at the start of his next turn. Frigates may not dock at harbors so they cannot end their movement short when passing over one. Ships sunk have their treasures returned to the bank.<br/><br/>You play until a player has collected an agreed to amount of treasures. The rules suggest 8 to 20.<br/><br/>The rules take up 3 small pages of which half the page is rules in another language. There are also 4 illustrations in the rules so you end up with about 1 page of rules. Some things are very vague though. How the Disk of Winds is used is not very clear. Here logic can get you through. The islands in the center are not marked as belonging to anyone so I have always had each player put a treasure on one to claim it. We have also played that the islands belong to no one player and you just need to get you treasures to an island. This makes it a lot easier to dock and drop off treasures.<br/><br/>",

Led by Gil-Galad, the Elven King, and the high King of Men, Elendil, the Army of the Last Alliance decisively defeated the Dark Lord (Sauron) in the battle of Celebrant. Sauron (and presumably his evil servants, the Nazgul, said by some to be his children) fled to his Fortress-Prison, the Barad-Dur, or Dark Tower. It withstood a Seven Year Siege, and then fell when hunger swept the ranks of the Orcs (the Army of Sauron mostly consisted of these creatures. They came in assorted sizes, had leathery hide and unpleasant temper, and would soon kill each other as the enemy but for the powerful leadership of Sauron) and reduced the garrison to a point of being too weak to hold of fort. The final weeks of this siege and the final assault from the subject of this game.<br/><br/>The Siege of Barad-Dur appeared in issue JagdPanther magazine #8, 15 January 1975, with PQ-17.

        "description": "From Peter Funk, the writer of the &quot;It Pays To Increase Your Word Power&quot; column from the American magazine _Reader's Digest_, comes this game, a Trivial-Pursuit-style affair that tests players' knowledge of words and their meanings.  At the beginning of the game, players select a category of vocabulary, and for the remainder of the game they will be asked to define words from that subject.  The six categories are &quot;Romantic Souls&quot; (words from the arts and humanities), &quot;Sports Nuts&quot; (sports, recreation, and the outdoors), &quot;Mad Scientists&quot; (physical and social sciences), &quot;Big Bosses&quot; (business, commerce and government), &quot;Globe Trotters&quot; (geography, history, and culture), and &quot;Know It All&quot; (general and miscellaneous).  The game itself is a race around a track; players move their pawns around the board by correctly answering questions, with more difficult questions allowing faster progress.  The rules also include many game variants, from solitaire to group play.<br/><br/>",

Once each turn its movement is dictated by the turning of a card with N/S and/or W/E and the number of squares to be moved.  Player (hound)movement is controlled by a spinner allowing one of: N/S/W/E or diagonal movement, diagonal direction chosen by the player. The 15 square by 15 square board has 20 red squares that allow a player, that ends his/her spinner-controlled movement on one, to move 2 squares in either N/S/W or E, chosen by the player. Fox landing on a hound, hound landing on hound, or hound being directed off the edge of the board results in the hound being returned to the center square and, in the first and third situation just described, lose a turn.<br/><br/>",

The game is played over twelve rounds, representing the twelve chimes of midnight.  On a round a player must perform any combination of three actions from a total of four possibles or pass, discard and refill. Essentially the actions are place scoring cards (deliver presents) or interfere with your opponents' deliveries. Event cards turn up which affect everyone immediately.  The winner is the player who after the twelfth chime has the highest total of present points in his display, with rules for tie-breaks. A variant is suggested giving a variable game length by shuffling the &quot;chime cards&quot; into the deck.<br/><br/>By the way, despite the curious title, the game is perfectly suitable for family play!<br/><br/>Home Page : <a target='_blank' href=\"http://www.monpetitcoin.com/createurs/xmas/\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer noopener\">http://www.monpetitcoin.com/createurs/xmas/</a><br/><br/>",

The origin of the conflict dated back to the beginning of the instrumental exploration of the system in the last decades of the 20th century. A band of five Altair planets was found to be rich in rich in raw materials in short supply among certain planets in nearby stellar systems.  Planets from three such stars began immediate plans for colonization and exploitation.<br/><br/>At the games beginning, the invading planets have each established a base of operations and, recognizing the threat from each other, have launched a fleet of three immense &quot;Command Ships&quot; to further colonize, defend and conquer the Altair system.<br/><br/>Now, THE WAR OF THE WORLDS II allows you to recreate this classic campaign in the depths of space. Two or three players, each taking the role of Commander-in-Chief of an invading fleet, use the mapboard, 86 counters, and rules of play, to replay future history.&quot;<br/><br/>",

        "description": "From the Publisher:<br/><br/>SIX GENERATIONS. This is an educational card game for people of all ages, children and adults. One to 12 players create a family tree of 64 characters spanning six generations. Each character is &quot;born&quot; into the game with his or her own story of genealogy, ancestors and matchmaking. Players will learn 72 most popular male and female first names, look at ethnic costumes of Europeans and Americans and memorize 20 European countries and regions.<br/>     The game SIX GENERATIONS follows the history of the United States in the 19th and 20th centuries' period of European immigration. The number of stars on the American flag increases as the nation grows. Children will realize how many ancestors (62!) lived through just the last five generations to make their own life happen!<br/>     The game represents six generations of a family who came from Europe to the United States in the first half of the 19th century. The latest generation consists of Emily and Jacob, brother and sister living in the United States of 2005. As the cards are played, five generations of Emily and Jacob's ancestors will appear.<br/>     Players are dealt 6 cards each and take turns to add a person to the family tree, starting from the European generation and adding descendants, and drawing cards when unable to play.<br/><br/>",

The battle itself uses some very interesting, colorful terrain, along with the usual units with the evocative names: 2nd Zouaves, the Fijo de Morelio Battalion, Chasseurs d&rsquo;Affrique, the Oaxaca Lancers, etc. Special rules cover cavalry lancer charges, square formation, a rather early use of trenches, and artillery ammo.<br/><br/>Most of the rules and mechanics will be quite familiar to anyone who has played BSO games, but all with a nice period flavor.<br/><br/>Playing time for CINCO has averaged 2-3 hours, sometimes less, and the rules are only 9 pages.<br/><br/>CAVEAT: This battle will also be featured in an upcoming GMT module (for their GRINGO game) that will be published late 2007, early 2008. It uses a totally different more complex system, though<br/><br/>Each game of CINCO DE MAYO includes Rules, one sheet of Mike Lemick&rsquo;s great-looking cut-and-paste counters, and a colorful Pascal da Silva 22&rdquo;x17&rdquo; game map and game cover.<br/><br/>",

One player (or team) controls the Massive side, a single nigh unstoppable unit. The other controls the Masses, a large army of varied units trying to bring the Massive side down. Each game in The Massive Vs. The Masses line features a sensible pairing of forces in a totally self-contained game, but they can all be combined for team games, or just for when you want to pit a giant atomic monster against an army of mole men for a change of pace.<br/><br/>The bulk of the gameplay consists of moving units around a hex-grid board, attacking other units, or notable features of the terrain itself, but each turn, players play cards to enable special one-time attacks, create new units, give bonuses to units, activate set-specific weak points, and other various effects.<br/><br/>",

When this happens, the player has three choices at the beginning of the next turn.  To continue on, to reverse direction and move, or to roll the Die of Power; the Die of Power may cause you to lose your turn, reclaim an energy disk, move 5 spaces or teleport to any space, designate another player to lose a disk, or let you become the Turbo Cochon (Pig), who teleports, forces another player to lose an energy disk, and collects that disk all in one fell swoop.

Players are also dealt inspectors who come in two different forms. Authorised inspectors are easier to spot but will still slap you with a hefty fine. Then there's undercover inspectors -They're the ones you need to keep an eye out for as they'll pop up in the most unlikely of places.<br/><br/>Things can get out of hand when power cards come into play which are randomly drawn throughout the game. They'll give you abilities like switching the game to any lane or protecting yourself from the next player's move. How far can you push your luck? Can you spot the undercover inspector among the crowd? Can you ride the tram to safety? You never know what's around that tram track, Ben, so make sure you've touched on.<br/><br/>",

A card can be played on a stack if it is the same number or if it shares a color with the top card and is higher. A stack can be claimed if it is a player's turn and his card is on top of stack. After all cards have been played, points are scored based on the number of cards players have claimed. The player with the most points wins.<br/>____________<br/>This is not a separately sold game . These 33 cards are an addition to the Classic edition of Fang den Hut!. They only were included in this special 2005 version !<br/><br/>",

As an extra bonus for matching form you can take another turn.<br/><br/>Since a player has a hand limit of 4 cards you will most likely need to place cards back in the tableau in order to collect a full set of 4 cards which form a dragon. Different color dragons are of different rarity and also score a different amount of points.

At the time I just threw some words from Jabberwocky into the dialog to make it seem like a weird, fun game. Many readers expressed interest in actually playing Borogove, so I sat down and started to create a game.

Players choose a side at the beginning of the game, with at least 1 player representing each faction.  Players have a hand of 5 cards featuring fighter cards (depicting famous Pirates or Ninjas), weapon cards, ability cards, and ambush cards.<br/><br/>After sides have been selected, players initiate a &quot;draw&quot; round where each player draws two cards and may then  take two actions, including playing a fighter from their faction, a weapon on a fighter already in play on their side, an ability on a fighter, or they may discard up to two cards and draw replacements.  Play passes to the left.<br/><br/>After all players have drawn and played cards, a &quot;battle&quot; round begins where all fighters enter into a battle for supremacy.  The total number of fighters for each player is determined by the lowest number that player controls.  After fighters have been selected the first player may choose to activate an ability or play an ambush card from his or her hand affecting the battle.  This continues until all players have decided to pass.  All players total their attack value for all fighters involved in battle the highest total earns that player a victory point (6 are needed to win).  Then all players roll a die to determine casualties.  If a die roll matches an opponent's fighter, that fighter is discarded from play and the die roller earns a victory point.<br/><br/>After battle, a draw phase starts again.<br/><br/>",

        "description": "A simple card game of empire-building rivalry.<br/><br/>There are some 15 territory cards rated 1 through 3, some of which are dealt out to the players at the start (each gets a 1 and a 2 territory).  There are Revolt and Cannon cards.  The remaining cards are Development cards, each rated from 1 to 6.  On your turn, you draw a card and play or discard one.  The deck of a little over a hundred cards is played through and then everyone scores.  Once the deck is exhausted, play continues until everyone's hand is also exhausted.  Once your hand drops below four cards, there are some limitations on card play that come into effect.<br/><br/>When developing a Territory you own, you ideally would play a 1, then a 2, and so on up to a 6.  The developments must be played in increasing numerical sequence, but they need not be consecutive.  At the end of the game, a territory scores the number of development cards on it times its basic multiplier (1&times;, 2&times; or 3&times;) - so an undeveloped territory is worthless.  If you managed to have a sequence of at least four consecutive developments on the territory, you score a sizable bonus.<br/><br/>Revolt cards prevent a territory from being developed or attacked; they also cancel an existing revolt card (there are only 8 of those in the deck).  It is sometimes good strategy to play a revolt on a territory of your own to prevent it from being attacked.<br/><br/>Cannon cards are used to attack other players' territories; you play a cannon face down, and so does the defender.  Both reveal their cards and add a die roll.  The attacker's total must beat the defender's for the attack to succeed.  When it does, you roll a die and this indicates how many cards you plunder from that territory.  If that roll is high enough, you can even steal the territory itself.  Plundered cards must be allocated to your territories right away or discarded.<br/><br/>Cannon can also be used, if rated four or better, to empty one of your territories from its development cards so as to redeploy them - in effect, you are raiding yourself.<br/><br/>A number of small variant rules are supplied in the rule book.  The cards are printed in French, English and Dutch.<br/><br/>It is good strategy to build your hand for the end game, so you can, for example, protect a territory with a Revolt, then unprotect it, redeploy Development cards with a strong Cannon, and complete the territory's development with your last few card plays.<br/><br/>Awards<br/><br/>Card Game As d'Or 2001<br/><br/>",

This game is very similar to the standard Mayfair Empire Builder games except that it was a limited edition game for the Huntington Museum of Art as part of their exhibit entitled &quot;Agent of Change: The Railroad in West Virginia&quot;.  Aspects of this game that makes it different than the other Mayfair crayon games is the use of the load sheet, the ability to build coal mines, and the extremely mountainous terrain.  Instead of load cards, the game uses two dice and a load sheet where the player rolls dice and reference the master load sheet to determine the available contracts.  Building coal mines involves building rails through coal mine spaces which causes a load of coal to be available at the nearest coal city.

The game first appeared in White Wolf magazine #42.<br/><br/>The game progresses through three scenarios, each played out on different boards.  The first involves humans escaping off of an ice floe in an attempt to flee the seals.  The seal hunters must save Atlantic City beach goers from the seals in the second scenario, and the third scenario pits the seal hunters against the seals in the oval office.<br/><br/>Three scenario boards are included, as well as chits for people like Al Gore, Tipper, Rambo, Flipper, Lassie, Hank the seal hunter, Revolted mimes, seal pups, etc.  Winning involves collecting victory points which are very much dependent on the scenario.<br/><br/>Game was translated into polish as &quot;Foki Szatana&quot; and published in the &quot;Magia i Miecz&quot; magazine.<br/><br/>",

The compartments each ship has are up to the players, who must strike a balance between offense, defense, repairability, and command.<br/><br/>Players start the game by drawing ship compartment cards from the deck. Each ship compartment can take a certain amount of damage before it is destroyed. When a ship compartment is destroyed, it is discarded. Part of the strategy of Starship Battles lies in how one chooses to manage battle damage.<br/><br/>As the turns progress, players attack one another using their weapons, defend themselves using their shields, change their attacks or defends using command points, and repair damage using engineering capability.<br/><br/>",

Each player receives one of 8 characters and, using dice, chooses weapons with which to attack their opponents, wearing away their life points until they are the last one left standing. Each round of KABOOM! can be played in a matter of minutes, especially if played at a high tempo, and so although players are eliminated, they never have to wait long for a new round to start! Players are encouraged to hold grudges, get into character, mock, cajole, beg and target the player who keeps winning!<br/><br/>While the game is about shooting eachother, it's abstract enough that it's suitable for children, in fact much of the playtesting was carried out on children aged between 7 and 14....But is also fun and suitable for adults, especially adults who are letting their hair down!<br/><br/>",

        "description": "Nannon is a reduction of Backgammon to a super-quick game. Nannon reduces the basic concepts of Backgammon to the smallest feasible combination that still retains the idea of Backgammon.<br/><br/>For instance:<br/><br/>Rather than having &quot;stacks&quot; of men on each position, Nannon allows only one man per spot.<br/>Since you can't &quot;stack&quot; men, contiguous groups of 2 or all 3 men of the same team can't be hit.<br/>Each player has only three men, as opposed to the 15 of Backgammon.<br/>Each player gets one die, rather than getting to use two. (Nannon makes use of the fact that each player has her own die.)<br/>The board only has six positions, instead of 24.<br/><br/>Nannon does, however, still provide a doubling cube, which is rather relevant since the individual games of Nannon are so much shorter than those of Backgammon.<br/><br/>",

The particular gundam series it is based on is Gundam Wing, although they were going to release other expansions to add more series to the game.<br/><br/>To play the game, you need two opposed decks. In this case you need the Wing Gundam starter Set and the Oz Corps Starter Decks.  You play cards depicting giant robots and can equip them with character cards to increase the attack strength.  The  cards are played by playing their cost points.  The cost if discarding a certain number of cards.  Then the robots battle and the loser loses a certain number of cards from his draw pile, when the draw pile is empty, the game is over.<br/><br/>",

The other half is split into three different mini games all built around the same key phrases.  Two involve trying to guess the popular word or phrase by either charades/drawing or talking about the phrase but not using any of the words in the actual question.<br/><br/>The last part involves pure chance where a random event migh help or hinder the current player slightly.  Winning the round in these various activities will earn cards with an individual letter which eventually spells out &quot;D-E-R-I-V-A-T-I-O-N.&quot;<br/><br/>The first player to do this wins the game.<br/><br/>",

However each player only has 3 pieces and the 3 x 3 grid is occupied by only 8 sliding tiles where player pieces can be played. So, although it looks like Tic-Tac-Toe, the game play is completely different.<br/><br/>On your turn you can either play a piece onto an empty tile, move a piece from one tile onto an empty tile, or slide a tile into the empty space. The other player is not allowed to slide a just-moved tile back to where it came from, thus preventing game lock up.<br/><br/>If you get 3 in a row, you win the round and the first player to win 6 rounds wins the game.<br/><br/>",

Cure those in the most dire situations and protect the vulnerable who cannot be immunized. (No one wants zombie babies!) Win the game if the deadly ZOMBIEPOX can no longer spread. Lose if too many people become full-blown zombies.<br/><br/>Not only is the game fun, but through play and the zombie themed narrative, players gain an understanding of group immunity, the need to vaccinate, and systems thinking. Casual and hardcore gamers from 12-65 and have enjoyed ZOMBIEPOX.<br/><br/>Players alternate drawing cards. Each card specifies how the ZOMBIEPOX spreads, and then which resources the player has to combat the outbreak. It's important to protect the vulnerable people on the board, because if they become infected, they immediately succumb to zombification.<br/><br/>",

Once paid, the landing rights to a city may be challenged by paying the owner an additional $20,000,000 and then rolling the dice... high dice wins (ties go to the current owner).

In Super Aggravation there are 20 Red cards and 20 Blue cards. If a marker lands on a red star, draw a Red card. Red cards usually hinder you. Land on a gold/blue star and you have the choice to draw a Blue card. Blues cards are normally helpful.

        "description": "The Napoleonic Wars covers the entire period of conflict from 1796 to 1815.  Each turn represents 4 months.  The map is divided into areas, with terrain in the area (forest, swamp, etc.) and along the area borders (river, mountains, etc.). According to the rules, the pieces represent small corps or oversized divisions.  Some units also represent commanders that can command other units.  Fortresses are also represented by pieces.<br/><br/>The sequence of play is fairly standard for a wargame - <br/>1) Negotiations <br/>2) Rebuilding Cadres<br/>3) Supply Determination<br/>4) Movement and Combat<br/>5) Reinforcements <br/>6) Adjustment of Revenue <br/>7) Move game turn marker<br/><br/>When playing one of the campaigns (i.e., not the full Napoleonic Wars), skip Negotiations, Rebuilding, and Revenue.<br/><br/>The Movement phase has a unique mechanic that requires units with lower (worse) leadership to move before those with better leadership, regardless of which country controls the unit.  Units which don't move when it is their turn may only move later if led by a commander with higher leadership.  A player may use his highest rated leader to preempt the movement of another player's lower rated leader.<br/><br/>This game was sold as a stand alone game with a paper map.  The game could also be played by combining the pieces and mounted maps from the other three games in the series (Napoleon's Italian Campaigns, Napoleon's Russian Campaign, and Napoleon's Peninsula Campaign) and adding the extra rules and pieces from Expansion Module 2.<br/><br/>",

Each player simply rolls the dice, turns the sand timer over and tries to use each die in forming a word or separate words. The letters have values and at the end of one's turn, the player scores for letters in words formed and subtracts the value of unused letters. Two of the dice have a blank face (although the rules mention only one) which are treated as Jokers, which can be used to represent any letter. <br/>A variant described in the rules allows words to be formed crossword style and letters that are part of a word vertically and horizontally count double. <br/>Recommended Ages 8 and up<br/><br/>",

Schmidt. The players relive Pluk's adventures during the game.<br/><br/>In essence it is a roll and move game: each in turn rolls a die and advances his pawn on the track. The winner is the first one to reach the finish. But to be allowed to finish, you must have the game token (Pluk's pigeon friend Dollie). That token is acquired by landing on spaces marked with a pigeon, or by landing next to the owner of the token.<br/>A few spaces on the board allow you to take another player's pawn and put it next to yours.<br/><br/>The board is lavishly illustrated with scenes from the book.<br/><br/>",

        "description": "On the mythical archaeological zone of Palenque, located in the Chiapas State, Mexico, there is a pyramid known as &quot;The Temple of inscriptions&quot;, built by the Mayans to shelter king Pakal's tomb.  The tomb was discovered on June 1952 and it represents one of the most important archaeological discoveries of history.<br/><br/>In this game the players collaborate with the pyramid construction and each player tries to accumulate the biggest treasure in order to win the game. The treasure is formed by the treasure tiles that are obtained during the construction stages, and the jewel cards that can be accumulated till the end of the game.<br/><br/>The rounds are composed by 3 phases.  Each phase concludes when all the players have performed their play for that phase.<br/><br/>PHASE 1: CARDS DRAW<br/>Each player draws 2 cards from the top of the pile.  If a player draws a card of a level that has been already constructed, this card is sent to the discard pile and the player can draw a new card.<br/><br/>PHASE 2: CARDS SWAP<br/>Each player can swap one of their cards with one card at the swap zone; players must leave the cards face up. Cards of already constructed levels cannot be used.<br/><br/>PHASE 3: CONSTRUCTION<br/>Each player decides if he summons to the construction of the pyramid's level, if he chooses not to, then the player must mention that he passes the opportunity to the next player.<br/>If no player summons to the construction, then is the end of the phase 3 and the round concludes.<br/>When a player summons to the construction he must pay 1 point (with his treasure tiles) and place the tile over the gameboard, this gives him the right to be the first to set cards for construction.<br/><br/>CONSTRUCTION RULES<br/>-Pyramid levels must be constructed in ascending order.<br/>-Each pyramid level is completed with 5 construction cards of the corresponding level.<br/>-Jewel cards can be used as wild cards.  Two jewel cards will be considered as one construction  card, so they must be used in pairs for this purpose.<br/>-A player can set a m&aacute;ximum of 3 construction cards.<br/><br/>If a player summons to the construction but the 5 necessary consturction cards (required for the corresponding level) are not completed, then players take back the set cards and the player that has summoned to the construction loses the point that he has paid.  In this case is also the end of phase 3 and the round concludes.<br/><br/>In case that the construction of the corresponding level is completed:<br/>-The corresponding pyramid tile is placed over the gameboard.<br/>-The players that have collaborated in the construction take the corresponding points from the treasure tiles at the gameboard (see the scoring rules).<br/>-Cards used for the construction are sent to the discard pile.<br/>-If any player has cards left of the consturcted level, then he must place them on the discard pile (players have no right to recover these cards).<br/>-If there are cards of the constructed level at the swap zone, they are placed on the discard pile as well and replaced with cards from the pile.<br/><br/>END OF GAME<br/>When the construction of level 9 of the pyramid (temple) is completed, the game ends.<br/>The jewel cards that players have accumulated have a value of 1 point each and are added to the value of thier treasure tiles.  The winner is the player with the most treasure points.<br/><br/>",

All in all it's difficult to know how much cards are worth - but that's what makes for a good bidding game.<br/><br/>Bidding is just one round, so the last bidder has a big advantage. The only way to counter this is by 'Spitting' . You play your spit token and get an extra bid after the last bid. You can only do this once. Once all the spit tokens are played, you're left calculating how much money players have got left . The player purchasing the last card, bids first in the next round. This player enjoys the title of Space Merchant<br/>The winner is the person who has the most money when the game ends!<br/><br/>",

There are one less pillow tokens than players (&agrave; la musical chairs), and each player receives flashlight chips at the outset.  The cards are dealt out to the players, face down.  Every one simultaneously reveals his top card.  If you think one of the cards is the Boogey Man, you scream &quot;Boogey Man!&quot; and try to grab a pillow; the other players must first scream, then try to grab a pillow as well.  The player left without one (if it *is* the Boogey Man) loses a flashlight chip.  You lose a flashlight chip if you caused a false alarm.  (You also lose a flashlight if you forwent screaming, or screamed &quot;Boogey Man!&quot; a second time)<br/>   The player with the most flashlight chips left once another player runs out wins.<br/><br/>Can be played with up to 9 players when two sets are combined.<br/><br/>",

So, we have 36 sides, but only 7 of the sides have pips and the Red Dragon. Each player starts with 20 points worth of chips. (White = 1 point, Red = 5 points, and Blue = 10 points) Play begins with each player putting 5 points in the pot. On your turn, roll the dice and count the pips. The player then takes that many points out of the pot. If there are not enough points in the pot, then the player adds points to the pot until the pot equals the numbers of pips rolled. There are special payment and rewards for rolling all blanks and for when the Red Dragon is rolled. The first time any player does not have enough points to pay the pot, the set has ended. All remaining players total their points and mark them on the score pad (provided with the game) and a new set is started.<br/><br/>",

Then you accumulate points labelled on the pushed out cards when 2-4 but not 1 [when 1 is on the card from your side, your opponent loses that card as well as the last card taken in the second color, either blue or red. When the deck is exhausted, add up your blue and red points accumulated and see who has won.<br/><br/>Contents:<br/><br/>    48 playing cards <br/>    1 rule book <br/>    All packaged in a black velvet bag <br/><br/><br/>Players: 2<br/>Game running time: about 25 minutes<br/>Ages: 11 and up<br/><br/>",

Desperate to stop the Allied blitzkrieg and recapture the vital railroad center at Nancy, Hitler placed General Von Rundstedt in command. To support the counter attack, emergency reinforcements were ordered up to the Western Front that included new and improved models of Panther tanks.<br/><br/>The battle saw the Free French 2nd Armoured Division, led by General Jacques Leclerc, pitted against the counter attacking German forces of the 112th Panzer Brigade. The armored clash at Dompaire confirmed that the French had learned the lessons of war well, and that Allied victory in the West was now at hand.<br/><br/>",

        "description": "Translated from the Italian box:<br/> In ancient times the wise Mother Earth gave birth to the Tribe of Tribes, whose destiny was to dominate the world. This lit the fierce anger of the Big Shadow, that made the world fall into the prison of the eternal alternation between light and darkness, and destroyed the Tribe. But the shaman escaped the vindicative rage and painted on a sacred and inviolable rock, with few primitive signs, the secret to win the dark power of the Big Shadow.<br/>Many and many ages are passed since then. Six glorious Predestined tribes, heirs of the ancient Tribe, decide to face the challenge with the Big Shadow. Their names: Tralon, Orgos, Ab-Diar, Naum, Zark, Groden.<br/>Now, you are the chiefs of those tribes. You have to reach the sacred rock, find the Ancient Sequence, transmit it to your Shaman and defeat the Big Shadow, with great honor. But the path for the sacred rock is long and dangerous. Right outside the village you'll wet yourselves in the Circle of the River of Life, where you can get the gifts of the Language, but you'll have to fight the Salamanders and the Rages, moved by the Big Shadow, to be able to get to the successive Circle, the Land of Chaos. Here you'll be lit with the ancestral frenzy, you'll fight with spears and hatchets the chiefs of the other tribes. Only if you were brave you'll be able to go to the Circle of the Initiation Sea, where you'll learn how to communicate with other tribes. With this you'll finally have completed your Table of the Language and you'll be able to enter the Final Circle: the Knowledge. Here, if you won't get burned by the fire of knowledge, you will be able to read the Ancient Sequence, go back to your village, say the remembered formula and, if it correct, win the game.<br/>But warning: the Big Shadow will try every path to stop you or even win the challenge by covering the whole Circle of Knowledge with its dark presence.<br/><br/>As you have read the game is divided in several parts, each of which has a different objective, that, when reached, will allow players to go to the next part. One of the player is the Big Shadow, and plays against all the others.<br/>Pretty nice but very long game with few standard mechanics and well made components.<br/><br/>",

The board is shaped in such a way that it can be rocked from side to side. A steel marble is placed at the bottom of the path and by rocking the board the marble can be maneuvered up to the top. The leg in the back of the board makes it angle up at the top. Each position has a corresponding score, the higher the score the steeper the angle. Players take turns and score points for each successful trip up the board. If a player loses control and allows the marble to come all the way back down his turn is over. The player with the highest score after a pre-determined number of turns wins.<br/><br/>",

It is 11 inches by 17 inches overall with the Instructions printed on one side, and 7-steps equal to about 2 paragraphs, very concise.<br/>  On the reverse side is the playing AREA, which is a rendering of a &quot;Beachhead&quot;, on the left side of the Board, which also includes the spinner, and 9 &quot;Invasion&quot; Lanes of varying colors and length, leading from the &quot;Beachhead&quot; to the right side of the board.  The length of the Lanes varies from 4, 5, &amp; 6 then jumps up to 11, 12, 13, 14, &amp; 15. The colors of the Lanes are RED 2-4 spaces, Lt. GRAY 1-5 spaces, YELLOW 2-6 &amp; 12 spaces, VIOLET 1-13 spaces, TAN 1-14 spaces, and GREEN 2-11 &amp; 15 spaces.   <br/>  The playing pieces consist of 9 printed cardboard cut-out LANDING craft and 3 WARSHIPS, all of which can be placed within the GAME board for storage.  The SPINNER has numbers and a RETREAT 2 PLACES section and the DEFENDER always spins it.  To begin the game, place all 9 Landing Craft at the high number end of each Invasion Lane.  Then the Defending player spins the Spinner and if a number is spun/picked, then any Landing Craft on that same number is &quot;SUNK&quot;/removed, otherwise the Landing Craft are advanced one space after each spin.  There are 3 &quot;Special&quot; numbers which when spun will &quot;SINK&quot;/remove the Warships and if ALL of them are &quot;SUNK&quot; then the Defender gets to spin TWICE each time.  The OBJECT of the game is for the Defender to sink 5-LC or the Invader to LAND 5-LC.  NO designer/developer credits or DATE on the GAME but a number-#950-50 &amp; Made in U.S.A. are printed below the instructions.<br/><br/>",

        "description": "I keep this game in the cardboard box you can make from Jefferson Airplane's &quot;Long John Silver&quot; album cover. It's appropriate, I promise.<br/><br/>I assume it's published by Rip Off Press, who made the comics. In fact, I suspect that the game was bound into a collection of Fabulous Furry Freak Brothers comics. The rule sheet looks like I cut it out of a magazine. Frankly, I don't remember. You may speculate as to why that is. The game dates from about 1979 or earlier, I think.<br/><br/>The game is a roll-and-move extravaganza. Your goal is to get the most points or the least points (your choice). If you reach 86 points, you are out of the game (there is a Eurogame-esque point track around the perimeter). Eighty-sixed, get it? Never mind.<br/><br/>You must supply a movement token for each player, a counter for each player's score, and three six-sided dice. Roll three dice on your turn, and move into one of the rooms. Once you have entered a room, you roll the three dice again and refer to a chart for each room that gives you points or lets you draw a card.<br/><br/>There is a stack of cards for each room, so that Fat Freddy's room can be different from Freewheelin' Franklin's Room, and both are different from the Living Room. Very important to the theme of the game.<br/><br/>Sample card from Fat Freddy's room: &quot;You unwittingly puncture Fat Freddy's water bed, sending a torrent of water into the apartment below, and causing a COMPLAINT and giving you FOUR points.&quot;<br/><br/>When three complaints have occurred, a RAID is the result and each player rolls the three dice to reach the exit. Those who do not are busted . It's reminiscent of the mechanic from Escape from Colditz.<br/><br/>There are also three special guests to the party, represented by three special cardboard foldup pawns. The Movie Star, The Famous Author, and the Crashing Bore. You can use leftover movement (once you're in a room) to move these pawns. They block other players.<br/><br/>You can also get three points for loitering in the hallway, which is the kind of thing that proves this was play tested.<br/><br/>Actually, reading the rules now I'm not too sure how it ends or how somebody wins. But the artwork is cool and I remember enjoying it whilst simultaneously enjoying something else, if you know what I mean.<br/><br/>",

        "description": "This abstract game consists of five concentric rings divided into sixteen sectors (bars).  Each player has a home sector that is four bars wide.  Ten directional playing pieces start in the center bars of the home sector facing outwards.  Each turn players roll two dice and use each dice roll to move a piece either in its facing direction or along its bar.  When a piece starts a turn outside of it home sector and then is moved within the sector it is removed from the game.  The first player to run out of pieces wins the game.<br/><br/>Additional complexity comes from blocking, capturing (freezing pieces while simultaneously preventing other opposing pieces from entering the bar in which the capture occurs), removing pieces from the board through `ringers' and special moves from rolling doubles.  Variant rules exist for more cutthroat games and games with more than two players.<br/><br/>",

Mice are moved off the playing surface by pulling on their tails and the box top, shaped like a wedge of cheese, is used to catch the mice.  Chips are awarded for each caught mouse. The first player to win 18 chips wins the game.<br/><br/>Three Blind Mice is essentially Carla Cat.<br/><br/>Object of the Game: First Player to get 18 chips is the winner.<br/><br/>To Start the game each player receives nine chips. First player to roll a green spot is the &quot;Catcher&quot;. Other players select a mouse and place mouse on base, holding it by the tail. Catcher rolls color cube by using &quot;Cheese Wedge&quot; as shaker.<br/><br/>Rules of the Game: When a Blue or green spot turns up, the players must pull their mice off the base before the catcher traps them with the &quot;cheese wedge&quot;. If the mouse is caught, the player pays the catcher one chip. If his mouse is not caught, the player is not paid a chip by the catcher. If all the mice escape, the catcher exchanges the &quot;Cheese Wedge&quot; for the mouse of the player on his left and this player now becomes the catcher. When a black or white spot turns up, the players must leave their mice on the base. If a player pulls his mouse off the base when black or white turns up, he pays the catcher one chip. However, if the catcher should touch the base with the &quot;cheese wedge&quot; to the player on his left, and pays one chip to each of the mice still on the base. The player on his left now becomes the catcher. When a player has lost all his chips he is out of the game. As soon as one player has 18 chips he is the winner and the game is over.<br/><br/>",

No where was this trend more evident than in the field of Coastal Warfare. Each night the stillness of the ocean dark would be shattered by the roar of engines as in every theater Patrol Boats began their deadly game of cat and mouse with their enemy counterparts and Merchant Shipping. This set of rules allows the wargamer to recreate the small scale coastal actions which brought back the swash&mdash;buckling era to the seas.<br/><br/>In common with all MOD Games Naval Warfare rules, the percentage dice system is used throughout Fast Attack. The dice &mdash; one red (10's) and one white or black (Units) are always thrown in pairs (e.g. an 8 on the red dice and a 2 on the white or black dice represents a throw of 82%). All figures in the tables are basic percentage chance of hits or detection, after this has been amended by the tactical factors which may apply, the final score is arrived at. A throw of this percentage or less is sufficient.<br/>Figure Scale    1 model    =    1 vessel<br/>Time Scale    1 move    =    10 seconds<br/>Ground Scale    1 cm    =    20 yards<br/><br/>",

The board has a treasure map pictured on it. There is a treasure chest in the center and 4 'betting corners' - one with a picture of a pistol, another with a picture of a cannon, another a trumpet and the last a sword. The chips come in white (worth 1 pt.), black (2 pts.) and gold (3 pts.). The die faces for each die show one each of the 4 betting corner items, a treasure chest and a map (which acts as a joker).<br/><br/>Object: To be the last player with chips.<br/><br/>Distribute the chips evenly among the players. Before each player's turn, all players place 1 chip (value 1) on each betting corner. Player keeps rolling until she wins chips or passes. On your turn: Roll the dice. If all three are treasure chests, take all chips on the treasure chest. (This only applies to 3 treasure chests thrown on the first roll.) If all three are the same betting item, take all chips from the corresponding betting corner and your turn is over. If the roll has different betting items, you can set aside one kind and re-roll the rest. You must put one chip (value 1) on each betting corner that corresponds to the face of a die you will re-roll. (ex: You roll a cannon, a sword and a trumpet. You choose to keep the sword, pay 1 pt to the cannon corner, pay 1 pt to the trumpet corner and re-roll.) As long as you don't win, you can continue to pay 1 point to the appropriate corner(s) for each die re-rolled. Once you have three of the same betting item, take all chips on that item and your turn is over. For each treasure chest rolled, every player (including you) puts 1 point on the treasure chest. You can stop rolling and pass at any time. A player who runs out of chips is out of the game.<br/><br/>",

        "description": "Can you make it as a BACKPACKER?  That's the challenge of a new adventure-filled board game that tells you if you&rsquo;ve got what it takes to travel the world.<br/><br/>Do the Visa Run, find your accommodation, and then hit the bar but keep an eye on your bag! Discover the must-do traveling experiences and the pitfalls to avoid, see the sights and survive the rickety public transport - all whilst racing across six continents with your mates. The first to travel the world in one piece wins the game<br/><br/>Just like the real thing, you have to travel on a tight budget - but don&rsquo;t worry, there are plenty of opportunities to work and even phone home to bag some extra cash from Mum and Dad! You'll realize how quickly your money runs out, learn about the scams, the transport, the toilets... It's as close as you can get to the real thing without the food poisoning.<br/><br/>Designed by Marcus Lane, an experienced traveler, the game offers a backpacking insight that is difficult to grasp from books alone. Marcus says, &ldquo;When I was knocking back a home-made rocket fuel in a remote Asian village one day I realized what a fascinating yet surreal world I was traveling in. I had read books that touched on some of the real issues of backpacking but nothing came close to telling me the full story. I decided to find another way to teach people what they were in for. It's as close to a trial run as there can be. You'll see how challenging yet fun the experience can be as you travel around the world meeting lots of new people and consuming all sorts of strange foods.&rdquo;<br/><br/>Can you make it as a BACKPACKER? is quite simply the fun way to learn how to plan a safe trip.<br/><br/>Great for gap year students, career break gappers or anyone who fancies a trip down memory lane. Contains a gameboard, 6 backpackers, 224 Visa Run cards, 156 Continent cards, a Foreign Embassy, a wedge of doofers (cash), a dice and rules.<br/><br/>No cockroaches included!<br/><br/>",

        "description": "From the Company's Web Site:<br/><br/>Mythmatical Battles is a dueling card game for two players or two teams. It blends mythology and multiplication to create an innovative game which lets kids drill multiplication while engaging in epic mythological battles.  For the first time education is infused into the wildly popular dueling/ collecting card phenomenon. Welcome to a FRESH TWIST ON FLASHCARDS with this fun new MULTIPLICATION GAME!<br/> Each player uses his own Mythmatical Battles Deck, with 55 cards featuring gods, heroes, and monsters from Greek, Celtic, Norse, or Egyptian mythology. Every card has one multiplication equation for its attack strength and one equation for it's defense strength. A single deck contains all the multiplication equations from 1x1 to 9x9.<br/><br/>The players take turns drawing cards from their decks, placing them face-up to the &quot;Field&quot; (known to grown-ups as the table, desk, or floor), and challenging their opponent's cards.  The card with the highest product wins.  But look out --Magic and Weapon cards can change card strengths, and weaker cards can team up to conquer a powerful card.<br/><br/>Each defeated opponent's card goes into the player's &quot;Plunder&quot; pile. The game ends when one player's deck is exhausted. The player with the most cards in her &quot;Plunder&quot; pile when the game ends, wins.<br/><br/>A full deck game takes 45 minutes to play. Or you can play time limit games to fit into a busy class or home schedule. To win a time limit game the person with the most cards in his &quot;Plunder&quot; pile when time's up wins.<br/><br/>Mythmatical Battles is designed for kids in the 3rd to 6th grade. Any kid (and there are millions) who's played with other dueling cards will easily catch on to the rules of Mythmatical Battles, plus learn classic mythology and rock solid math.<br/><br/><br/>",

One must remember thus where which disk is.<br/><br/>Catch me! ... if you can: In this unique game the board is made up of cards with numbers on one side &amp; a rabbit on the other.

        "description": "RARE SPECIES is a 2-4 player memory game endorsed by UK botanist/conservationist David Bellamy.<br/><br/>The game contains a playing board, four conservation park boards, four playing pieces and 24 rare species playing cards.  These cards illustrate breeding pairs of 12 of the world's most endangered and rare species of wildlife.  The females have cards with pink backs and the males have blue backs.<br/><br/>The 12 female cards are placed face down on 12 yellow squares in the middle of the board.  The 12 male cards are placed face up on the 12 green squares that surround the female cards.  The playing pieces are placed on the circular brown track, next to one of the corners of the board.<br/><br/>Players take it in  turns to roll the dice and move their playing piece in a clockwise direction around the board.  Once moved the playing piece will be next to one of the male animal cards.  The player attempts to make a pair by turning over one of the female cards and showing it to the other players:<br/>-  If it is a match then the piece is removed and placed face down in one of the three bamboo cages at the entrance to that player's conservation park.  The male is left in place on the board.  Each cage can only hold one female so therefore a player can only collect a maximum of three females without them forming part of a breeding pair.<br/>-  If it is not a match then the card is returned to its original face down position.<br/><br/>When a conservationist lands next to the male of any species they may make their play as for the opening rounds if they have no females in their bamboo cages.  If, however they have a female or females caged at the entrance to their conservation park, and they think that one of them is the mate of the male that they have just landed next to, they may attempt to turn that female face up:<br/>-  If they are correct they remove the male from the playing board and place it with the female face down in the conservation park (not back in the cage).  This breeding pair takes no further part in the game<br/>-  If they choose the wrong female then it is simply turned face down again on the conservation park board.<br/><br/>Unscrupulous conservationists may also &quot;steal&quot; breeding females from other player's conservation parks.  When a player lands alongside a male and they think that one of the other players has its mate in one of their cages then they can attempt to steal it by turning it over:<br/>-  If they are correct then the piece is &quot;stolen&quot; and moved to one of their own cages.<br/>-  If they are wrong, it is returned face down where it came from, and if the erring player has any females in his own cages then one of them is released back to one of the free yellow squares in the middle of the board.<br/><br/>No more than one conservationist can occupy the same space on the outside track, and spaces that are not next to males (i.e. the male has already been claimed) are not counted for movement purposes.<br/><br/>At the end of the game, when all the females have been paired, the player with the greatest number of breeding pairs in their conservation park is the winner.<br/><br/>",

Then players roll the die and move along their assigned route (from the dispatch card). Many spaces require that a user draw a card and follow the directions. Once a player finishes five trips he wins.<br/><br/>The game is an attempt to present a realistic trucking experience.

The route of the marbles can be manipulated by using the 'Skunker Skulls' - little green skulls which are located at the base of the castle.  The marbles may roll completely through the model (there are instructions, such as &quot;Take Another Turn&quot; where these terminate) or they may activate the spring-loaded platform where the plastic vampire bats have been placed.  The bats are propelled into the air and must be caught in one's Monster Claw.<br/><br/>",

The concept is similar to the repelling forces between two magnets. In the game 'Altar' imaginary repelling forces exist between the different colored playing pieces.<br/><br/>The object of the game is for a player to maneuver the opposing color altar (cube) into the central recess and then to place their own templar (cone) on top of that altar (cube) to win the game.<br/><br/>The three dimensional design of the board incorporates recessed areas. These may only be crossed by the raven (hexagonal shape), which normally requires an obstacle to jump over to complete its move. The other playing pieces may only cross these areas by using an altar piece (cube) as a 'bridge' or 'stepping stone'.<br/><br/>The unique concept which controls and unifies the game enables 'Altar' with relatively few pieces to develop many permutations. Consequently a depth and level comparative to that of 'chess' can evolve with the individual.<br/><br/>",

        "description": "Another case where a black and white design meets a 2 player abstract game.<br/><br/>2 players face each other across a large plastic board that contains 6x6 square plastic tiles. All tiles are divided into a black and white triangular half, with a landing space on each side for the playing piece of that colour. Tiles have a handle stuck in the middle that enables them to be lifted up, twisted round and replaced without the risk of having pieces slip off. Both the black and white player have 6 stones in their respective colours that start on opposite sides of the board. All tiles initially face the same direction, so that no two touching sides have the same colour and hence no &quot;connections&quot; exist on the board at the start of play.<br/><br/>By twisting tiles, players can create &quot;connections&quot; of identically coloured halves, creating a corridor along which pieces of that colour can progress. Each turn players either twist one tile in the aim to improve the available route, or move a stone along one of those routes. Players try to remove all stones in their colour from the other side of the board. The first to do so is the winner. A tile that has just been lifted gets a red marker on it. It prevents that tile from being turned by the player who is next. Additionally, it also prevents 1 or 2 neighbouring tiles from being turned, as long as a connection in that player's colour was created to the neighbouring tile(s) by the newly placed one. An elegant rule that prevents stalemates and adds another tactic to employ.<br/><br/>S&eacute;bastien Sjoholm copyrighted this game in 1989, but it wasn't until 1992 before it appeared with EdiGames, that since has published more of his designs. Connex'Oh won several awards (&quot;As d'Or&quot;, Cannes Festival International des Jeux 1992; &quot;M&eacute;daille d'Argent&quot;, Concours L&eacute;pine, Paris, 1992; &quot;M&eacute;daille d'Or&quot;, Salon international des Inventions de Geneve, Geneve, 1993) and has been re-issued in 1995 as Connexo, again with EdiGames, but this time the board was only 4x4.<br/><br/>",

Every team has 11 players represented by plastic minitures. On your turn you roll a special die that determains how far you may move your players. If you get two numbers you can move two players otherwise you can move just one. The players steal the ball by moving past it. If you end up on the square next to the ball carrier you risk a penalty for roughing. If you complete a pass play you may roll one extra die and move again.<br/><br/>The game is British but seems only to have been available in a Swedish edition. The British name might actually be World Soccer since it is to be found on the side of the lid on the Swedish edition.<br/><br/>It&rsquo;s very similar with the dutch game <a target='_blank' href=\"https://boardgamegeek.com/boardgame/312900/goal\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer noopener\">https://boardgamegeek.com/boardgame/312900/goal</a>.

Three odd little creatures and their frog-friends are playing, and whatever their game is it's good! There's a duck made of paper, a bug trapped in a rock, and a toad spitting sparks from its tongue.<br/><br/>They're all squealing and jumping, leap-frogging and bumping, and racing the pond; oh what fun! Such tumbling and flapping and sparking and quacking; how you'd love to join the confusion. Then they all see you watching and ask you to play, and assure you it's not an intrusion.<br/><br/>Sizzletoad! is the game for two to four players (ages 5 and up) that combines rock-paper-scissors and tic-tac-toe with an exciting leap-frog race around the pond! There's a nice bluffing element as well (especially in the 2-player version).<br/><br/>Players duel with each other in rock-paper-scissors style using their 12-card hands of Fossilticks, Paperducks, and Sizzletoads to decide which player will be able to put cards on the lily pad pond, make a tic-tac-toe, and score the most victory points.<br/><br/>During the race around the pond the excitement builds as the players speed closer and closer to the flower at the finish-line! Care for a game of Sizzletoad! anyone?<br/><br/>This is a great game for parents to play with their kids when they're looking for a bit more variation and strategy than say, &quot;Candy Land&quot; or the like.<br/><br/>Here's a quick &quot;How to Play&quot; summary for the two-player game:<br/><br/>In a two player game, of Sizzletoad! the players shuffle and split the deck (which is filled with an equal number of Sizzletoads, Fossilticks, and Paperducks.)<br/><br/>Each round a single card is compared between the players and the winner of the duel puts either of those two cards onto the lily-pad tic-tac-toe grid of the board.  The other card goes into that player's discard pile.<br/><br/>When one of the players places a matching &quot;3-in-a-row&quot; card on the tic-tac-toe grid, the other player counts the cards in his/her own discard pile, scores one point for each card and moves his/her game piece around the board by that many pips, then hands his/her cards over to the maker of the tic-tac-toe.<br/><br/>The maker of the tic-tac-toe then puts those cards into his/her own discard pile and adds them all up, scoring one point for each card and also moving his/her game piece around the board by that many pips.<br/><br/>All of the cards are then shuffled, re-dealt, and the players have another duel. The players continue dueling and adding cards to the board and their own discard piles and moving their game pieces around the numbered pips on the board.<br/><br/>The winner is the player who makes it all the way around the board onto or past the flowered lily-pad before the other player.<br/><br/>With easy game play, this solid game is a fine addition to any &quot;children's'&quot; game library.<br/><br/>Remember:  Sizzletoad-beats-Paperduck-which-beats-Fossiltick-which-beats-Sizzletoad!<br/><br/>Sizzletoad! by Mindspan Labs (previously WizerGames) is Made in the USA<br/><br/>Mindspan Labs Digital has released a 1 and 2 player app version of Sizzletoad! that is now available in the Apple app store.<br/><br/>",

Two to four players compete at this spin-and-move race to the chimney.<br/><br/>There are two editions to this game. One is a standard long-box game with a traditional foldout game board, featuring flat plastic reindeer on wooden stands. The other edition features a 3-D rooftop game board that sits atop the game box, with holes in the roof to insert the plastic reindeer for movement. Both editions include a wooden nose for Rudolph to help a player in moving through the cloud spaces.<br/><br/>The 3-D version also came with a Santa Claus sack of five jingle bells so that players could mark how many times they had won. I do not recall if the standard edition came with this sack.<br/><br/>",

This is done by laying down a carpet of friendly Checkers for the Kings to jump.<br/><br/>Only one piece may be moved or introduced per turn. Checkers may be introduced onto any empty square. Alternatively, Checkers may move to any adjacent, empty square. A King may only move by jumping (in any direction) over friendly Checkers or Kings, capturing as he goes. Captured Checkers may be reintroduced later, but Kings that are captured do not return to the game.<br/><br/>The mechanics of jumping are the same as in the game Checkers, except that Kings may jump off the far edge of the board, into the 'end zone.' This King is removed from play. If a King has an opportunity to jump, he must jump, continuing until no more jumps are possible. So beware!<br/><br/>Winning: Victory is achieved when a player has jumped two Kings into the end zone.<br/><br/>Royal Carpet is an attempt to create a game of tempo in which friendly pieces have both positive and negative synergies. Crafty players will block jumps and then unblock them later, forcing an enemy King to jump his royal brethren. For those so inclined, this game is fun to play with a backgammon doubling cube, held initially by the Red player.<br/><br/>",

Some ascribe the antagonism to the circumstances of your birth: When the Queen bore identical twins sons many years ago, a careless midwife placed both infants in the same bassinet without identifying the elder, and the rightful heir to the throne has been in doubt ever since. Others believe that your fierce competitiveness is simply a distillation of the belligerence that runs throughout your bloodline. For whatever reason, you have spent your entire life trying to prove your superiority to your brother.<br/><br/>Unfortunately, that life is about to end.<br/><br/>Four days ago Barbarians attacked from the west. Both you and your brother marshaled your individual forces and followed your father to meet the enemy. At first it seemed the battle would be easily won: for each of your soldiers who fell in battle a score of Marauders were dispatched. But by the third day it became apparent that, while your own forces rapidly dwindled, there would be no end to the Barbarian horde. And this morning your losing battle quickly became a rout: The King was slain, you found yourself surrounded, and the forces controlled by you and your brother were reduced to a mere handful a piece.<br/><br/>Now, as the Marauders press in, you know that you will soon be sent to your reward. But you don't fear death. In fact, only one thing weighs on your mind: this is your absolute last chance to outdo your brother. And you are certain he is thinking the same thing.<br/><br/>Object: Each player will attempt to amass more Kills than his opponent before both Princes die in battle.<br/><br/>Reference cards are also provided but not required.<br/><br/>",

        "description": "\t\t\t\t<br/>\t\t\t\t<br/>\t\t\t\t\tIntroductionSymbio is a game where each player's groups of cells, or pieces, attempt to surround each other. It was inspired by the immune system's ability to surround pathogens.<br/><br/>Two players, Black and White, take turns to either place or move one of their pieces adjacent to another of their pieces, on an 8x8 board. In order to make a move, the players' formations of pieces must have an open space adjacent to them. The game ends when one player can no longer make a move.<br/><br/>\t\t\t\t<br/>\t\t\t\t<br/>\t\t\t\t\tDefinitionsIn these rules, &quot;adjacent&quot; always means &quot;orthogonally adjacent&quot;. A body is an adjacent set of pieces of the same colour. A foreign body is an opponent's body. A body has freedom if at least one of its pieces is adjacent to an empty square.<br/><br/>\t\t\t\t<br/>\t\t\t\t<br/>\t\t\t\t\tPlayAt the start of the game, Black pieces are placed on b6, b7, c7, f2, g2 and g3, and White pieces are placed on b3, b2, c2, f7, g7 and g6.<br/><br/>Black plays first, then turns alternate. On their turn, a player must first move one of their bodies and then add a piece to the board adjacent to one of their bodies.<br/><br/>The movement of a body involves taking a piece from the body and moving it to a different square adjacent to the body (including squares adjacent to the piece itself). A body cannot move unless it has freedom.<br/><br/>A body's move may land on a foreign body piece, thus removing it from the board, if that foreign body has no freedom.<br/><br/>A player wins if their opponent cannot add a piece next turn. This will occur if the opponent has either no remaining pieces on the board or no remaining bodies with freedom.<br/><br/>\t\t\t\t<br/>\t\t\t\t<br/>\t\t\t\t\tNotesThe movement rules result in a pseudopod-like movement which may split a body into two smaller bodies (meiosis). Conversely, movement may result in two or more bodies coalescing.<br/><br/>Players should strive to surround foreign bodies and eat them away while giving their own bodies as much freedom as possible. Keeping a foreign body surrounded ties up pieces.<br/><br/>It is thought that cycles cannot occur due to the addition of a piece per turn. Neither player can move on a full board, but the player to place the last piece must by definition win the game.<br/><br/>",

Yellow action cards add excitement to the game by directing players to roll dice, find color chips in a bag or count out loud before discarding a card.<br/><br/>This curious game relies on a coiled plastic tray that may be pressed down to become held in place by a sucker. The sucker holds the tray down for about 1.5 minutes (according to the makers) before suddenly releasing the tray, allowing it to pop up and scatter all cards that happened to be on it.<br/><br/>Players try to play a card that is either a '1' or a number higher than the top card on the tray. The blue cards are numbered from 1 to 10, with lots more 1s than other numbers. The yellow cards are numbered from 1 to 9, but also have actions described on them that must be performed by the next player. The next player has to complete the actions before they are allowed to play their card. The actions could require players to count (for example, from &quot;Sproing 1&quot; to &quot;Sproing 10&quot;), roll a specific combination on two special dice (each die has 3 blank sides and 3 sides showing a coiled spring), or draw a chip of a specified color from an opaque bag.<br/><br/>Anyone unfortunate enough to have the tray pop up during their turn has to keep all scattered cards, which count as points against the player who owns them. The player with the lowest number of points wins.<br/><br/>",

Can you be the first with the solution, hit your button and leave your opponent in a confusion of letters?  But be clever, next time he may turn the tables on you!&quot;<br/><br/>A simple anagram solving game with a twist, the board spins 180 degrees at the press of a button.<br/><br/>The main game component is a large and sturdy plastic board with a rotating central section triggered by either of two chunky red buttons in the corner of each side.  Also included are two plastic trays containing an assortment of letters in two colors, in my edition (blue on white / white on blue and red on white / white on red).  German umlauted versions of A,O and U are also included.<br/><br/>Each player secretly composes a word of up to 10 letters in their home rack on the stationery part of the board, then transposes the word into the upper rack of the yellow turntable.  The turntable is then rotated and each player races to place their other colored letters in the middle rack to try to solve the anagram.  The first player to solve the anagram presses their red button and presents their answer to their opponent.  If correct they win if wrong they lose.  The winning player claims the tiles used by the loser at the end of each round.  Play continues until a player is unable to solve a word with their available letter tiles.<br/><br/>A good educational game designed to expand your child's vocabulary and improve their mental agility with a tiny amount of strategy in word selection.<br/><br/>The only flaw with the game is the overly enthusiastic rubber band powered mechanism, which when activated, scatters both sets of tiles.<br/><br/>",

        "description": "Hoplon 3 is the third edition of a fast play set of ancient and medieval miniatures rules using an amended version of the DBx basing system. This allows players with DBx-based armies to play Hoplon with only minimum changes necessary.   <br/> Although designed for 15mm miniatures, the system also supports 25/28mm play.  Hoplon has been extensively play-tested in clubs and by members of a dedicated Yahoo group, and this testing has led to a number of revisions which have been incorporated into the third edition.<br/><br/>The philosophy behind Hoplon is to provide an easy-to-learn but deep system emphasizing the relative capabilities of different troop types and morale classes, the difficulties of effective command and control and -most of all - the close matching of historical tactics and performance.<br/><br/>In Hoplon, armies are separated into commands, and commands are separated into units. Troops are activated and controlled by means of command points. While single elements can function individually, they do so at a cost when detached from their parent formations, losing their unit's stamina, cohesion bonus, and ability to maneuver in groups. This in turn forces players to deal with the tactical control problems inherent in commanding large bodies of ancient and medieval troops. Sequence of play is by interleaved-Command (both players moving on the same round by order of initiative of their commands) rather than alternating on every round, which makes tactical decision-making all the more interesting.<br/><br/>While it uses a points system and army lists loosely based on the DBM model, Hoplon has taken a fresh approach to game-play which provides a realistic and historically satisfying simulation of ancient and medieval warfare. As a result, most historical battles require little or no tweaking to re-fight making this set a real tool for simulating actual battles.<br/><br/>",

        "description": "A steel ball is set moving down a ramp towards the base, on which a tower of barrels must be built. Each barrel has a protruding shape on top and a different indented shape on the bottom, to allow some combinations of barrels to interlock. Players must find the correct barrels as quickly as possible and stack as many as they can before the ball arrives. When they have completed as much of the tower as they are able, they shut a gate to stop the ball from reaching the barrels. If they are too slow, the whole tower will fall over when hit by the ball. Players take it in turns to see how high a tower they can build.<br/><br/>Players may use one hand only to stack the barrels. Points are awarded for barrels left standing after shutting the gate and a game comprises three rounds.<br/><br/>The game is called 'Up Against Time!' on the box and 'Up!

        "description": "Transfer is a simple abstract 2-player game that is played on a 4x4 grid. Each player starts with 4 egg-cups, in one of two colors, on the base row of the grid, with a ball on the two corner ones. The aim is to be the first player to move these cups to the baseline of the opponent and get the 2 balls again onto the 2 egg-cups on the edges. If the starting player does this first, then the opponent has the chance to get a draw if they manage to do the same thing in the turn immediately afterwards.<br/><br/>Each turn a player picks one of two moves. A player can either move one cup with a ball to a free space that touches it, horizontally, vertically, or diagonally. Or a player can move the ball from one of their pieces to another one of their pieces that touches it in those same directions. When a blockade occurs, by 2 rows that block each other on the center rows, the active player may jump with a piece that contains a ball over an opponent's piece. When one player still has a piece on the start line, and the opponent has filled all other end-spaces, that piece needs to vacate its space right away. If this is impossible (when it doesn't contain a ball), then that player loses immediately.<br/><br/>This appears to be Dieter Hartmann's only published game.<br/><br/>PUBLICATION HISTORY:<br/><br/>     1978 Transfer Edition Perlhuhn (Göttinger Spiele) - out of print<br/><br/><br/>Like all typical Edition Perlhuhn releases, this game comes in a tube, with chunky wooden pieces (black and red) and a board that is printed on a fake leather vinyl.<br/><br/>ADDITIONAL INFO:<br/><br/>     language skill needed: language neutral.<br/>     English translation: none.

The players take turn drawing from the bag, but be careful, if the wolf's head appears, you have to put an item of clothing on him! This fun game is suitable for players of 3 years and over because there are three versions of the game: all together, one against another or alone... But always against the Wolf.<br/><br/>The game comes with a board representing a forest, onto which six different kinds of items are spread: mushrooms, strawberries, snails, blackberries, flowers and butterflies. In addition, each player receives one leaf-shaped individual board that is uniformly green on one side (for using in cooperative mode), and covered with the shapes of five of the six items on the other side (used in competitive and individual modes). The wolf is drawn on a magnetic board and its five items of clothing (shoes, trousers, jacket, hat and umbrella) are magnetic too. In the bag, eight cardboard discs represent each of the six items that can be picked from the forest, plus the head of the wolf and a clover leaf.<br/><br/>The players draw in turn one disc from the bag. If the wolf's head is drawn, they put an item of clothing onto the wolf. If it is the clover leaf, they can take one item of clothing off the wolf or choose one item of their choice from the forest (competitive and individual mode) or two items from the forest (cooperative mode). Otherwise, they take the item represented on the disc from the forest. The disc is then put back in the bag and passed to the next player.<br/><br/>In competitive mode, the winner is the first player who manages to pick up all the items represented on his board. In cooperative mode, the players win if they manage to empty the forest before the wolf is fully clothed. In individual mode, the player wins if he manages to pick up all the items represented on his board. The game is lost in any mode if the wolf gets all its clothes on.<br/><br/>",

The goal of the game is to have each of your thims on the last four squares of the board.  The player can use the blue arrows to advance up the board if he lands on one and if he lands on a square with a red arrow must slide to the bottom of the arrow.  There are some special squares that force the player to roll a six to move past that square and some that allow the player to roll the dice again.  The most interesting square on the board is the STYMIE square.  If a person gets his thim to land on the STYMIE square no other player may move their thims past him until he moves his thim.  This makes for a burst for the finish ending in many games.  Players may move any of their thims on their turn including ones that may be buried in a stack of other thims as long as they take all thims resting on top of theirs.  This rule does not apply on the top row where only the top thim may move.<br/><br/>This is a fairly simple game and probably appeals mostly to children.  However there are usually four options for the player on every turn and the race for the finish is usually close.<br/><br/>",

The 8 pieces are called &quot;totems&quot;: statues consisting of four stacked cubes, each separately pivotable, and a sculptured head on top of them. On the four cubes you find the same symbols and colours as on the field.<br/>Each totem can move on the field with the same sign AND colour like the corresponding cube of his pole (the side facing the player!) as follows: If you want to move one space, your lowest cube must correspond to the space one step away, etc., the topmost to the space four steps away. At every turn each player may either move one of his totems as many spaces as the correct cube corresponds to the target field (he can change directions during his move as often as he wishes) or turn one of the cubes of one of his totems and thus prepare for future moves. There is no capturing.<br/>The aim of the game is to move first one of your totems from your starting row to the marked &quot;totem space&quot; on the opposite side (2-player version) or on one of three totem spaces on the sides not being your starting row. In the 2-player game, each player owns 4 Totems, in the 4-player variant 2 of them.<br/>To foresee their opponents` next moves, players have to remember the possibilities of the other totems - more easily done, because before the first move, each player puts the cubes of the opposing Totem into the positions he wants to.<br/>There is a bluff element, too, as only the player moving knows, whether his move is correct or not. If another player doubts the correctness, he may call &quot;Totem!&quot; and the move is checked. If it was not correct, the challenging player can put all the totems of the disproved player on adjacent spaces of his choice. If the move was correct, the same happens the other way round.<br/><br/>The game is part of the Series: Cirkle, consisting of corresponding games, all with the same symbols and colours.<br/><br/>",

        "description": "A classroom game based on the Battle of Britain. Combat is resolved by drawing cards from a standard card deck. Other components required for play are German and British Flight Rosters, a Battle Board, the Reinforcements schedule, and the Combat Resolution Tables.<br/><br/>&ldquo;Divide the class into two groups - the RAF (Britain) and Luftwaffe (Germany). Each team must have an air marshal. Air marshals will be in charge of allocating resources and aircraft to targets, and filling in the flight roster. The remaining students will be pilots (German fighter or bomber pilots, British fighter pilots). If necessary, divide the students in small groups and call them &lsquo;wings.&rsquo; The German players start with 10 bombers and 10 fighters. The British players start with 6 fighters. This information should be put on the flight rosters.&rdquo;<br/><br/>&ldquo;The Battle Board should be drawn on the chalkboard, or someplace else where all the students can see it. On the Battle Board write the three targets: air bases, radar, and London. This is where each turn you will write down the number and type of planes sent by each side to attack or defend each target.&rdquo;<br/><br/>&ldquo;Objective: Germany must either destroy London OR both the air bases AND radar. The British win by destroying 15 German planes or preventing the Germans from winning. The battle will last 5 turns or until one side wins a victory.&rdquo;<br/><br/>",

        "description": "&ldquo;The Sengoku or &lsquo;Warring States&rsquo; period of Japanese history lasted from 1467 - 1615 AD. During this time warlords and their samurai armies waged civil war. In 1590 Toyotomi Hideyoshi succeeded in uniting Japan under his rule. After his death there was a power struggle between a coalition of Eastern clans led by Tokugawa Ieyasu and a Western coalition led by Ishida Mitsunari.&quot;<br/><br/>&quot;Their final showdown occured near the town of Sekigahara in 1600 AD. The armies were evenly matched. Mitsunari deployed his army to block the vital Nakasendo road, with Kobayakawa Hideaki's large clan in position to threaten the Eastern army's left flank. However Hideaki had secretly promised Ieyasu that he would switch sides once the battle started. The Eastern army launched a determined attack and made good progress. Slowly the Western army drove them back and began to counterattack. Mitsunari and Ieyasu both tried to convince Hideaki to intervene on their side. Finally he made his decision and charged down the hill right into the flank of the Western army. His betrayal was decisive, and the Western army was routed.&rdquo;<br/> A miniatures wargame intended for classroom use with two teams of students (grades 6-8). The game is designed to be played on a 7.5x5 foot table using 1/72 scale plastic miniatures mounted two per stand.

        "description": "&ldquo;The Thirty Years War was a complicated period of military conflict in Europe. The war was fought primarily in Germany as the various German Principalities allied themselves with the Holy Roman Empire or their opponents, France, Sweden, and Denmark. A religious conflict between Protestant and Catholic forces was an important factor early in the war, but later it developed into a struggle for power among the great nations of Europe.&quot;<br/><br/>&quot;During the war armies fought in massive, slow moving formations called Tercios. The Tercio consisted of a large oblong formation of pike men with smaller formations of musketeers at the corners. During battle the Tercios would trudge together and battle it out &lsquo;at push of pike&rsquo; until one side broke.&quot;<br/><br/>&quot;King Gustav of Sweden changed everything, however, by introducing revolutionary tactics that relied on smaller formations and emphasized movement and firepower instead of brute strength. The genius of his innovations was demonstrated in 1631 at the battle of Breitenfeld when his Swedish army handily defeated Tilly's larger old style Imperial army.&rdquo;<br/><br/>A miniatures wargame intended for classroom use with two teams of students (grades 6-8).

        "description": "A mancala game from Keren. From <a target='_blank' href=\"http://mancala.wikia.com/wiki/Qelat_(Keren\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer noopener\">http://mancala.wikia.com/wiki/Qelat_(Keren</a>)<br/><br/>&quot;Mancala variants are often played in the Keren-Agordat area of western Eritrea. Most players are herdsman taking their cattle to water, newly married couples and their friends, and housewives in their homes.<br/><br/>Qelat is usually played in holes in the ground, but wooden boards are also known. The following game was observed by Richard Pankhurst in 1971 who called it Qelat II (Game 5). It might be related to Um el Banat (&quot;game of women&quot;), a mancala game to be found in northern Sudan.<br/><br/>Rules:<br/><br/>Qelat is played on a two-row board with six playing holes per row called b&eacute;t in Bil&eacute;n (literally &quot;house&quot;) and two larger holes at the end of the board to store captured balls. Initially there are four balls in each b&eacute;t. The balls are called til in Bil&eacute;n, if they are dry goat droppings or shesher, if they are small stones.<br/><br/>The balls are always sown one by one in an anti-clockwise direction.<br/><br/>If the last ball falls into a non-empty hole, its contents including the last dropped ball are picked up and continued to be distributed into the following holes.<br/><br/>The move ends when the last seed falls into an empty hole.<br/><br/>The players try to capture enemy holes by increasing their contents to four with the last sown ball in any hand. Captured holes are known as ekwarna, literally &quot;a child is born to me&quot;.<br/><br/>A move may not start from an ekwarna with the result that balls would tend to accumulate in such holes. A player dropping the last ball in any hand into one of his own ekwarna might say lagadi yekura, literally &quot;grow up my children!&quot;.<br/><br/>When the last ball falls into an ekwarna captured by his opponent he would &quot;eat&quot; (qunna in Bil&eacute;n) one of the counters in that hole, and put it, together with the ball effecting this capture, aside as his takings.<br/><br/>A player's ownership of an ekwarna continues even if it becomes empty. Thus balls subsequently entering such a hole, belong to the player who had captured it, while his opponent on dropping the last counter of any lap there would put this counter aside as his takings.<br/><br/>It is not permitted to pass as long as a player has a legal move.<br/><br/>The round comes to an end when all the balls are captured either by being put aside or accumulated in ekwarna. The players then count out their total earnings by placing them back in their holes, four counters per hole. Pankhurst reported:<br/><br/><br/>        A player who had captured more than his original number of counters would gain one hole from his enemy for every four balls he captured. Should a player have won three extra counters his opponent, who had an extra counter, was obliged to cede to the player with tree who thus acquired an additional hole. If, on the other hand, the two players were each left at the end oft the round with two extra balls they would draw lots to decide to whom they should belong and who in consequence should gain the hole at issue. <br/><br/><br/>Eventually, the player who gains a monopoly of all the balls and hence of all twelve holes is declared winner.<br/><br/>",

        "description": "Rollo Gebhard is a German skipper who sailed round the world in several boats (all named Solveig), with his wife as well as single-handed. He founded the &quot;Gesellschaft zur Rettung der Delfine&quot; (association for saving the dolphins) in 1991, which has nothing to do with the game except that it mentioned on the box.<br/>The game comes with a large (52x80 cm) board, 4 dobbers (representing boats), 2 dice, 120 question and incident cards, 132 fuel cards and a wad of game money.<br/>Players normally start in L&uuml;beck and try to travel round the world, using square spaces that sometimes carry special numbers or symbols. They must make port in every harbour along the route. They have the option to travel under engines, but must spend fuel cards when doing so. They must also manage their money, as harbour fees must be paid (by penalty of losing the game instantly). To move, players roll two dice and may decide which to use first for one straight lap of movement.<br/>Specially marked spaces are incident fields (players must draw an incident card, which may turn out to be a question that must be answered- correct answers are rewarded by an extra move) and log fields where special events take place (like extra cost, restricted movement etc.). Fields with numbers are &quot;storm&quot; areas; on those spaces, the number printed on the board must be subtracted from the die roll or must be paid by extra fuel cards.<br/>The rulebook briefly mentions a couple of possible variants, like choosing different routes, doing away with the engines or using only one die.<br/><br/>",

        "description": "The Dogfight Battles of July and August 1942<br/> Rommel's success was inspiring, even to his sworn enemies. Time after time, his panzers swept across the desert like hot sirocco winds in their unrelenting blitzkrieg fashion. The British were nearing their end, so it seemed. Whatever defenses they created did little to halt Rommel. The Germans were also nearing their end logistically speaking as El Alamein was far, far away from their main supply depots. Rommel's own panzers were wearing out from all of the fast advances that had totally kept the British off balance.<br/>The first of the grueling dogfight battles occurred from July 1-4. Hitler was pressing Rommel to go for the kill and reach the Nile. Rommel, himself, felt certain the British were at their end after the unraveling of their defenses in June and their chaotic retreat. But his DAK divisions had suffered and most were really just regimental size. Panzer divisions had a mere 30 tanks. Still, he went forth confident. In this battle, fuel was not an issue, but Rommel attacked without much intelligence as to where the enemy really was. For the British, it was their last stand. They could not afford another Gazala or Tobruk because it would mean Egypt was German.<br/>The second dogfight battle in the same area began August 30th. Rommel would once again try his sweep around the end tactic and block all retreat routes. The battle is also known as Alam Halfa. Rommel had replenished his panzer divisions this time but fuel was a keen issue, as his plan called for them to advance deep into the rear of the British and cut them off. The problem was that his panzers would then have little fuel. By now, Rommel was more hesitant in this offensive and secured guarantees from Hitler that more fuel would arrive. Hitler promised. Reluctant, the order was again given in what was his last attempt to reach the Nile. The British were well prepared this time around and more or less knew of the plan. Their minefields were widened, units were instructed to let the German's come to them, their bombers readied. Dogfight 2 ended on Sept. 3, and the British lost a precious chance to encircle the DAK.<br/><br/>There are two games distinct from one another. Each uses different rules, counters and maps. They are at different scales with dogfight 2 being more tactical and dogfight 1, operational.<br/>Each day turn in dogfight 1 is 8 hrs, 1 mile hexes. In dogfight 2, it is 4 hrs, and most units are company size. AFVs have armor ratings using a new system. Each game has 11x17&quot; map and has 280 counters.<br/><br/>",

Averett&quot;.<br/><br/><br/>No country ever lost a war by being too strong&quot; <br/>Field-Marshall Viscount Montgomery of Alamein<br/><br/><br/><br/>CONQUEST OF THE WORLD represents a significant departure from traditional game design. The components have been designed to provide you with a very realistic model of the real world to both electronically and graphically simulate strategic and tactical confrontation between world powers. <br/>Electronic land, sea and air forces can be deployed against each other in any combination and are totally dependent on supplies which are represented by energy units.The game board is a true-to-life model of the relationships between countries of the real world in the early 1980's.<br/><br/>Forty-three countries have been divided into eleven &quot;politectonic&quot; or geo-political zones. Each country has been weighted with a power base figure that reflects its capability to persuade other nations to conform to its wishes - by diplomatic coercion or by direct military force.<br/><br/>These figures are based on the formula created by Ray S. Cline, formerly Deputy Director of Intelligence for the C.I.A.<br/><br/>Pp = (C+E+M)x(S+W)<br/><br/>PERCEIVED POWER = (Critical Mass (Population + Territory) + Economic Capability + Military Capability) x (Strategic Purpose + National Will).<br/><br/>Future shifts in world power and change in governments will - of course - make changes in these numeric weightings appropriate. Players can feel free to sustain realism by changing the numbers assigned to each country as life goes on.<br/><br/>If you play other war games such as those published by Avalon Hill and SPI, you will find that the computer cartridge interfaces very effectively with them. The onscreen combats will generate much more excitement and realism than the usual dice provided to resolve conflicts. Onscreen energy units can be programmed into the computer to reflect the relative strength between different forces. The differential between the onscreen energy units at the end of each battle can also be applied to the combat results tables that come with these games.<br/><br/>Conquest of the World is the first game of its kind, so be ready for many unusual features. Take the rules one step at a time and you will find it to be a fascinating game of endless challenge - which, once learned, is not at all difficult to explain to others.<br/><br/><br/>THE OBJECTIVE OF THE GAME is to lead your Homeland to world domination through negotiations, conquests and alliances. Each successful conquest and alliance you make will strengthen your country's power base. The country with the strongest power base at the end of the game is the winner.<br/><br/>",

        "description": "During the summer of 1918, Turkey created its &ldquo;Army of Islam&rdquo; con-sisting of the 5th, 15th Divisions, later the 10th also joined. Having been defeated in Palestine, the Turks looked for easier prey and this was the Trancaucasus-Caspian area of Azerbaijan. This newly formed country asked Turkey for protection from the Bolsheviks, which also wanted the area. The Reds were defeated in late June but they remained in control of Baku until mid July. Turkey, like the British, saw Baku&rsquo;s worth in its oil and ordered its army to march hundreds of miles to seize it despite Germany&rsquo;s strong protests (who wanted it also through political means). By the end of July, the Turks were fast approaching Baku. This prompted the British to send Dunsterforce, 1000 men, to Baku, all arrived in the nick of time. The situation for the British was dire from the start. In manpower, the odds were 10 to 1 in favor of the Turks!<br/><br/>",

However by 1943 the German army was on the brink of disaster . . . Hitler decided to gamble on a massive armored assault designed to force the Soviets out of the war before the Allies could open a new front in Western or Southern Europe . . . The battle of Prokhorovka, near the end of the Kursk campaign, was the largest tank battle in history.<br/><br/>The game's order of battle is simplified, eliminating infantry and anti-tank guns. The Germans have Tiger, Panzer IV, and Panzer III tanks.

However the bridge is not stable and will collapse if there is ever too much weight on it.<br/><br/>Each player is secretly assigned one of six colours at the start of the game. The players throw the die in turn and make a number of moves with any pawns equal to the value rolled. Each space on the bridge has a weight score and if the sum of the pawns' weight is greater than the stability score of the bridge, it collapses. Pawns at the start and in the middle of the bridge fall into the river and swim back to the start, pawns near the end land on rocks and are eliminated.<br/><br/>If a player wishes to move his pawn to the goal and win, he must declare his intention to do so before rolling.

Players begin with 5 regular playing cards in their hand, drawing one card and playing one card of their choice per turn.  Each card allows specific movement on the board.

The score is deadlocked and the crowd is screaming. The ball is passed out to the back line: the outcome hinges on what you do next!<br/><br/>Five Men Standing is for both lovers of the glorious game, and those who have never held a Rugby ball in their hands. Fast paced, competitive, and with no sissy turn taking, this is a game of frantic action and fun! <br/> Each player controls a set of 5 Rugby players, drawn from 2 of the teams competing in the 2011 Tournament. How you manipulate, position, and toss these players will determine the ultimate victor.<br/><br/>--- How To Play ---<br/> Each player takes a team of five Rugby player figures in their hand, then yells:<br/><br/>Touch! Players cup their figures in both hands, then reach out and bump hands with their opponent&rsquo;s<br/>Pause! Players withdraw hands from their opponent&rsquo;s<br/>Engage! Players release their figures onto the playing surface<br/><br/>The figures will bounce around and land in one of four stances, from best to worst: Standing, On Side, On Back, Face Down in the mud.<br/><br/>Your aim is to yell Stop! when you think you have a combination that will beat your opponent.<br/><br/>If your first throw wasn&rsquo;t great, don&rsquo;t just sit there moping. This isn&rsquo;t your grandma&rsquo;s tiddly winks, this is Five Men Standing Rugby! Speed and skill count, so grab the figures you want to throw again and see if you can improve your combo. Just remember, you can&rsquo;t pick up figures that are Face-Down in the mud. Those blokes are out of play.<br/><br/>And be fast, because your opponent will be doing the same and might yell Stop! first...<br/><br/>Combos are based on Poker, with a couple of twists, and are ranked on the provided Score Board.<br/><br/>If you win a round, you take a Rugby ball token. When they're gone, the player with the most tokens wins.<br/><br/>There's also Advanced Scoring Rules for Legends, solitaire rules, and you can add more players by buying more Country Team Packs.<br/><br/>",

That&rsquo;s right Literati Challenge is the new, laugh out loud party game of bluffing and creative chutzpa. Players get five words on cards. Each player must write a story using all the words in 90 seconds. The challenge? You may not know the meaning of the words, but to score points you need to make the other players believe you do. Players are scored during each turn. First player to reach 300 points wins. Literati Challenge is sure to get your creative mojo rising and your family and friends howling!&quot;<br/><br/>This differs from Baffle Gab in that it is targeted for adults (Age 15+) where Baffle Gab is a Family game (Age 7+). The words used would be different and lend to a different experience. The most significant difference between these games is that in Literati Challenge, the cards provide word definitions on the back of the cards, while the cards in Baffle Gab do not.<br/><br/>",

Dept. 13 is a secret government agency dedicated to fighting supernatural forces. The game includes super spies (who are identified only by one letter initials), Nazi zombies, ghouls, mad scientists, and themes of occult horror. As with the other games in the S&amp;G system, the battles are very quick and can be fought one-on-one or with players each controlling large groups. Each character has several unique stats, including their fighting ability, and the cost to hire them as a mercenary into your fighting force.<br/><br/>Each turn, players activate a character which can take up to two actions, including fight, move, rest, climb, or stand/go prone. Characters can attack enemies that are one square away for melee attack or may use ranged attack for enemies further away. Fighting is based on power of the weapon, power of the character's attack strength, and power of the enemies defense strike. The hit points are calculated via 2D6 - the power of the attack. For example, if an attack had a total strength of 6 and a 10 was rolled, the attack would have a power of 4. Victory is achieved by having a character remain on a certain part of the board for three complete uninterrupted turns.<br/><br/>",

        "description": "Every summer, crowds gather in the New Mexico desert for a show like no other. Daring pilots compete in exhibitions of aerobatic skill and bravery. Dogfights, air races, and bombing runs are guaranteed to test the mettle of even the most seasoned veteran. Have you got what it takes?<br/><br/>Air Show is a game and a game system. Take the controls of a stunt plane and put your piloting to the test in a variety of aerial events. Manage your altitude and airspeed, perform cool stunts to turn the tables on your opponents, think fast, shoot straight, fly true, and maybe you'll take home the trophy this year.<br/><br/>This game uses a simultaneous action selection mechanic to program a flight plan three maneuvers in advance. Players have thirty seconds to &quot;lock in&quot; their maneuvers and stake out a position in turn order. When everyone is ready, maneuvers execute in turn order. Planes may dive or climb, turn right or left, accelerate or brake, or perform a stunt at the expense of altitude or airspeed. The goal differs with each event, but strategies emerge from anticipating what other players are doing and planning around that. Unlike other games of this type, such as RoboRally or Wings of War, there are no cards to play. All maneuvers are available to all players at all times, to the limits of what their current altitude and airspeed allow.<br/><br/>",

        "description": "&quot;Auf Spurensuche am Limes&quot; is a board game with an accompanying book with 48 pages of background information.<br/><br/>The game board shows a excavation site with zones of different depth. At the start of the game, findings and discoveries (tiles connected to one colour) are distributed on the site, face up. In a next step, all findings are covered with the dust of time - terrain tiles on top of them, thus creating multiple layers of tiles. Only after this, colours are assigned to the players - hopefully thy remember some of &quot;their&quot; findings.<br/><br/>Each player plays a team of archaeologists trying to excavate in particular those findings which match his own research assignment (colour). In trying to achieve that, however, fragments of roman documents might be discovered, earning the player additional points.<br/><br/>At a player's turn, he performs each of 4 actions:<br/>- Move his expedition manager 1 - 3 spaces around the border of the site (to more promising sectors). His position determines the spaces of the site which can be reached by archeologists (neutral colour).<br/>- Now the player has 5 movement points to move one or more neutral archeologists, either to the sector determined by his own expedition manager or to some bad position for the opponents.<br/>- The 3rd action the site is explored. Two terrain tiles with archeologists on them are lifted and the things nderneath are now visible. They are (mostly) not directly available.<br/>- Finally, the player can perform an excavation. To get the several findings visible, you need to place one or more archeologists around the space, depending on the depth of the zone.<br/><br/>Findings of your own colour are directly put into the museum, more worthy findings are replacing ones with lesser value.<br/>Findings of an opponent`s colour are not that easily excavated. You need allocated points or some dice luck to get them.<br/><br/>Since mostly a finding is not discovered and excavated in the same turn, players have to be careful not to discover findings, which can be easily &quot;grabbed&quot; by their opponents.<br/><br/>The game ends when one player manages to excavate all of his assigned findings (winner of the game). If nobody manages to do so, the  game ends, when a player reaches the end of the &quot;expedition track&quot;, where successful excavations and discoveries are registered, and the player with the most allocated points wins the game.<br/><br/>The advanced game offers fences to make it harder for opponents to excavates findings discovered by other players.<br/><br/>",

Everyone gets a working capital to do this. One player controls the Central Bank. Each player buys a site belonging to an amusement park and tries to fill it up with attractions. As in reality this will not all go smoothly. Financial difficulties will arise because attraction prices will fluctuate and because players are forced to conclude transactions with the Central Bank and the other players. The visitors (players which end up at attractions during play) will pay entrance fees to the owner of the park, which will have to manage on it. Moreover, the &quot;Plus-Pech&quot;-cards (Luck-Bad Luck) will provide ups and downs. The game ends when all players except one are bankrupt. Alternative game ends are at a pre-determined time or property limit.<br/><br/>",

        "description": "'Face 2 Face' is a memory style game that consists of 32 tiles. 16 of those tiles show different animal faces. The other 16 tiles have a big hole in the middle and only show the outlines of the same animal faces.<br/><br/>Each set of tiles is laid face down in its own 4x4 grid. The players then take turns flipping over a single tile in each grid and then check whether they match or not. To do so, they put the tile with the hole on top of the tile without the hole. The rest is classic memory: if a matching pair is found, the player gets to keep the set and gets another turn. If a funny face appears, the tiles are put back in the grids and the next player gets a turn. The player having collected the most pairs wins the game.<br/><br/>In addition to this, the game offers three other variants for different age groups:<br/>'Funny Faces' (ages 2+) is a single player puzzle activity where a random tile of each set is chosen and paired up to make fun of the result.<br/>'First face' (ages 5+) is a reaction game where the tiles with a hole are laid face up in a 4x4 grid and the tiles without a hole are stacked face down. The top tile of the stack is then turned over and players try to be the first to put their finger in the hole of the matching tile.<br/>'Peek a boo' (ages 6+) is a multiple level memory game in which all tiles are shuffled together and randomly stacked face up in 4 different piles. The players then take turns moving the top tile of one stack to the top of a different stack. If the top tiles on two stacks show a matching pair, the player takes them and the next player takes his turn.<br/><br/>",

        "description": "When scientists found a granite slab at the Malibu Archeological Dig with a single ancient alphabet character on it, they were puzzled. Soon they uncovered another slab and another and another. Some slabs were identical. Most slabs contained several characters. Fifty-four slabs were found in all. Experts were stumped.<br/><br/>Word of this curiosity reached the recreational laboratories at Victory Point Games. Professionals here immediately recognized what the archeologists had found: a word game. Perhaps they had found the first crossword game ever devised. You now hold what we believe is the word game cave people used to play, which we've come to call Vie. The original rules to this game have been lost to antiquity. This version should be more manageable than the original version of the game. (After all, granite is so hard to shuffle.)<br/><br/>At the start of the game, nine starting cards &mdash; each with a single letter on them &mdash; are laid out in a 3x3 grid. Each turn, you place a new card over an existing card to try to create new words, scoring them based upon the number of letters on the cards that you use to make those words. (Each square card in the draw deck has letters or letter combinations on 1-4 sides. On your turn, you can either choose one of the face-up cards on display or draw the top card of the deck.) You can score multiple words with the same card play &mdash; and you score for all letters on a card used in your word, not only the particular letter or letters used &mdash; so landing the best-scoring opportunities requires some strategic planning. Play continues for a number of rounds that decreases with more players.<br/><br/>",

Unfortunately, the neighbors are often prepared with weapons (including shotguns, holy water, machetes, stakes, and more). The game's art is humorous, parodying pop-horror icons from TV and movies (e.g. Buffy, Star Trek, Dawn of the Dead, etc).<br/><br/>Game-play: On your turn, you can attack any other player with a monster card. If the defending player has a matching weapon, they equip that weapon by placing it under a living family member card and remain safe. For instance, if you attacked with &quot;hell mutt&quot; (a demon) and they equip &quot;holy water&quot; (an anti-demon weapon), they're safe.  Otherwise, the defender must choose one of their family members to perish. Flip that card over, revealing a gravestone.<br/><br/>If you can't or don't attack, you may play an action card or discard to refresh your hand. At the end of your turn, you refill your hand to 4 cards.<br/><br/>There are two ways to win: 1) kill all your neighbors; 2) equip your family with all 4 kinds (suits) of weapon.<br/><br/>",

And it worked &ndash; until you decided to rest in an abandoned barn without knowing it was the meeting place for all the nearby villains in their ultimate quest. The battle between you and them was short but fierce. It was a battle with no survivors...only legends.<br/><br/>In Roundhouse Kick, each player is an escaped prisoner who must fight several monsters in an abandoned barn. In each round all players roll the dice and try to kill as many monsters as they can because the monsters are worth points. After the players attack, though, the monsters fight back. The game ends once all the monsters or all the players are dead.<br/><br/>",

Players take turns to roll and move on spaces around the circular board, receiving a wine-related trivia question each turn. A successfully answered question is rewarded with one of the four resources (barrel, grape, bottle, and cork). Some spaces allow for special actions along with the trivia question (including swapping, trading, or stealing resources). A player who has collected all four resources may enter the center of the board, &quot;production,&quot; no longer rolling to move but instead progressing through four final stages (crushing, fermenting, aging, and bottling). The first player to complete the production stages is the winner.<br/><br/>",

The bars are either straight or slanted left or right.<br/><br/>Each player has a set of dice (one in each color) and a dice cup. Players reveal one card, then simultaneously roll their dice, trying to roll results that would fit the current mobile card. (If all three bars are straight, that would be four of the same number; if the two lower bars are straight, but the top one is slanted to the right, then the two dice hanging from the right side must be higher than the two on the left.)<br/><br/>The first player to roll a &quot;solution&quot; that fits the card gets the card (in a two-player game). With more players, the first player gets two cards and the second one gets one card. After a certain number of rounds, the player with the most cards wins.<br/><br/>",

The remaining player has to question each in turn and try to guess what the common trait is from the way in which they respond. For the players that know the trait it produces a great deal of fun and amusement as well as a great deal of satisfaction for the questioner when and if they deduce the trait. Players build up their points to win the game by correctly guessing the trait within the allowed number of rounds.<br/><br/>The game can be played by 3 &ndash; 10 players and is suitable for all ages from 12 years and upwards. You can play it either as single players or in teams.<br/><br/>In addition to the full version of the game, we have also devised a &lsquo;Quick-Play&rsquo; version which is ideal for more impromptu situations such as travelling.<br/><br/>So, &lsquo;Sense of Identity&rsquo; will have families and friends, whether at home, on holiday or even travelling, roaring with laughter!<br/><br/>Sense of Identity <br/>A game you can play anywhere, anytime.<br/><br/>",

Since the roll of the dice is involved it assures that each and every game played is totally different than the previous games, creating exciting and unlimited variety.&quot;<br/><br/>The die roll determines which pieces move.  The six (Free  Flight) allows the movement of any piece.  The pieces are Omni (Queen), Digon (Bishop), Orthon (Rook), Trax (Pawn).  Diaginal taking of pieces, limited movement, and promotion are all part of the game.  There are also hazard spaces on the board.<br/><br/>",

        "description": "In the near-distant future, after years of war and famine, a global pandemic kills most of the world&rsquo;s population. Those that survive are transformed by the virus, unlocking a latent genetic code. Now, the world is ruled by the three original species of planet earth: Vampires, Werewolves and super Humans.<br/><br/>BANE is a three-suited competitive card game, where the suits represent powerful races (humans, vampires and werewolves), each hunting another, locked in a conflict for dominance. The Order of Prey (who hunts who) is similar to rock-paper-scissors:<br/><br/>     Humans hunt Werewolves<br/>     Werewolves hunt Vampires<br/>     Vampires hunt Humans<br/><br/><br/>Cards are played to a board in what is called an engagement. Similar to a trick-taking game, once all players put a card into play one winner is determined using the Order of Prey (described above). Cards also have a ranking, called Speed. Unlike other trick-taking games (such as Spades) a player may not play a card whose speed matches that of a card already in play - thus allowing players to 'speed block' other players. There are eight speeds, represented by numbers in the upper-left corner of each card.<br/><br/>Example: After all cards are played during an engagement, Bob sees that his Pack Alpha (Werewolf, Speed 1) is the fastest. He will thus be able to take a trophy from another player, as long as there is a Vampire in play (because Werewolves hunt Vampires).<br/><br/>Taking a trophy means that the player may choose from a pool of face-down cards in front of another player.<br/><br/>The round (Hunt) ends when one player is out of cards or trophies. At that time, the deck is shuffled and a new Hunt (round) begins.<br/><br/>WINNING THE GAME:<br/>Each player tracks their individual score. A Player wins by reaching the MASTERY space on the score track and having more trophies than opponents also in the MASTERY space.<br/><br/>There are other elements to the game that add flavor (Special Power cards, a BANE token).<br/><br/>",

Fires of destruction might rain down, eliminating cards from your opponent's stack, a divination will allow you to peak at your opponents stack before battle is resolved, or a mighty whirlwind might scatter creatures into each others stacks.<br/><br/>Battles commence, and the player with at least three out of five winning stacks takes control of one of five Elemental nodes.

After the player has delivered the package, he can verify if he has selected the correct room by flipping the card: on the back is a picture of an object - if that object is also depicted in the room, the package has been correctly delivered.<br/><br/>The game ends in a (shared) victory when all packages have been delivered.<br/><br/>",

The goofy monsters are molded from the colorful Play-Doh and players use a silly sneaker or boot smasher to mash them.  It&egrave;s giggly, squishy fun!<br/><br/>In Monster Smash, players mold as many monsters out of Play-Doh as they wish.  They will place a monster at each of the flying saucer spaces on the board.  Once a piece is moved, they replace it with another monster.  To move pieces, players use a spinner and depending on what color it lands on, they move that colored monster to the next space on the board.  If the player spins a smush or a double smush, they get to smush monsters on the board and remove them from the game.  If players eliminate all of the monsters from the game, they win.  If any three monsters reach the fridge space on the board, you lose!<br/><br/>",

        "description": "In the basic rules of Same One!, you're trying to dump your cards as quickly as you can, and whoever goes out first wins. The deck consists of 90 cards, numbered 1-30 in three colors. Cards 1-15 have up arrows while 16-30 have down arrows, and the most recent card played dictates whether the next card must be higher or lower. If you have more than one card of the same number, you can play them together. If you can't play a card, you draw a card, then play it if possible.<br/><br/>The rules for Same One! include four variants, and you can use one or more of them as you choose. In the simplest, you can't go out with a shark card (i.e. #13-18) on your final turn. Another variant requires that you match the color of the card last played, with sets of more than one number allowing you to change the required color.<br/><br/>Another variant has you playing multiple rounds and tracking the points won or lost by each player. When someone goes out, each other player loses as many points as the number of cards still in their hand while the one who went out gains points equal to the sum of points lost that round. If a player goes out with a 1 (the dog), then each player loses 10 points and that player wins 10 points per opponent.<br/><br/>With the final variant, if you have a number in hand that matches the number most recently played, you can play that card out of turn. This clears the pile, then you can play whichever card you want to start a new discard pile.<br/><br/>",

        "description": "Glory Gears is a historically accurate strategy game where 2 to 8 players control a race team of four riders and compete to be the first team to finish in a single or a series of races.  The game is inspired by Oscar Winning Movie, 'Breaking Away's' Little 500 Bicycle Race at Indiana University and created by Cutters Little 500 Champion Alex Bishop.<br/><br/>Glory Gears is an action packed, fast paced cycling strategy game with dynamic movement mechanics offering the most realistic gaming experience possible.  Besides a game that is incredibly historically accurate and movements that are mathematically correct, Glory Gears offers an amazingly fun play dynamic that evolves as players secretly choose to help others at times while other times breaking their friendships, alliances, and trust as the race draws closer to the end.  Added rules let you battle through wrecks, mechanicals, and secret team strategies while you create friends and foes racing your team of 4 riders around the track. However, as the checker flag approaches, there can only be one Glory Gears Champion!<br/><br/>Glory Gears has a multitude of optional rules and ways to play to ensure your gaming experience can be tailored to your liking. Everything from, rider stamina reductions, wrecks, dropping exchanges, mechanicals, playing out secret historical team strategies based off how specific teams won in certain years, to even playing out the entire spring race series events like in real life before the Little 500 event.  Players can choose to play out a historically accurate Qualifications run(great for 1 to 8 players), an Individual Time Trial(great for 1 to 8 players), and a Team Pursuit which involves all 4 riders of a team on the track racing against another at the same time (great 2 person game), or a fan and tournament favorite of the race series Miss N' Out, which states the last rider of each lap is eliminated until there is only one left!

Put your problem solving skills to the test with this clever guessing game!<br/><br/>The 'patient' picks an X-Ray card and places it in the sleeve to determine the hidden X-Ray picture for the round.  The 'Doctor' spins the spinner.  Depending on the result the doctor asks a yes or no question about the pictures characteristics (color, pattern, or object type).  Based on the answer, the doctor covers up results on the diagnostic board.  If the patient spins a bandage the doctor gets a bandage token.  After asking a question the doctor may make a guess at what the x-ray pictures is.  If they are correct, they get a bandage token. If they are wrong, the doctor gets a bandage token and the roles switch for the next round.  When all players have been the patient once, the game ends.  The player with the most bandage tokens wins!<br/><br/>",

        "description": "Gallia Cisalpina, a tactics game for 2 players from 10 years, is game No. 8 of the series &ldquo;Die Kleinen Feinen&rdquo;. <br/>In 396 BC, the Celts set out to conquer the lands south of the Alps, but the Romans are also fighting for supremacy. Defences are set up in a hurry to protect agriculture and ensure the supply of the warriors. But the enemy is also armed.<br/><br/>Only 12 cards form the landscape, on which the enemy troops stand in the form of dice. <br/>In his turn, each player has three opportunities. He is allowed to recruit up to 3 new warriors in his own capital, he can build (or destroy) defences in occupied areas - for this, the corresponding card is reversed and 2 warriors are reduced to pawns &ndash; and, of course, he can move the troops and attack the enemy.<br/><br/>The game principle is straightforward and intuitive and also suitable for casual players as an entry-level tactics game.<br/><br/>",

        "description": "The game is 120 cards depicting buildings, people, cars, trains, airport, river, and other city sites.<br/><br/>&quot;The [12] cards with the river are removed from the game [deck] and placed one against another, to form the right-hand edge.  The remaining cards are shuffled and each player is dealt 15 cards. Each player places his cards in front of himself openly. The rest of the cards are placed face down in a deck [draw pile] in the middle of the table.<br/><br/>The player on the left of the one who deals [the dealer] starts the game. The opening player places matching cards to the river cards already lying on the table. If he cannot join a card, he takes one from the covered deck [draw pile] and his left-hand neighbor continues. Each player may join all the matching cards he has [during his turn]. Cards can also be put in between the cards already lying on the table, if they match the others on both sides.<br/><br/>The left side has no limit, so with each game a new colorful city can be built.<br/><br/>The winner is the player who finishes first with his cards. He [or she] is the &quot;greater builder&quot;. You cannot always join all the cards. If at the end of the game there are still some cards left, the player with the fewest cards left wins.&quot;<br/><br/>The game was co-published by &quot;Spil og L&aelig;r&quot;, Danish for &quot;Play and Learn&quot;.<br/><br/>",

Help baby pigs locate the pigpen, baby ducks waddle to the pond, baby horses trot to the hayfield, and baby sheep back to their pasture. The game introduces children to counting and identifying baby and adult animals. Counting is especially fun as the players make animal sounds for each animal they move. Everyone wins in this cooperative game when each baby animal has been reunited with its adult animal!<br/><br/>",
