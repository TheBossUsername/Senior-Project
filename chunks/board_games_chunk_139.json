Unlike most games within the genre, Shadows in the Void focuses on stealth, electronic warfare, and the interactions between spacecraft in your squadron. It certainly is not a &ldquo;Red Baron in space&rdquo; ruleset &ndash; you won&rsquo;t see many dogfights during the battles. Why would advanced war machines of the far future use tactics which became obsolete in mid-20th century? Of course, they look very appealing on screen, but not necessarily on the gaming table.<br/><br/>At the moment of release, the miniature range will cover all units from two of the five races, with the remaining ones released gradually in later waves. The miniature scale of choice is 3mm, and the Shadows in the Void range is designed to be compatible with Odział &Oacute;smy PSF 1/600 sci-fi range. The miniatures will be produced in small series, with frequent additions of new versions of earlier units &ndash; it&rsquo;s boring to sell the same miniatures all time, isn&rsquo;t it?<br/><br/>&mdash;description from the publisher<br/><br/>",

These highly trained soldiers needed a new vehicle to do their job safely, and they were rewarded with the Medium Combat Walker Recon Mickey III. This lightly armed walker should not be treated lightly! As its turret was removed, it gained tremendous speed while still mounting a few machine guns for close ground and air defense and a powerful recoiless rifle to deal with any heavier target. The highly trained crew of a Recon Mickey III is very capable of calling in an airstrike or an artillery strike on enemy positions, making it invaluable to any Allied army. The walker is presented here in desert pattern, as used in North Africa and the Middle-East circa 1947.<br/><br/>&mdash;description from the publisher<br/><br/>",

In the feasting hall, the mortals try to impress the gods with their tales of battle, wits and folly!<br/> Each round, one player is a Norse god, and the rest of the players are mortals trying to get the god to choose their tale over the others. The tales are a combination of an Action card, the feat they performed, and a Challenge card, the obstacle they faced. Players guess the type of tale that god would want to hear most and lay the cards before them. The god will read the tales and choose one they wish to hear told aloud. That mortal wins the favor of the god and gets to tell their tale. The player who impresses the gods the most wins! What's your tale?<br/><br/>",

So, for example, water beats fire, but is beaten by earth. Water and air meet as allies.<br/><br/>The rules are straightforward and the moves are basically simple, which is why players can quickly find themselves in the game. However, due to its special set of rules, Quattele offers a high degree of tactical challenge. The players have to attack as well as try to defend the opposing, allied element from the attacks of the opponents.<br/><br/>If you manage to reduce the 10 pieces of the opponent's elements by hitting them to 3 or to occupy the middle of the opponent's starting field, you win the battle of the elements.<br/><br/>&mdash;description from the publisher<br/><br/>",

It has educational content, but the real focus is on fun, competition, and endlessly creative and varied gameplay.  The theme is based on organic farming, and the goal is to collect Hunger Tokens by growing organic vegetables on your farm, and feeding local communities. If you play strategically and negotiate successfully with fellow players, or Growers, you can increase your odds of doing well at the Farmer's Market, which dictates crop values and market pricing.  <br/>     Game-play consists of turn-based die rolls, accompanied by trading between turns.  Multiple events may occur on die rolls, allowing for a nonlinear and more engaging style of play.  Players, or Growers, must adapt on the fly to ever-changing in-game conditions.  A Grower may only score an OOF-DAH! if they grow the right crops on the right cover crops, and if they harvest the correct crops according to the ideal growing season.<br/>     Additional scoring opportunities are facilitated by novel features such as 2 Crop Combos, Undercutting, and targeted Marker Token protections.  Only the savviest Growers with the keenest sense of what's hot and what's not in the Market, will meet all challenges, earning the right to say, &quot;OOF-DAH!&quot;<br/><br/>",

Other spaces cause the players to draw a card and follow the instructions printed there. The players try to fulfill their goal by going through any number of different detours. On finishing a detour, the player gets a movement card, that he may use instead of rolling the die at a time of his own choosing.<br/><br/>The player who gets to his pre-set goal first wins the game.<br/><br/>",

When The Beast's total anger value reaches the breaking point, he RAGES and destroys all houses adjacent to his.<br/><br/>Each player must manage when and where The Beast rages, thus destroying the houses around him. The ultimate goal is to have more of your opponents' houses destroyed than yours. When The Beast lives in one of your houses, you actually gain points. When The Beast lives next to one of your houses, there's risk of him destroying them in a fit of rage, costing you points. All other houses out of harm's way (not adjacent to The Beast) tally point values as well. The player with the most points wins the game.<br/><br/>",

        "description": "NeoParadise: Rampage is a card game set in a science fiction, dark fantasy, post-apocalyptic world where 4 factions slaughter each other for &quot;survival&quot;.<br/><br/>Main Features<br/><br/>     The 4 groups have different play styles but that's not all. Each faction either adds or changes a rule of the game to their advantage, but that's not all! Each faction also possess a different resource system!<br/>     How to win, during the match players will play buildings (one of the 3 card types) to form their &quot;base&quot;. This constructions can be damaged and the moment your enemy has no more of them in the field, you win.<br/>     We have 2 ways of playing, one in which you play with your deck in 1 pile, and another in which you separate your deck in 2 piles. You can choose from which pile you draw your card each turn. This decreases luck and increases strategy.<br/><br/><br/>Comments from the designer:<br/><br/>A big part of the game is that all factions are broken and fragile at the same time. All of them can win or lose against all of the others in a ridiculous way, specially when you get the hang of it.<br/><br/>In this game we have 3 card types, Units, Buildings and Interventions. Units represent your &quot;troops&quot;, Buildings make your base and Interventions are standalone effects. You can't cancel enemy effects in this game, only normal attacks from <br/>Units.<br/><br/>While it's not difficult to learn, specially if you have played other card games, the fact that every faction is so different might make you feel you are learning 4 games at the same time...Might.<br/><br/>Also, when it comes to playing times, the one registered is the standard. But sometimes, specially when you really grasp the game and you get top level luck: you can get a 3 minute match... This happened only once during testing, quite a funny thing it was. And also, if you have no idea whatsoever and get terrible luck it can stretch up to an hour and a half. Only in those circunstances.<br/><br/>",

They can either agree to a specific theme, voice, or tense, or they can have no such agreement at all. Then one player, known as the moderator, tells each player who to send his story fragment to. Each player will send his fragment to two different players, one with the subject &quot;first&quot; and the other with the subject &quot;last&quot;. After a player receives a &quot;first&quot; and a &quot;last&quot; from other players, he must write a transition that connects the two story fragments together. The completed work is sent back to the moderator with the subject &quot;transition&quot;, and the moderator puts together the complete story, linking fragment to transition to fragment to transition, and so on. The result is a story that loops, and is usually quite disconnected.<br/><br/>",

        "description": "UFM: Football Highlights is the first game of the series of board games about the football (soccer) club management.<br/><br/>It's about the best moments of football matches.<br/><br/>You are the manager of one of the two underdog (mediocre) clubs which eager to be real glory hunters.<br/><br/>In the game, you have to determine the formation of footballers on the field, give instructions to players, strengthen the team by newcomers, learn and use new formations. There are referees, red cards, injuries, penalties, substitutions and everything is like in real football.<br/><br/>You have to rise from mediocre team to the winner of the first UFM trophy - Underdogs Cup.<br/><br/>Game components are divided into 5 envelopes. In each of those is the card of the referee appointed for the upcoming match, new or additional components, as well as brief rules on how to use them. The scenario and rules will become more complicated with the growth of your experience. In the final you have to fight for the Underdogs Cup.<br/><br/>In first envelope you get team with 15 players and the most popular formation 4-4-2. Each player has attack and defend skills. There are also cards &quot;match events&quot; and referee card. Every referee has own preferences. First one is loyal. There are in the game different referees: strict, very strict, unfair, undecided, etc.<br/><br/>You don't need to play full match. Instead of it you have to play 3 attacks, named &quot;highlights&quot;, in every time of match. &quot;Highlight&quot; is finished when goal scored or team lost the ball. All footballers lay face down in starting formation and attacking manager choose one of them and open his card. Defending manager choose one of his players and open his card in front of attacking player. Then they roll dices (d10) and add result to attack and defend accordingly to their players. After each &quot;highlight&quot; you have to open &quot;match event&quot; card. And make all actions from it. Every effect of &quot;match events&quot; depends on the referee of the match.<br/><br/>In the next envelopes you get &quot;team instructions&quot; cards which helps to affect actions at the field and to decrease random.<br/><br/>After completing the scenario with Underdogs Cup, you will get more freedom to act. You can open the last envelope with additional formations, referees, and game currency. For this money you can buy your own players. There will be also stickers to improve skills of your players and tournament cards for playing your own tournaments.<br/><br/>Underdog - the weakest of two or more rivals. Literally meaning is &quot;lower dog&quot;. The term arose by the end of the XIX century in the US during the dog fights. Often losing dog usually lies next to the paws of the winner or literally under it. The more surprising thing was its unexpected victory over a strong opponent.<br/><br/>&mdash;description from the publisher<br/><br/>",

These tribes each prioritises two of the four points (Money, Health, fun and Goodwill) and are then rewarded at the end of the game for having 'lived' according to their 'tribes' priorities.<br/><br/>The game is competitive and cooperative, which creates a warm atmosphere and brings out the best in players.<br/><br/>The game is a two sided board, where players throw the dice and move around the board along the path. When players throw doubles they may move forward or backwards. There are 3 levels of play, from 13+ (younger with assistance). The game takes approximately 2 hrs, depending on how much discussions people have.  The game player numbers are three to six. Five players are optimal.<br/><br/>The goal of the game is to earn priority points by making decisions based on your tribal priorities. Lower value points may be traded with other players, thus creating an opportunity to cooperation with other players for a win/win outcome.<br/><br/>&mdash;description from the designer<br/><br/>",

Rail is king in this city on the grow. As a power broker, your pockets are lined by train companies competing to build the new elevated rail system, &ldquo;The Loop.&rdquo; In this game, players work together to build the loop while hiding which line they work for, because everyone is scheming for a big piece of this corruption pie.<br/> In the Loop is a 2-4 player game of puzzle building, tactical planning, and secret motives.<br/><br/>Objective: Line your pockets by connecting lines and working to make your line the best. You earn money in two ways: during gameplay, you earn money by connecting lines to route cards. After the game has finished, you earn additional money from the syndicate you secretly work for. Don&rsquo;t let other players deduce who you&rsquo;re working for or they will try to block you. The game ends shortly after the Loop has been completed.<br/> Quick gameplay summary: On your turn, you will place two line cards and one route card. You can also spend your money to make bribes to buy cards or remove previously played cards. Keep in mind that the winner is the player with the most money in the end, so spend wisely! Each turn, you will earn money for each line that connects to the route card you played, and at the end of the game, you will earn money for each time your line appears and each time it connects to a station.

        "description": "&quot;As God may help, it appears to me that all the flower and honor of chivalry is there, most wisely and expertly drawn up.&quot; -- John Chandos, before the Battle of Auray (29 September 1364)<br/><br/>The Hundred Years War (1337 to 1453) was a dynastic struggle between the English house of Plantagenet and the French house of Valois for control of the French throne. Armies from across Europe would ally with these families, spreading combat as far from Gascony as Scotland and Portugal. Chivalry rose and fell on the backs of personalities like the Black Prince, Charles the Bad, and Pedro the Cruel, fought over battlefields at Cre&ccedil;y, Poitiers, and Agincourt. By the end of this period, the military code of chivalry would be in ashes and from those would be born the nations of England and France.<br/><br/>Chivalry At Bay is a low to medium complexity game depicting many of the individual battles that made up the Hundred Years War. Players control armies involved in each conflict that attempt to drive their opponent from the field of battle. Each battle can be completed in roughly two hours, allowing several battles to be played in a single sitting. The game takes several novel approaches toward simulating these eighteen individual battles:<br/><br/>LA CAPELLE (HYPOTHETICAL) - 23 October 1339<br/>SAINT-OMER - 26 July 1340<br/>MORLAIX - 30 September 1342<br/>AUBEROCHE - 21 October 1345<br/>BLANCHETAQUE - 24 August 1346<br/>CRE&Ccedil;Y - 26 August 1346<br/>NEVILLE&rsquo;S CROSS - 17 October 1346<br/>CASSEL - 8 June 1347<br/>B&Eacute;THUNE - 13 June 1347<br/>POITIERS - 19 September 1356<br/>COCHEREL - 16 May 1364<br/>AURAY - 29 September 1364<br/>NAJERA - 3 April 1367<br/>PONTVALLAIN - 4 December 1370<br/>ROOSEBEKE - 27 November 1382<br/>ALJUBARROTA - 14 August 1385<br/>HUMBLETON HILL - 14 September 1402<br/>AGINCOURT - 25 October 1415<br/><br/>Rather than the typical hex-based movement system, Chivalry At Bay uses a map that is broken up into three individual columns (or &quot;battles&quot; to use the historical term), each of which is made up of five &quot;ranks&quot; ranging from a friendly rear area, to and advance area, central area, through the enemy advance and rear areas. Units move backwards and forwards through these areas to more accurately simulate the type of movement that took place historically as waves of knights and men-at-arms advanced and were thrown back by enemy defenders (such as the feared English bowmen). Special terrain tiles may be placed in specific areas to more accurately simulate the ground over which the armies fought.<br/><br/>Combat is a simple process involving a &quot;buckets-of-dice&quot; system where &quot;hits&quot; on enemy units are based upon a unit's ability rating. Units range from lowly levies to the cream of chivalry, the French knight. Also represented are long bowmen, crossbowmen, men-at-arms, bill and pikemen, and light cavalry. Units that take hits may withdraw towards their friendly areas or hold their position and be ground down by the enemy onslaught. Units that have sustained enough damage may rout from the field!<br/><br/><br/>The core of the game system is a deck of action cards. Each card provides a random number of command points that army leaders use to activate units on the battlefield to advance into engagement or withdraw before they're destroyed. The number of cards a player has available is based upon the quality of the army leadership. Several of these cards also allow the opportunity for players to &quot;purchase&quot; temporary army enhancements such as increased unit ratings or combat bonuses or even events that can shift the momentum of a battle.<br/><br/>In addition to the eighteen historical battles depicted, Chivalry At Bay provides players the ability to quickly and easily create their own custom armies to experiment with tactics and fight out battles on their own terms.<br/><br/>From La Capelle to Agincourt, relive the blood and glory of the Hundred Years War with Chivalry At Bay!<br/><br/>SUN OF YORK OWNERS!

The game is divided in two periods of 7 rounds each. During the first period, from 494 to 480 BC, the Persians are on the offensive, unleashing their invasion in Asia Minor, Thrace and the rest of the Greek peninsula, with their goal to conquer citites from their secret Objective card, while the Greeks try to prevent them from doing so. Once the first period is over, the Persian side announces the number of cities conquered from its objective. Moving to the second period, from 480 o 466 BC, the Greeks mount a counterattack, in an attempt to liberate as many cities as they can from their secret Objective card. In a similar fashion, the Persians try to prevent the Greeks from achieving their goal. With the second period over, the Greek side announces the number of cities liberated from its objective. The number of cities conquered/liberated are compared and the side with the most cities conquered/liberated wins the game.<br/><br/>&mdash;description from the publisher<br/><br/>",

We have probed deep into the dirty pasts of people to compile hundreds of ludicrous life choices that we can all relate to.<br/> The game is played with Confession Cards, which are examples of ludicrous life choices, and Rule Cards which tell you how to play each round - that make it easy and fun to learn who&rsquo;s the craziest, dirtiest, wildest friend of the group!<br/><br/>Every round, a player selects a Red Rule Card from the top of the pile, reads the instructions aloud and must then do as the Rule Card says.<br/> If you are guilty of an act detailed by a Blue Confession Card given to you, you must add it to your losing pile (face up) in front of you until the end of the game, so that everyone can enjoy reliving your bad decisions. If you are not guilty of a Confession Card, you must scrap it.<br/> The first player to have 10 Confession Cards in their losing pile loses the game. There are no winners in this game, only losers.<br/><br/>&mdash;description from the publisher<br/><br/>",

        "description": "You are an ambitious jarl of a small tribe of Vikings. Only featly leading your people and steering your tribe to wealth and prosperity you will be able to become a respected leader of your people! Improving your settlement, pillaging the villages and building the temples in the name of Odin, gain glory and become the legend, perpetuated in a Viking saga.<br/><br/>In Lords of the Fjords, you start your game in a poor village with just one ship at the pier and a couple of sellswords. Each turn, the players take from the сloth bag the specified number of meeples that exist in three different colors. Each of three colors means a certain type of specialists and for your turn you have to choose only one one color to perform one type of action: Builders (yellow) allow you to build new ships and temples; Counsellors (blue) are great at diplomatic and trade affairs, which can attract new skilled people to your village, which is necessary for its growth; while Warriors (red), for sure, are needed to attack other villages (because no Viking can live his life without tough fights and glorious victories).<br/><br/>Starting the game with identical resources, all players must find their own strategy towards the glory. Building new ships and temples brings you more gold and victory points respectively. Improving your facilities allows you to get more actions on your future turns, hire new sellswords that will fight for you to the last breath, or even send an intruder that will get in the way of your opponents and steal their gold for you.<br/><br/>Conquering unexplored lands you can achieve everything at once: get some useful bonuses, do some extra actions of other types on the same turn and gain the victory points. But you should be careful attacking the villages - most of tribes will call for help of their neighbours when you try to pillage their lands and some of them can also be protected by high palisade.<br/><br/>Lords of the Fjords is a simple but involving game of strategy that combines different game mechanisms.<br/><br/>&mdash;description from the publisher<br/><br/>",

Saki is a master at the art of suggestion, without uttering a word she can draw the attention of any unlucky enough to be selected for her wiles, stumbling blindly after her in the heat of battle.<br/>&mdash;description from the publisher<br/><br/>",

Oda likes nothing more than to drill and sculpt his famous Buto into pure weapons of mass and muscle. His physique might prevent him from demonstrating his extensive knowledge of the art of Jumo but he is a skilled and quick teacher, barking instructions and jabbing directions with his ornate fan, swiftly turning even the amateur into a competent wrestler and a warrior into a master. Tautolu is never far from his diminutive master, either stepping forward to clear his path through the streets of Jima and saddling his famous platform, allowing his sensei a better vantage point from which to command his men. Keenly aware of danger and quickly removing threats with a crushingly accurate and brutal blow from his tetsubo, Tautolu is the bite to Oda&rsquo;s bark.<br/>&mdash;description from the publisher<br/><br/>",

        "description": "In Short: Token-based social deduction game.<br/><br/>In Full: Sanctus Malum pits the power of a few against the might of many in this twist on a social deduction game. Acting as a Guardian, you aid angels in ascending to their rightful place. Or are you an Imp in disguise, corrupting the virtuous?<br/><br/>Players are attempting to free Recruit Tokens (double-sided tokens in the center of the playing field), with one side representing Angel Recruits, and the other side representing Demon Recruits. Freed recruits are removed from the game and cannot be flipped to the other side. The Guardian's team goal is to have a majority of freed Angel Recruits; the Imp's team goal is to have a majority of freed Demon Recruits.<br/> One player is assigned the role of Justice, and receives the Justice token and the Action Card deck (to shuffle). The Justice role moves to the player on this first Justice's left at the beginning of every round. The Justice will make important decisions that affect the outcome of every round, and ultimately the outcome of the game.<br/><br/>Each player, including the Justice, is dealt an Alignment Card - which makes them either a Guardian or an Imp - and a Power Card (they may look at their cards, but must keep them secret). Power Cards give the player either a single-use power, a information trade power, the ability to &quot;mark&quot; a player, or the ability to give your team an extra point at the end of the game. These cards help add an extra level of complexity and strategy to the game.<br/><br/>During the start of gameplay, Action Cards are introduced to the group. The Justice deals two Action Cards to every player, who may look at them, talk about them, but must keep them hidden from other players. Players may play both Action Cards or play one and discard the other.<br/><br/>Action Cards affect the Recruit Tokens:<br/><br/><br/>     Rise takes a single Angel Recruit out of the pool and frees it<br/>     Redeem changes a Demon Recruit into an Angel Recruit <br/>     Truce does nothing<br/>     Corrupt changes two Angel Recruits into Demon Recruits<br/>     Fall takes frees two Demon Recruits.<br/><br/><br/>Justice's Decision: After all players have made their decisions on which Action Cards to play or discard, the Justice may swap players' Action Cards, up to the number of Imps in the game (so, if there are 3 Imps in the game, the Justice may swap up to three players' Action Cards). If a player plays both of their cards, the Justice can now discard both; if a player plays one and discards the other, the Justice can swap those cards around so the discarded one is now played.<br/><br/>The only way for a player to voluntarily discard both of their cards is for them to appeal to the Justice, hoping that the Justice will believe them when they claim that the cards will only do harm to their team.<br/><br/>Reveal: After the Justice has made their decisions, all played cards are collected and given face-down to the Justice, who shuffles them together. All discarded cards, and the remaining Action Card deck, are given to the player on the Justice's left (also face-down).<br/><br/>The Justice reveals the played cards one at a time, enacting the rules on each, continuing until all cards have been followed. At any time, if one team reaches their win condition, the game is over, and players may reveal their alignments.<br/><br/>Justice's Investigation: The final major piece to the game is the Justice's Investigation - on the round that the 10th Recruit is freed (regardless of Alignment, instead a total count of freed Recruits), the Justice chooses a player and secretly looks at that player's Alignment Card - beware, however, that there are Power Cards that may affect the Justice's decision and the outcome! The Justice may be truthful or lie about that player's alignment.<br/><br/>At the end of a round, the Justice role moves to the player to the left, and it all starts over again.<br/><br/>Whichever faction gets the most Recruit Tokens on their side wins the game! Supports up to 15 players.<br/><br/>",

The Imperial Japanese Army is consolidating its position after almost 16 years of war, first with China, then in a brief struggle with the Soviet Union and later against the US and British Commonwealth. With major gains on the Asian mainland and still holding territory across the Pacific, the Japanese Army is under pressure but holding firm.<br/><br/>New Rift-tech weaponry is appearing in greater numbers and the Allies political uncertainty plays to Japan&rsquo;s advantage. The fortitude and fanaticism of the Japanese soldier remains a potent force, but it&rsquo;s the Rift-tech Scorpion light walker that terrifies its enemies, a stealthy machine with a powerful weapon load. As Walker technology advances, the humble tank may become obsolete, but in the meantime, the Rift-tech weaponry upgrades keep the proven Type 97-Kai Shinhoto Chi-Ha in the front line, its compression cannon capable of defeating infantry and Allied tanks alike.<br/><br/>This Konflikt '47 starter set provides the men and machines needed to finally push the Allies out of Asia and ensure the domination for the Emperor.<br/><br/>&mdash;desription from the publisher<br/><br/>",

Choose to specialize and grow more powerful in certain attributes, or expand your versatility with a greater variety of skills.<br/><br/>Designed by a role-player for role-players,this board game offers steadily-building character development and a variety of attributes including: strength, dexterity, constitution, intelligence, wisdom and charisma.<br/><br/>Likewise, the available classes --Paladin, Mage, Priest, Thief and Ranger--  include 20 skills as well as 6 companions who can be hired for each of the quests.<br/><br/>The fighting system is direct, so that skills can be used to their full potential. <br/>The standard attack is carried out with an attack roll and compared to the monster's defense. <br/>In contrast, many skills have nothing to do with throwing dice, but require the party to come up with a plan.<br/><br/>Each story contains a storybook with over 25 scenarios, 20 monsters and battle slides for some scenarios. The variety of these monsters guarantees for a constant difficulty level.<br/>We recommend playing  5 scenarios, which will take about 1 hour per player, and then taking a break until your next game night.<br/><br/>Every game in The Cheap Chapel is different. Apart from different stories, decisions in one game can influence the course of the next game, not including the incredible number of possibilities to customize your character.<br/><br/>Choose your character, roll starting attributes, put on your gear and go on an adventure.<br/><br/>The world of The Cheap Chapel awaits you.<br/><br/>",

Take the CITY or PLANET scene of your choice, together with the appropriate playing piece and game cards. Place the scene and the playing piece in the centre of the table and put the game cards in a pile. Pick a game card from the pack, then place it in front of you. The players must try to solve the game card at the same time. To plot your course, place the bars closest to you directly onto the board (instead of on the card). When a player thinks they have found the right solution they must say &ldquo;STOP&rdquo;. If you have placed the bars on the board correctly you keep the card. If not, the other player gets to keep the card. Continue the game by choosing another game card. The winner is the first person to get 3 cards.<br/><br/>",

Cards are played face down, while players claim them to be one of the monsters in the game. It's up to other players to determine if each play is a bluff. Play continues until either one player has played all their cards, or the draw pile is exhausted.<br/><br/>During their turn, players have a choice of making a boast, calling the previous player a Lygari, or just drinking mead. When making a boast, a player plays any number of cards from their hand, face down, and claims them to be one of the 13 monsters in the game. If the next player calls their bluff, the cards are revealed. If they matched the previous player's claim, the calling player must take all cards played so far into their hand, otherwise, the lying player takes all cards played into their hand. A player may instead opt to &quot;pass&quot; by drinking mead and drawing a card from the stock. When the mead runs out (all cards are drawn), whoever has the fewest cards left in their hand is the winner!<br/><br/>Lygari! is the second in a series of games from Green Fairy Studios LLC in a shared setting of Mystique, where beings from ancient myth return to our modern day world. Lygari! highlights just some of the fantasical beings from Yggdrasil, the Nine Worlds of Norse myth!<br/><br/>&mdash;description from the publisher<br/><br/>",

The object of the game is to travel through the solar system landing on the planets and moon and collecting valuable ore or precious stones. The winner is the player with the most valuable riches upon returning to earth.<br/><br/>The game requires players to choose a spaceship that looks more like a plane and traverse the solar system by the move of a single die along a path of small white stars. The journey takes them on a path to the Moon, Venus, Saturn, Mars and Jupiter before returning to Earth.<br/><br/>Whats interesting about the game is that 3 of the planets (Venus, Jupiter and Mars) rotate slowly during play by turning a disk and players have to align their ship towards the next path to move onto another planet.<br/><br/>On arrival on the moon and planets players acquire cards with valuable ore and gemstones. The value of each card is determined by who arrives there first.<br/><br/>The other interesting feature is a fast moving comet that orbits the players course by the throw of 2 dice. If a player collides with the comet a penalty such as loss of riches or even elimination from the game occurs.<br/><br/>After collecting the precious cargo from the planets and returning to Earth players are awarded bonus cards in order of arrival.

Master Merchant, Lord of Maritime or Lord Governor. Master Merchant requires a player to have 150g and dock at a port owned by their nationality. Admiral of the Seas requires a player to have 3 ship cards in his fleet and capture or buy a forth. Lord Governor requires a player to place his last nations port marker on the board.<br/><br/>For a more challenging and longer game the number of objectives a player needs to win can be raised to 2 or all 3.<br/><br/>Once a player has met an objective their turn immediately ends, however the round is not over and continues giving other player the opportunity to complete an objective. At the end of the round if more than one player has managed to complete all objectives needed to win, victory points are awarded (see below) to decide a winner, the highest scorer ultimately wins the game, if in the rare circumstances there is a draw, they can decide to accept a draw or both fleets can combat until one side loses a ship giving victory to the winner.<br/><br/>&mdash;description from the designer<br/><br/>",

It was adapted from Des chiffres et des lettres.<br/><br/>The object of the game is to be the player with the highest number of points after nine rounds: six word games, two number games, and one conundrum.<br/><br/>Playing the game<br/><br/>The Word Game<br/>Vowel and consonant cards are shuffled separately and placed face down in two piles. Taking turns, players 'call' either &quot;consonant&quot; or &quot;vowel&quot;. A card from the corresponding pile is placed on the playing mat until all nine spaces have been filled. Players then attempt to form words using the letters before the timer runs out, with no letter being used more than once. The player with the longest word gets a point for each letter in the word, or 18 points if all the letters were used.<br/><br/>The Number Game<br/>A randomiser is used to generate a number between 0 and 999. Players take turns calling for &quot;high&quot; or &quot;low&quot; value cards until Any or all of the selected number cards can be used to reach the target number, but numbers can only be used once. Permitted calculations are addition, subtraction, multiplication, and division.<br/>When the timer runs out, players announce their numbers. The player with the number closest to the target is awarded points as follows (provided the calculations were correct):<br/>10 points for reaching the target, 7 points if within 5 (inclusive), 5 points if within 10 (inclusive), 0 if beyond 10.<br/><br/>The Conundrum round<br/>A list of 275 jumbled up nine-letter words are provided in the rule sheet. The first person to guess the anagram scores 10 points.<br/><br/>Winning<br/>The contestant with the most points at the end of all nine rounds is the winner.<br/><br/>",

        "description": "A board game based on the 1987 Science Fiction movie. One player is the Runners. The other is the Stalkers.<br/> The board is an 8x8 grid known as the Game Zone.  There are 4 main locations located in the corners: Runner Entry, Stalker Entry, Satellite Uplink and Rebel Hideout. The centre 4 squares are known as the Intersection. In order to go from any corner location to any other corner location, you must first enter an intersection space.<br/><br/>There are 4 Runners: Ben Richards, William Laughlin, Harold Weiss and Amber Mendez. There are 5 Stalkers: Subzero, Buzzsaw, Dynamo, Fireball and Captain Freedom. Characters have 2, 3, 4 or 5 hits. When a character takes damage a damage counter is placed on it. If a character has more damage counters than hits, it is killed.<br/><br/>Runners and Stalkers start the game at differing stages:<br/><br/>      At the start of the game the Richards, Laughlin, and Weiss counters are placed on the Runner entry square. Subzero starts on the Stalker entry point. Mendez enters the game on turn 4. <br/>     If Subzero is killed, both Dynamo and Buzzsaw immediately enter the game zone otherwise Dynamo and Buzzsaw enter on turn 6.<br/>     If both Dynamo and Buzzsaw are killed, Fireball immediately enters, otherwise Fireball enters on turn 10. <br/>     If Fireball is killed, Captain Freedom immediately enters play, otherwise Captain Freedom enters on turn 14. <br/><br/><br/>Each player has a unique deck of cards comprising, Move, Attack, Defence and Special cards.  Players take turns to draw three cards, place them in their hand and then play cards to move their own units and attack opposing units. <br/><br/>     Move cards are used (discarded) to manoeuvre a player&rsquo;s units around the board.  A unit may make a max of 2 moves in a turn and must move the entire distance described by the move card or not at all.  <br/>     Attack cards are used to make attacks against opposing units in the same space. A unit may make up to 2 attacks in a turn. <br/>     Defence cards are played to negate an attack.<br/><br/><br/>The game ends when all Stalkers are killed or all Runners are either killed or escaped. <br/><br/>     The Stalkers win if all of the Runners are killed. <br/>     The Runners get a minor victory if 1 or more of them make it to the Rebel Hideout. <br/>     The runners get a major victory if 1 or more of them makes it first to the Satellite Uplink and then the Hideout. <br/><br/><br/>&mdash;user summary<br/><br/>",

        "description": "A card game for 2-4+ players in which each player represents a separate group of Preppers who are preparing for the end of the world. Players accumulate supplies and advantages in several different categories.  While this goes on players eliminate different end of the world scenarios until only one remains. The remaining scenario will favour certain types of stockpile categories which will determine victory conditions.<br/><br/>There are 2 common decks: <br/><br/>     Stockpile Deck: This deck contains 10 cards in each of 13 different stockpile categories: Weapons, Food, Animals, Vehicles, Plants, Knowledge, Medicine, Shelter, Trade, Water, Power, Cold and Equipment. Each category of cards has two cards each of values 3 to 7.<br/>     Scenario Deck: The scenario deck contains 20 cards giving a description of the stockpile categories advantageous in overcoming it (e.g. Zombie Apocalypse = Weapons x3, Vehicles x3)<br/><br/><br/>To start flip over all the scenario cards face up and spread them over the centre of the table so that all of them are visible.  The top 5 cards of the stockpile deck are also flipped.<br/><br/>There are 3 stages: <br/><br/>     Prepping Stage: Players take turns with to flip over the top card of the stockpile deck and take 1 of the face-up stockpile cards and put it face-down in their stockpile. Players can look at their own stockpile cards but not their opponents. Move to Scenario Stage if there are no more face-up stockpile cards. <br/>     Scenario Stage: Players take turns to pick one of the face-up scenario cards and put it face-down in a discard pile. When there is only one scenario left, it becomes the End of the World Scenario (EOTWS) and play continues to the scoring stage. <br/>     Scoring Stage: The EOTWS will list categories that receive a bonus card value multiplier. For example: if it is the Zombie Apocalypse, all your Weapons cards and Vehicle cards are worth 3 times as much.  For every category you have zero cards in, get -5 points. Your final score is equal to the total point value of all your stockpile cards. <br/><br/><br/>The player with the highest score at the end of the game wins.<br/><br/>",

        "description": "It's a Thursday afternoon on the Plain of Shinar, and once again there is nothing to do. (History hasn't been invented yet much less bowling!) It looks like another wasted day. But then one of your buddies has a bright idea! &quot;Let's build a tower all the way up to heaven!&quot; he says. &quot;Sure, I've got nothing better to do&quot; you reply. And so the legend begins . . .<br/><br/>Building Babel is a card game for 3-6 players in which, working together, they try to successfully build the fabled Tower of Babel. In so doing players will also be trying to get more recognition for their efforts than the others do. Throughout the process God will be trying to stop them?<br/><br/>All that is required is 1 deck of playing cards and a handful of markers/tokens for each player. The cards are considered to be of two types &ndash; &ldquo;Brick&rdquo; cards (2 to J) which are used to construct the Tower, and &ldquo;Act of God&rdquo; cards (Q, K, A) which disrupt the construction process.<br/><br/>The deck is shuffled and a hand of cards dealt to each player (hand size is determined by the number of players). The rest of the cards form a draw pile.<br/><br/>Players take it in turns to play as follows:<br/><br/>     The active player plays a valid &quot;Brick&quot; Card on the Tower. These must be placed in order. The base of the tower is a row of four 2s. Next up will be the 3s and so on until the top row is filled with the Jacks. There must always be at least two more cards on any uncompleted level below the one being played to. If a player completes a row in the tower, they place one of their tokens beside it. This will show who put the most effort into the project, come the end of the game!<br/>     If they cannot play a &quot;Brick&quot; card the active player must play an &ldquo;Act of God&rdquo; card (if they have one).  The effect of the cards are as follows:<br/>         ACES: The next player misses their turn.<br/>         QUEEN: The order of game play is reversed (e.g. from left to right.)<br/>         KING: The last &ldquo;Brick&rdquo; Card played is taken off the tower and is shuffled into the draw pile.  Additionally when the first King card is played all game related talking between players must stop due to confusion of the languages.  When the fourth King card is played the game is over! <br/>    <br/>     When the player has played their card (Brick or Act of God) they pick up the top card of the draw pile, their turn is over and play passes to the next player.<br/>     If they have no &ldquo;Brick&rdquo; or &ldquo;Act of God&quot; card to play the player must pass their turn. If the player was forced to pass their turn they cannot draw a card. On the turn after a player has passed, they may choose to shuffle up to half of their cards (round down) into the draw pile and replace them with an equal number then drawn from the top of the deck. That player's turn is then over.<br/><br/><br/>Play continues until the tower is completed or the fourth King appears at which point God stops the project.  In the event that tower is finished all players win, but the player with the most tokens beside the Tower is the big winner!  However, if the fourth King card is played before this happens then everyone loses but the player with the most tokens beside the tower is the biggest loser for have put so much effort into a failed project.<br/><br/>",

Treasure and danger alike await your warbands, as they travel through the waterlogged city in search of the shards of the meteor that struck down the once-mighty port city and drove it beneath the waves.<br/><br/>Star-Struck City is a skirmish game, designed around playing with small warbands of 5-15 models on a 4&prime; x 4&prime; table loaded with terrain. Warband members advance, gaining new skills, equipment, and injuries as they survive the rigors of battle in this deadly locale. Climb up buildings and run between rooftops, leap down to ambush enemies from above, hire war machines and epic heroes from the Kings of War armies, and build your warband&rsquo;s reputation as the fiercest and toughest fighters in all of Mantica.<br/><br/>The rules are based heavily on Kings of War, so players of the full-size wargame should feel right at home. It&rsquo;s heavily inspired by other skirmish games such as Mordheim, but with the ease-of-play the Kings of War rules provide so gameplay is quick and decisive.<br/><br/>As the surviving veterans of The Star-Struck City have said: Perditus now only offers riches or death.

As a child, she saw faint lights which she knew came from Beyond. To guard her from judgment, her father kept her isolated. Asami grew lonely and yearned for the day she would have a family of her own.<br/><br/>Following an attack on her family shrine, she lost not only her father but also her fertility, and with it, the hope of creating her own family. Mortally wounded, Asami let the Amanjaku inside her soul, bestowing her with the bestial power of the oni &ndash; power which escalated as she let the demon even deeper within her, lured on by its promise to grant her a child. The exchange was a dark pact; the ravenous maw splitting the back of her head is both a constant reminder of her own insatiable hunger for the life she lost and the cruel mark of her oni manipulator.<br/><br/>The Ten Thunders have recruited Asami into their number, hoping to use her demonic strength for themselves, but whether they will be able to control her is another matter entirely.<br/><br/>Ten Thunders Box Set, containing six 32mm 'heroic' scale miniatures made of high quality plastic, Stat Cards and Upgrade Cards.

Pick up a card and then play a card, if you have two matching cards then play the two. Once you play a card it is known as a sold card. You collect the sell value and the first player to reach 4,000G's is the winner, simple right? However everything changes because every single turn you also turn over an Action card. This is where the fun really starts! Will it be the cops busting you? A hydroponics upgrade for increased weed sell value, that sees players bidding against each other.

Detailed descriptions of possible activities are included in this document, so as to give the tutors in charge of the game tools to address the needs of their particular group. However, once the participants have become acquainted with the material and the activities available, it is encouraged that they are allowed to choose themselves what tasks to carry out, or even create their own.<br/>Since one of the fundamental pillars of the Langley Math Learning System is self-learning, the teacher or tutor must only act as a facilitator, choosing the most appropriate task considering their skills and needs, explaining it and giving examples if required. The students must be protagonist of their own learning process at all times, and they must have the opportunity to identify their own mistakes and self-correct. To carry out all tasks, this product includes supporting material which must be available should they need them.<br/><br/>This game is part of a group of games created to encourage kids to self-learn mathematics in a didactic way. Unlike other products, the Langley Didactic Material has been designed primarily for teaching purposes, which make sit a fun and captivating tool. It is not a game created to teach math, but a didactic tool that allows for engaging and entertaining learning.<br/><br/>",

        "description": "Death by Cantaloupe<br/>Ideal for 2-4 players.<br/><br/>Goal: Be the first player to reach exactly 100 points using any combination fruits/points<br/><br/>Card Types: (1) PENALTY cards are the Cantaloupe cards and MUST be cleared by penalized player before putting down points towards goal (2) Crazy Coconut cards can wipe out penalty cards immediately (3) Fruit cards each have point values of 5, 10, and 15 and are used to reach the 100-point goal or clear a penalty card<br/>To Start: Shuffle all cards.  Deal each player 6 cards and put the remaining cards face down in a draw pile. EACH PLAYER WILL ALWAYS KEEP 6 CARDS IN THEIR HAND.<br/><br/>Game Play: Player 1 draws a card and makes a decision to either (1) put down a point card face up to add towards the 100-point goal OR (2) put down a PENALTY Death by Cantaloupe card on another player OR (3) discard and play nothing. Player 1 will still have 6 cards in hand when turn is over and it is the next player&rsquo;s turn to draw a card and play.  At the end of each turn, the player will always have 6 cards in their hand.  The first player to have EXACTLY 100-points face up in front of them wins.  If the draw pile runs out, shuffle the discard pile and turn over to start a new draw pile.<br/><br/>Exception to Drawing a Card: If a player has a PENALTY Death by Cantaloupe card played on them, the combination of fruit cards MUST be placed down (one turn at a time) to clear the penalty.  The fruit combination can be from the player&rsquo;s hand of cards or from their existing points pile (therefore reducing their point total).  IF A FRUIT CARD IS MOVED FROM THE FACE UP POINT TOTAL IN FRONT OF A PLAYER, THEY DO NOT DRAW A CARD AND THEIR TURN IS OVER.  The player still has 6 cards in their hand.<br/>Death by Cantaloupe PENALTY: There are 6 penalty cards that have 2-fruit combinations and 6 penalty cards that have 3-fruit combinations.  Penalty cards must be face up with each card that clears it next to it.  When the penalty is cleared all cards go into the discard pile.  Only 1 card per turn can be played and NO point cards toward the 100-point goal can be played by the penalized player until the penalty is cleared.<br/>Crazy Coconut: The Crazy Coconut instantly wipes out a penalty cantaloupe card.  The Death by Cantaloupe card and the Crazy Coconut cards (and any point cards already put down towards the penalty) go into the discard pile.  The player will still have 6 cards in their hand when turn is over.<br/><br/>",

But will it be enough to save Neo Tokyo from the giant Monsters?<br/><br/>In this cooperative board game for up to five players, you build a Mech out of unique parts to create a deadly combat machine! Then take the controls and head into Neo Tokyo to battle Giant Monsters &ndash; but watch out for the citizens caught in the crossfire.<br/><br/>Featuring five-player cooperative battles, you and your friends will work to create the most effective Mechs you can from the parts you have on hand, then defend Neo Tokyo from the gigantic horrors that attack it. If you can work together with your teammates, choose the best strategy, and effectively manage your Mech&rsquo;s power supply and repairs, Neo Tokyo may just survive. If you can&rsquo;t, then it&rsquo;s Game Over, man.<br/><br/>---------Game Overview-----------<br/>Players build their Mechs using the three types of parts (Chassis, Arms, Legs).  Each part has a Tile and a set of cards associated with it. The tiles are combined to form the Mech while the cards are assembled to form the player's Command Deck.<br/>Several Monsters are then placed onto the board which represents the city of Neo Tokyo. Citizen cards are also added to the city, and represent the people in Neo Tokyo that the players must defend.<br/>The Monsters then attack, using an Event Deck which indicates which of the two attacked printed on the Monster Stat cards the Monster will resolve. If the Monster in alone in its City Space, it generally attacks the Citizens and the City itself. If there is a Mech in the space with it, a Monster will attack the Mech instead. This is important because when the Monsters destroy a City space or enough Citizens, the destruction track is raised. If the Destruction Track reaches the final space, the players lose the game!<br/>After the Monsters attack, the players will then use their Command Cards or Tile Actions to engage the Monsters, usually generating a random amount of damage that is applied to the Monster.  Each attack raises a Monster Attack Track, which triggers another Monster Attack Phase when filled. <br/>Once the Monsters are all defeated, the Boss Monster appears. This is a bigger and tougher Monster that the players must defeat in order to win.  <br/>If they can do this before the Destruction Track is filled, they successfully Defend Neo Tokyo<br/><br/>",

Attacks include shoving, which moves the target a number of spaces, as well as melee and ranged attacks.

        "description": "ULTRA is a 2-6 player dice and cards game in which players compete to be the last standing robot in the arena. The game is composed by 3 stages in which you have to build your very own robot, build the arena and filled with traps and last but not least....fight!<br/><br/>On your turn, you have to choose at least one of three available actions: move, attack or push your enemy against walls and traps to deal damages!<br/><br/>The game takes from 30 to 40 minutes per game, with simple and easy to learn rules. ULTRA is a fast-paced game and was designed primarily as a party game that can be enjoyed both from non-boardgames players and hardcore players (we all need a party game in our library!).<br/><br/>ULTRA can be played as a single match or, if you have multiple players, tournaments can be arranged!<br/><br/>Unlike others Robot/Wargaming boardgames ULTRA has unique features that you won't see in other boardgames.<br/><br/>We made up a tailored draft mode that allows you to build your robot relying not only in lucky but also in strategy.<br/><br/>You have to build your own Arena and fill it with different traps, each game won't be the same!<br/><br/>Dead players can still play! As a dead player you can perform one out of three actions to change the course of the game!<br/><br/>As mentioned before, after building you robot through the draft, you have to build the arena by just placing the tiles on table following just one simple rule: each tile has to be connected with at least two squares. Then traps will be randomly picked up and placed by each player wherever they want. Now it's time for players to put the robots into the arena and that's it! You're ready to fight!!<br/><br/>During your turn you have to perform at least 1 action from 3 available: <br/><br/>     Attack: Use your main weapon to deal damage to the enemies by rolling dice <br/>     Move: Use your movement points to move around the arena <br/>     Push: Use your movement points to push enemies against walls or move them into traps. If you kill an enemy you will receive 1 Gear Point but, if you have all your Gear Points, you won't over-exceed them. <br/><br/><br/>You're dead? Don't leave! Because you can still have a role in the game! As a &quot;dead player&quot; you have to perform 1 action between moving a trap to a free square in the arena or swapping a trap in the arena with another one not in the arena. Revenge time!<br/><br/>Easy, simple and funny! That's it!<br/><br/>&mdash;description from the designer<br/><br/>",

        "description": "In Swip Swap Heroes: The King of Baffleburgh has gone to the beach for a Holiday, but the tide has taken him by surprise, and he is now stranded on a tiny island, he even lost one of his slippers to the tide! Luckily for him that he brought his distress beacon. Beep.. Beep.. The Beacon&rsquo;s signal went wide and far, and even a spaceship way out there received the emergency call. Now Heroes from all parts of the world are heading to the signal to be the first to escort the King out of the dreadful waters. Swip Swap Heroes: is a casual Tile based board building game, where the aim of the game is, to be the Hero that leads the lost King, back to safety. It might sound easy enough, but you will have to battle Trambambolins, Selfie Sticks, Monsters, other Heroes and much more in order to accomplish glory and fame in the kingdom of Baffleburgh.<br/> In the Tile-laying game Swip Swap Heroes: There are monsters, utility and mechanical tiles to build with, and four Teams to choose from: the Space Monkeys from outer space, The deep diver Nemo and his Octopus, The Pirate Sisters and the Nerdy Adventureres, they all bring a set of unique Tiles to the game. Each player controls a Team of two Heroes. These Teams compete against each other by setting traps, pushing each other over the edge and manipulate the sea by placing Tiles.<br/> In Swip Swap Heroes: your goal is to be the first Hero that brings the King back to safety, by getting to him, and carrying him back to your Team Island, or by holding the King when the enough Sand Tiles have been placed. The King starts in the center of the board (5x5 Tile Layout), and the four Team Islands are placed in each corner.<br/> Each player has 3 dice in their own color, which are used to determine who goes first, and for resolving battles. In Swip Swap Heroes:, each game starts with building the Sea, 20 of the 70 adventure Tiles are evenly handed out between each player. The first player starts by placing the first Tile face down, then the player to his left places a Tile, and so on. When all twenty Tiles are laid down, the race against the tide begins. You have to remember where you placed the helpful Tiles that you have planned to move on and evade your own traps!<br/> On your turn, you have two Heroes that you can act with, each of them can choose between two actions: move or build. When moving on a Tile, it is revealed and resolved. Entering traps or getting pushed over the edge by another player sends your Hero back to your Team Island, where your Hero will be ready again on your next turn. When encountering another Hero, a battle begins, each Hero rolls their dice against each other, the one with the greatest outcome wins, and the opponent falls into the Sea. When you win a battle against another Hero or monster, you earn Fame, Fame are one time use dice that you can collect and choose to use in need. Mechanical Tiles can help you move quickly into the center and the more the board is getting reveal the more strategic it becomes, should you move or build on top of your opponents path and send him into a trap or maybe you should let him get the King and then push him into the Sea?<br/><br/>The tide rises every time a Sand Tile is placed on top of certain used Tiles such as a Treasure Tile, When the last Sand Tile is placed in the sea the tide has fully risen and the Hero carrying the King at the end of that turn wins the game. Swip Swap Heroes: is a game that you grow into, the more you play, the more familiar you become with the Tiles and their combinations, it is a ever changing Sea, with new strategies and challenges in every game, enjoy and have fun.<br/><br/>Description from the publisher<br/><br/>",

Their pride in life cursed them to exist after death as demons, bound to protect the forests and mountains they once claimed to own. Hybrids of man and bird, the Tengu are incredibly swift, aggressive, and very territorial. More than one man has fallen victim to their razor talons for daring to despoil the Tengu's hunting grounds with mining, logging, or simply existing where one should not be. The sight of a Tengu is seen as presaging rebellion and war, the earth itself rising up against the enemy.<br/><br/>Despite their fearsome appearance and reputation, the Tengu are not entirely hostile. There are even rumors that they help train the Torakage, explaining the latter's swiftness and stealth. The villages that lie within a Tengu's domain have long since learned to treat the land with respect, and tradition dictates a gift is left for the Tengu at the changing of each season. In return, these people know they will be watched over as carefully as the land itself.<br/><br/>Ten Thunders Box Set, containing three 32mm 'heroic' scale miniatures made of high quality plastic.

He could captivate his audiences with a voice that boomed louder than thunder or movements that whirled more gracefully than a swirling stream. His performance was so perfect that it was almost divine... inhuman, even.<br/><br/>One night after a particularly mesmerizing show, the audience begged him to take off his mask so they could see the true face of the man underneath. Yasunori complied, but the crowd could not accept the truth behind the demonic visage of the Oni staring back at them. They turned on the actor they had cheered but a moment earlier, chasing him into the forest with drawn weapons and powerful curses.<br/><br/>Memories of that painful night still haunt Yasunori, and his own shame burns inside him hotter than molten iron. Riding upon his fearsome longma, a winged steed he tricked into serving as his mount, the Oni now wreaks vengeance upon those whom he had once dedicated his whole life to pleasing.<br/><br/>Ten Thunders Box Set, containing one 32mm 'heroic' scale miniatures made of high quality plastic.<br/><br/>Set Contains:<br/><br/>Models<br/><br/>Yasunori<br/><br/>Stat Cards<br/><br/>Yasunori<br/><br/>",

They tend to know a handful of magical tricks of debatable usefulness, such as the ability to immediately switch location with a nearby teapot (and only a teapot).<br/><br/>Tanuki have an intense (some would say unreasonable) love of alcohol, but they are too impatient to brew it themselves. They usually attempt to steal their booze from unaware, but if pressed, they can easily conjure up a magical (though, tragically, non-alcoholic) elixir that is highly sought after by non-Tanuki.<br/><br/>It was this love of alcohol that led to Tanuki first arriving in Malifaux: a group of them had hidden within a shipment of sake the Ten Thunders were shipping through the Second breach. When the crate was opened, the drunken Tanuki scattered.<br/><br/>After initially considering Tanuki to be nothing more than pests, the Brewmaster reluctantly established a relationship with the little creatures.

A roll of 3 will automatically dismiss the batsman as bowled. Other numbers show the player has hit the ball to various parts of the playing field. A second roll of the die is then required to move the struck ball to its field location. This may result in a score (as runs) or dismissal in various ways (caught, run out, stumped or L.B.W).<br/><br/>The batting team continues to amass a score until all 10 wickets have fallen. This is their final score which then the other player must try to surpass to win the game<br/><br/>The game board appears to be have been slightly modified over time with at least 3 versions showing minor changes is the players outfit, their fielding positions and postures, the title and the grandstand in the background. The national logo was also absent in the later versions, with just Made in Australia printed on the board<br/><br/>Originally copyrighted 1913.

        "description": "This game depicts a battle between the Hanseatic League Fleet and the Pirates of &quot;Victual Brothers&quot; around the island of Heligoland.<br/><br/>The game has 24 units comprising two fleets with the same mix of units in both fleets. The fleets are differentiated by the color of their hulls and different Flagships.  The ships are of different sizes represented by the number of their masts.<br/><br/>A ship can take (destroy) an enemy ship of the same or smaller size and can move a number of points on the map based on its size (big ships move less than the smaller ones).  If a ship has other ships on points surrounding it, it is considered protected and cannot be taken.<br/><br/>The units are flats and appear to be hand painted.  The Flagship of the Hanseatic league is the &quot;Colorful Cow&quot; and the pirate's Flagship is called the &quot;Sea Wolf&quot;. Both Flagships move and attack with a range of 1 but can take out all ships including each other. Victory is determined in multiple ways related to which ships have been lost.<br/><br/>A truly amazing game from the late 1930s.<br/><br/><br/>",

There is also a deck of Salem cards that are drawn when a player lands on a cat token. These cards have actions that can be good or bad.<br/><br/>Winner is the first player to collect 8 tokens, 2 from each realm, finishing on the Other realm in the centre of the board.<br/><br/>",

On the map grid there are octopus squares that the players must avoid while trying to reach the Aleutian Islands where they can collect different types of cargo. The player then has to return the cargo to their home port to earn points depending on the type of cargo. The Nautilus is also moving around the board based on instructions spoken by Captain Nemo on the cassette. If this lands on or passes over a players ship, that ship has to return to the home port.<br/><br/>The winner is the player to accumulate the highest cargo value when the cassette ends.<br/><br/>",

You get the Wiener! Guys who like your character's Traits have easier rolls for you, so peek and pick carefully!<br/><br/>The game is over when there are no Wieners left to grab.

Will it be a cake, or a puppy, or a steel mantrap? Parcels are grasped, to and fro, as the vile family members vie for whatever feels like the best present. Will you get what you want? And why does this really heavy, round one smell of burning?<br/><br/>In each round of the game you'll take the role of the various eccentric and unpleasant family members. You'll score points if you end up with the gifts you wanted. But look out! Some of these presents are gigantic bombs!

If a player starts their turn with all of their cards face-up, then the round is over and we see who has gained the best gifts to determine a winner for that round.

It can be played in four ways: Match Play (single pack), Tournament Play (multiple packs), Power Play (head-to-head), or Single Play (solitaire). All versions use a Master Deck of 60 original cards.<br/><br/>There are four kinds of cards: Character Cards, Power Cards, Special Ability Cards, and Opportunity Cards. Booster Cards are also available. The object of the game is to defeat all your opponent's Character Cards by gaining powers and special abilities. Two players challenge each other to a duel with dice until no challengers are left standing.<br/><br/>The object of the game is to clear your opponent&rsquo;s battlefield of all Character Cards. A battlefield consists of one Leader and up to three Guards. When a player&rsquo;s Character Cards on the battlefield have been eliminated, that player is out of the game. The last remaining player is the winner.<br/><br/>Play begins by shuffling the cards of the Master Deck. Deal four cards. Arrange these cards on the table so that there is one in front of three cards. Next, deal four cards to each player. The remaining cards become the Draw Pile. If the Draw Pile is empty, shuffle the Discard pile and create a new Draw pile. Turns the four cards on the table face up.<br/><br/>On each turn, do one of the following options: place a Character Card on the board, draw a card from the Draw Pile, add a Power Card to any Character Card, add a Special Ability to any Character Card, play an Opportunity Card, initiate a Challenge, or pass.<br/><br/>With the use of dice, players challenge each other to battles. A player is eliminated if all their Character Cards have been defeated. The last remaining player is the winner of the game.<br/><br/>",

Your team is also equipped with 2 towers and a base. These structures have a health system that is easy to keep track of with a counting system built in.<br/><br/>Your goal is to destroy your opponent's base while protecting your own. Any time you defeat enemy Heroes you earn specialty cards that can assist you to victory. These cards include damage boosters for single attacks, respawn delays to assign to your opponent's hero, and much more.<br/><br/>Battling structures is simple, choose your Hero, flip upside down and spin the spinner. Reference your Hero Cards to add a value or action to your spin's outcome. If it's an attack, subtract that amount to the structure's health. Deplete all health on a tower and it is removed from play giving you a clear path to the base. When attacking an enemy Hero, flip both Heroes over and spin. Higher number wins without elemental influence.<br/><br/>Strategically maneuver your way into your opponent's base area and destroy their base. Upon doing so, claim the title of the ATK! Champion.

The game is played on two maps of Petrograd showing historically precise locations of stationed regiments, officer schools, bridges, important buildings and the Winter Palace itself. The player will take control of soldiers, Baltic Fleet sailors and Red Guards attempting to overcome the government forces consisting of Junkers, cossacks and Shock infantry.<br/><br/>Over the course of the game, the player prepares the coup organizing Red Guards, agitates garrisoned regiments, gathers revolutionary forces to prevent the government from bringing more troops into Petrograd and arresting the player. The revolutionary patrols seize crucial points in Petrograd, like train stations, communication centres and power plants, facing opposition from the government that tries to uphold the control of the city. The conflict escalates with the revolutionary forces encircling the Winter Palace and finally assaulting and seizing it during the dark October night. <br/>The game includes 58 historical events, played in variable chronology, and with 60 minutes of playtime offers excellent replayability. Will the Provisional Government be able to retain the control of Petrograd or will the shot from Aurora usher in a new era in the history of Russia?<br/><br/>",

Business is booming, and you need to get rid of the inconvenient competition.<br/><br/>--<br/><br/>Debris is a fast-paced, crafting &amp; brawling card game for 2 players.<br/><br/>Each player starts with a companion and a handful of debris cards. Each turn, players use debris for building,trading, and assigning tasks to their roster of bots.<br/><br/>Through the Maintenance &amp; Business phases of a turn, players use cards from their hand to acquire packaged bots from the Market, build them, deceive their opponent, and stay alive. Once built, bots are used to draw more cards and get an edge on the competition. They have perks and defects that will affect their efficiency, as well as how they interact with the other components in play.<br/><br/>Each model of bot comes in different versions, ranging from questionably operational to unexpectedly potent. Packaged bots are only revealed once built, so it&rsquo;s up to players to make the best from their luck and memory.<br/><br/>The goal of each player is to seize all of his opponent&rsquo;s cards, emptying his hand. A player wins the game when his opponent doesn&rsquo;t have any cards in his hand at the end of a turn.<br/><br/>&mdash;description from the designer<br/><br/>",

        "description": "This hidden set-up war game is an unusual WWII adaptation of the classic L'Attaque. What makes it most unusual is that the rules are dated 11/44, which means it must have been one of the first French games published after the liberation.<br/><br/>This is a more complex game than L'Attaque or its successor Stratego. Its name translates as &quot;The Lightning War&quot; (or Blitzkrieg), and this is reflected in the mix of pieces.<br/><br/>Whereas L'Attaque and its successor Stratego simply used numerically ranked pieces, this game includes a host of WWII-era innovations as well, with pieces representing parachutists, bombers, anti-aircraft guns, delayed-action bombs, flying bombs and a tanker-truck that must survive to keep the bombers flying. Missing from the mix is any kind of armored unit, but there are &quot;magnetic fences&quot; that somehow disable the engines of aeroplanes.<br/><br/>Movement and combat is much more flexible than in the basic L'Attaque. Pieces may move in any direction, including diagonally, and may attack any piece orthogonally adjacent. To win, players must capture both the opponent's flag and its &quot;secret plan&quot;.<br/><br/>",

A grammatically correct sentence, no matter if it makes sense or not, can be used against an opponent to shame him publically, giving him penalty points. Some races are offended and thus humilated more by specific words than others. Once a player has accumulated 30 points or more through insults of the other players, he is eliminated from the game, though there are a couple of proposed house rule which allow for different ways to play this game.<br/><br/>",

        "description": "Fours is a modern interpretation of the ancient Sumerian game The Royal Game of Ur.  While inspired by that game, the rules have been simplified allowing for an easy-to-learn game that still has elements of chance with a need for strategy.<br/><br/>Like the original game, Fours is a race to move checkers through a course.  Opponents can knock each other off the course, but there are 'safe' spaces.  The 'fours' theme is evident throughout the game - dice yield a result of 1, 2, 3, or 4.  Safe spaces occur every 4 spaces. Each player has four checkers to run through the course.  A roll of 4 allows a player an extra roll.<br/><br/>One of the most unique design elements of the game is the portability.  The game 'board' is actually a fabric game mat with a rubberized backing.  This allows it to conveniently fold and pack into a small pouch easily carried in a purse, backpack, or briefcase.  Unlike modern recreations of the game, a large, bulky wooden board is not required.<br/><br/>",

Each player represents a ruthless investor in the megacity Dystopolis. The aim is to outmanoeuvre  the rivals through clever investments and by maximizing the profit from companies. Money can also be used to shamelessly bribe others into obedience. Action cards can be used to remove competing investments or to take over threatening companies - as long as the voting succeeds.<br/><br/>The game mechanics is a combination of area control, stock holding and economic negotiation through bribes and bidding. The strategy in Dystopolis is centered around the placement of company tiles and investment tokens. The players add company tiles to the modular game board during each round. To claim ownership the players then need to invest money in the companies. The companies establish connections to each other. More connections to other companies increases the revenue, but also makes the company more vulnerable to attacks. A player with limited influence in an area can compensate for this by saving pleny of money for bribes.<br/><br/>&mdash;description from the publisher<br/><br/>",

        "description": "Overview from Walifaux wiki<br/><br/>Hans is a Sniper for a hire, a Mercenary who will work for anyone willing to pay his fees.<br/><br/>Mobility<br/><br/>Lawls no.<br/><br/>Hans as a Walk of 3 and is completely unable to declare a charge. Deploy him in a good position, because he's unlikely to move very far from that spot over the course of a game.<br/><br/>Offense<br/><br/>Hans has a Sniper Rifle with a respectable Sh of 6, a decent damage spread of 2/3/5, and an insane range of 18 inches. When he focuses, the range of his Sniper Rifle increases to 36 inches(!), allowing him to reach out and touch someone almost across the entire board. Furthermore, due to his excellent sniping skills, Hans does not randomize when shooting into melee. Pinpoint precision is a virtue.<br/><br/>He also comes equipped with Goggles, which allow him to ignore any pulse, aura, or Markers which affect Line of Sight. This won't always come up during a game, but it can be a surprise for opponents who think that their models are safe within a cloud of steam or behind a pillar of ice. Hans is also Ruthless, so he is immune to Willpower duels (such as those created by the Terrifying or Manipulative abilities) during his turn.<br/><br/>His Sniper Rifle comes with an assortment of triggers, one for each suit. He can use his Reference the Field Guide tactical action each turn to discard a card, which adds the suit of the discarded card to his duel totals for the rest of his activation. This is a good use for low cards in your hand, ensuring that Hans will hit the triggers you need regardless of the suits of his flipped or cheated cards.<br/><br/>The Kneecap trigger lets Hans discard a card to give the target Slow, the Armor Piercing trigger makes his attack ignore Armor, the Curse Breaker trigger makes his attack ignore Incorporeal, and the Disarm trigger lets Hans discard a card to give a Minion the Disarmed Condition, which prevents them from making Ml actions until the end of the turn.<br/><br/>Hans also possesses the Smile, You Son of a... tactical action, which grants him the Ping! Condition for the rest of his activation. Ping! changes Hans's attacks so that they deal no damage, but instead discard one Upgrade from his target. This very unique ability makes Hans the one model that can knock upgrades off of other models, which can drastically change the course of a game, especially when used against Masters.<br/><br/>However, Hans is also a mercenary in the truest sense of the word, and his To the Highest Bidder ability allows any Master that has been targeted by Hans to discard two cards to make the action immediately fail. Be wary about this, though sometimes forcing the opponent to discard can be useful in its own right.<br/><br/>Resilience<br/><br/>Hans has a high Defense and an average Willpower, though his main defense is that he's a sniper who probably won't move very far from where you deploy him at the start of the game. If the opponent does get close, however, he is also Disguised, making him immune to charges.<br/><br/>Otherwise, he has a low number of wounds for a model of his price, so try to pick a good spot with plenty of firing lanes and some good cover when you deploy him.<br/><br/>Upgrades<br/><br/>As of Ripples of Fate, Hans has his own 0 Soulstone Upgrade, Advanced Sight. This boosts his Wk to 4, and gives him the (0) Advanced Sight Action. It gives Hans Focused +1, but needs a 7 of any suit to succeed. It also competes with Reference The Field Guide for his (0) action.<br/><br/>Oathkeeper is great for Hans in Outcasts, as a turn of Fast is three attacks per turn, or two attacks after a successful Smile, You Son of a... action. That's a potential two upgrades he can shoot off of an enemy model, which is usually a pretty good exchange for your own discarded Oathkeeper.<br/><br/>Scramble is another option for Hans, but given his already slow speed, it's not a good one, as he'll still be slow, only more expensive. If you want a fast model, take something other than Hans.<br/><br/>When working for the Guild, Plant Evidence can be useful for allowing Hans to help out with Power Ritual, if you deploy him near one of your corners. This also has the effect of keeping Power Ritual a secret until later in the game, as you won't be dropping a scheme marker in your own corner at the start of the game and giving it away.<br/><br/>Imbued Energies is useful out of Arcanists, for the same reason that Oathkeeper is good in Outcasts. A Fast Hans is a happy Hans.<br/><br/>Out of Neverborn, Pact can use useful on Hans to ensure that his attacks won't be completely shut down by the Black Joker.<br/><br/>Ten Thunders can give him Recalled Training, which makes Hans very effective for one turn. The +flip to all his actions can help with both Smile, You Son of a... and his Sniper Rifle attacks, making him more accurate when it counts.<br/><br/>Tactics and Tips<br/><br/>The effectiveness of Hans really depends on his board and your deployment zone, as he's great on boards where he can get to a high position and cover wide swathes of the board, but less effective if most of the board is blocked off from his bullets.<br/><br/>Smile, You Son of a... is a scary ability that will cause many opponents to panic, as nobody wants to see the upgrades shot off their Masters. You can use this to your advantage and bluff with Hans to make them discard via his To the Highest Bidder ability, as the opponent has to choose whether or not to discard before you flip any cards for Hans's attack.<br/><br/>Tara has a cute trick that she can do with Hans and Whispers From Darkness (Eternal Journey upgrade). By burying Hans (via a Glimpse the Void trigger from her crew), she can use Whispers From Darkness to use his Smile, You Son of a... action and gain the Ping! Condition. This allows Tara to shoot upgrades off of other models without having to worry about Hans's To the Highest Bidder ability allowing the opponent to cancel her attacks. Her ability to bury him also allows him to rapidly deploy on the battlefield, either via her Faces in the Void action (Obliteration Symbiote upgrade) or just as a natural result of the Glimpse the Void trigger. The latter option, however, tends to bring him closer to the action than he prefers.<br/><br/>Lilith can also help Hans rapidly redeploy via her Tangle Shadows action, which can toss him forward in exchange for tossing one of her (much faster) models back to his prior location. When used in conjunction with sprinting Terror Tots, this enables Hans to get to an advantageous position without having to make what might otherwise be a game-long trudge with his slow speed.<br/><br/>Mah Tucket can also push Hans around with her Horribly Hollerin' action, ensuring that he gets to a better position for his shooting without having to take a Walk action.<br/><br/>Playing Against Hans<br/><br/>He's a sniper, so your best bet is probably to either avoid getting into his line of fire, or close to melee and kill him there.<br/><br/>Be careful of his Smile, You Son of a... action, as it can knock the upgrades off your Master and Henchmen, and save cards to discard to cancel Han's attack if you have upgrades that you simply cannot live without.<br/><br/>",

        "description": "In The Ancient Evil up to 4 players will take on the role of investigators trying to thwart the plans of the evil cults, <br/>controlled by a fifth.  This fifth evil player or 'Games Master' will be in charge of driving the scenario, creating an atmosphere of mystery and suspense for investigators. The 'Games Master' will find everything they need to keep the investigators on edge; summoning cultists and monsters, as well as introducing plot twists, special events, and more. And the closer the investigators get the more powerful he will become.<br/><br/>During each scenario the investigators are free to proceed as they wish but every action they take in their attempts to solve the mystery generates 'menace' which in turn fuels the powers of the 'Game Master'.<br/><br/>Both investigators and enemies use a points system to perform different actions. Some actions, such as moving and attacking are limited in how many times they can be performed on a turn.<br/>Actions are resolved using a D10 dice, rolled against the relevant skill, to determine success ranging from critical failure to a critical success. Critical results will be unique to the item or action being used/taken.  Some enemies can even take and use items and equipment against the investigators.<br/><br/>Facing off against the Ancient Evil the investigators are in constant danger of falling to insanity. Exposure to otherworldly creatures, eldritch magic and unnatural events all threaten to drain their precious sanity.  Such mental trauma can result in <br/>episodes of temporary insanity or phobias which impact on an investigators ability to perform actions.  Investigators pushed to the brink may even become completely insane.  But this does not eliminate the investigator who, after flipping their character sheets to reveal an insane version, will continue to play.<br/><br/>The game comes with a scenario book containing numerous missions that can be played alone or linked as a campaign.  But it doesn't end there.  With the many tiles, enemies and other components you will have the tools to create your own scenarios.  We are also committed to supporting the game and keeping to alive by, amongst other things, providing even more scenarios via our website which will be free to download.<br/><br/>&mdash;description from the designers<br/><br/>",

Next control the Supreme Court (Judicial). Then control the Presidency (Executive).<br/><br/>Roll and move to collect (purchase) States which increase the number of votes you receive towards the 280 required to win the game. When you control all the States of a Territory, you can start to add Support which will increase the income level for any State in that Territory.<br/><br/>Control the Supreme Court by appointing 5 of the 9 Supreme Court Justices. Appointment is scaled with the first requiring 50 votes and $500K, the 2nd 100 votes, 3rd 150 votes, 4th 200 votes and the 5th and final 250 or more votes. $500k must be paid in each case. Justices can be removed if your vote total drops below the required amount.<br/><br/>Controlling the Presidency requires 280 votes, 5 Justices and pay  Five Million dollars to the bank. This is how you win the game.<br/><br/>",

        "description": "Technically The Glory of Rome is the title of a &quot;Series of Historical-Political-Military Conflict-Simulations about the Ancient World&quot; (to quote the cover), and this is volume one, The Complete Approach to the Wars between the CARTHAGE and ROME of Scipio Africanus and Hannibal, but since no other volumes were published the series title is being used for the game.<br/><br/>The game is strategic, with a fairly small map covering the Western Mediterranean. There are 65 turns covering the entire period of the Punic Wars; players are not necessarily fighting the entire time as wars need to be declared and peace can be brokered by agreement. In between wars players can move troops around, get reinforcements, hire mercenaries, etc.<br/><br/>Land units are represented by a small set of metal miniatures (included with the game); army strengths are presumably recorded on paper although this is not made very clear. Naval units are represented either by paper counters cut from a possibly-included sheet or by borrowed counters. Historical leaders with special abilities enter and leave the game on a schedule.<br/><br/>Combat uses a fairly standard CRT but with die roll adjustments provided by players simultaneously choosing maneuvers which are cross-referenced on a separate table.<br/><br/>In addition to the leaders chrome is provided in the form of special rules for various locations, e.g. Sardinia has a chance of revolting starting on turn 16 unless it has a sufficiently large garrison.<br/><br/>Much about the game is unclear since Taurus Games' rules were written in a barely coherent stream-of-consciousness style.<br/><br/>&mdash;user summary<br/><br/>",

Gandouchi is a traditional event that takes place during the Doll Festival particularly in the prefecture of Gifu. Children visit nearby houses and ask to view that home's doll display. After viewing the dolls, they receive snacks and sweets from the residents of the home &mdash; comparable to the tradition of Trick-or-treating on Halloween in some Western countries.<br/><br/>In Gandouchi, you want to arrange hina doll cards in your hand the best way possible. All the cards start spread out face down on the table. On a turn, you reveal two cards, then add one of them to your hand or exchange a card in hand for one of these cards. Any exchanged card and the card not taken are turned face down again, so pay attention to these cards and watch what others pick up!<br/><br/>At game's end, players reveal their hands, scoring the most points for having a wide range of colors and types of cards.<br/><br/>",

The first player to get a combination of jobs that pays $3,000 per month, without exceeding 200 working hours, is the winner.<br/><br/>Game play: On a player's turn they roll the dice and move the appropriate number of spots around the board. The player then picks up the job card corresponding to the spot they landed on, and place the card in front of them. The player then records the amount of hours worked, and earns the income from the job. It is then the next player's turn. This repeats until one player has accumulated enough jobs to earn $3,000 per month, without exceeding 200 working hours.<br/><br/>If a player gets a new job card that would put them over 200 hours worked, they need to either discard the card, or replace one of their other job cards with the new card.<br/><br/>On their turn, after rolling their dice but before moving, a player can try to gamble to try and steal someone else's job. If the player decides to gamble, they re-roll the dice and attempt to get the same result. For example, if the die roll of the their first roll was 8, then they would try to re-roll the dice to get 8 again. If they are successful, they can take any job card from any other player. If they are not successful, then they must pay a penalty fee to the &quot;Employment Pot&quot;.<br/><br/>The rules suggest that any penalty paid to the &quot;Employment Pot&quot; should be paid with real money, and the winner of the game gets to keep any money in the &quot;Employment Pot.&quot;<br/><br/>&mdash;user summary<br/><br/>",

(Because you can never have enough of bizarre.)<br/><br/>If you are not afraid of monsters, U.F.O.s or anything supernatural, the kids could really use your help. Save them from disasters and look out for enemies while constantly making sure you have enough cards to survive another turn.<br/><br/>So, in conclusion, Monsters and Kids is a turn by turn strategic card game created by two architects. The strategies range from developing cute illustrations, attractive intro videos, nursery rhymes, dark themes, self-referential humor to deadly aggressive attacks for pulling in maximum people.<br/><br/>&mdash;description from the designer<br/><br/>",

        "description": "Newsroom is a worker placement game where you get to manage your own international media outlet. The aim of the game is to publish your newspaper editions earlier than other players thus gaining the trust of your audience and of the advertisers and boosting your global presence as an International media outlet.<br/><br/>In the beginning of the round, news come out in different countries around the world in different fields (politics, economy, sports, culture). Each story is associated to countries with the roll of dice. Players have in their disposal a Press team and send its members to cover some of the stories, by interviewing people and getting their news copy back in the paper. <br/> Each edition is divided in 4 blocks (newspaper columns) and has to cover at least 10 content points which derive from the news pieces that journalists bring back or, later in the game, from advertisements. Once the edition content is complete, the paper goes to the editors while journalists are free to get some more news stories from around the world.<br/><br/>After the editors have checked your story, the copy moves on to printing and is published. Its time to collect money, to pay your Press team and to hire better journalists, or more editors or printers to get your next edition even faster. Remember, the competition in the media is fierce and if you lose time the other media outlets will get your story out and it will then be worth nothing to you or your audience.<br/><br/>Based in the queuing theory, Newsroom is an easy to learn but hard to master worker placement- economic management game where speed and effectiveness determine the winner. Much like in the real media world!<br/><br/>&mdash;description from the designer<br/><br/>",

Whales are trying to safely travel north to the feeding grounds to feast on rich krill while being pursued by a sharp lookout in the crow's nest of a whaling ship. On each expedition, use your senses to track down a whale in the vast ocean. But be careful of dangerous weather, unexpected repairs, or even a nasty tail fluke that can bring your chase quickly to an end.<br/><br/>One player plays as the Whale and the other as the Lookout. The Whale player puts the cards face down in a 4 x 4 grid, and the Lookout chooses cards. Based on the card chosen when revealed, various actions occur that can have the Lookout win, the Whale win, or other results. Play continues until the Whale is found or or the Shipyard is found, or until the expedition ends. Cards include the Whale, a tail attack, crow's nest, open ocean, shipyard, and storm.<br/><br/>&mdash;user summary<br/><br/>",

This game is not a deck builder, so both players will be playing from a pre-set deck. Each player gets a hand of seven cards (with at least one &quot;pusher&quot; card in their hand) before the game starts. You must flip cards to use them, only using specific cards for your turn.<br/><br/>There are a few different card types; Pushers, Henchmen, and Actions. Pushers sell the drugs and can be used once per turn. Once you flip the card over in order to use them you gain money that can only be spent during that turn. Once the turn is over, the money disappears. Pushers cannot attack, defend, or take damage and only one can be used per turn.<br/><br/>Henchman have different costs, abilities, and attributes. They are used to gain power in the town and can be attacked. Henchman also cost a fair amount of money each, so you will need to be able to pay them to use them in your turn. The first turn you draw a henchman, you have to have them flipped, so they cannot be played right away.<br/><br/>Action cards are not flipped but instead discarded. There are only two of each action card in the deck, so you need to play them wisely. Each action is immediate and costs resources to play. These can be used to harm player&rsquo;s henchmen or the player themselves.<br/><br/>Each player has 10 health points (the player themselves who holds the cards) so once they have been harmed enough to reach zero health points, the game is over.<br/><br/>Pusher Kings has some really awesome artwork drawn on the cards! This card game does not have deck building aspects, so it is an easy game to pick up and play with your friends.<br/><br/>&mdash;description from the designer<br/><br/>",

        "description": "Freight Wars is a 2-3 player game where you can procedurally generate your game tiles before you print them, giving you a completely unique game set. You are a Victorian industrialist who is looking to build a transportation network. You can do this by placing roads, rivers, or railways to connect towns to other places, as well as block off the routes of your opponents.<br/><br/>First, you must choose which mode of transportation each player should use. One should use roads, one rivers, the other should use trains. Then, you must shuffle the cards and hand them out to various players. Each player should get a town card, as well as two other cards dealt to them.<br/><br/>Players must place tiles so that the modes of transportation connect to the tiles already placed on the table. These tiles will need to match up for every mode of transportation to be placed, then the player will be able to draw another tile from the deck, so they always have three cards. Players can also skip a turn by discarding all of their tiles to draw a new hand.<br/><br/>After all of the tiles are placed, players must count up how many connections they have between towns. There are different points depending on how well the transport links are between different places. This can be seen in more detail in the rules of the game.<br/>&mdash;description from the designer<br/><br/>This print-and-play game has an unusual distribution method - players download a Windows executable program which generates random tiles for printing.  Once printed, the tiles are used for traditional tabletop play.  Because the tiles are programmatically generated with randomization, no two sets will be exactly the same.<br/><br/>&mdash;user summary<br/><br/>",

Do you push-your-luck and hold out for 'the whole caboodle', or cut your losses and deliver a sub-standard product...?  It's your call, but when the last Wine Collector has left the building, it's game over!<br/><br/>Each round, players take it in turns to either draw a card from one of three decks (either a new one from the top, or the last previously discarded tile) or can choose to satisfy a Wine Collector's demands and 'claim' the relevant Income from that Collector. Collectors will pay well if all their demands are satisfied, or not-so-much if you can only meet some of their expectations...<br/><br/>There are three tile decks:<br/><br/>Grapes are double-sided tiles with a particular grape or wine variety on each side. These are placed in front of players when they're drawn, but each player may only have a maximum of four  grapes/varieties in front of them at any one time, but may choose to draw additional Grape tiles and discard down if necessary to ensure they do not exceed this limit. Grape cards will need to be given up for each Wine Collector claimed.<br/><br/>Flavours are tiles that have two representative flavours on them, and they can be utilised one way or the other by rotating the tile through 180 degrees. These are kept in a player's hand until used to claim a Wine Collector.<br/><br/>Finally, Nuances are tiles that have three descriptors on them, and can be used to satisfy Collector demands either in part or whole, depending on how they are used and which descriptors are covered by other tiles when making a claim. These tiles are also kept in a player's hand until used.<br/><br/>A player's hand size is limited to just six tiles/cards in total (excl. Grapes/Varieties which are kept on the table in front of them), and you must juggle these as best you can to make a call on what tiles are worth holding onto, and which ones can be safely discarded...<br/><br/>&mdash;description from the publisher<br/><br/>",

Players take turns rolling dice and moving around the game board.

Cards present positive situations were points are rewarded for being in a positive circumstance or having a positive attitude. Those points are then multiplied by their corresponding weight (10% or 40% respectively) that the situation has on one&rsquo;s happiness level. Players than move their score tracker the appropriate number of spaces in the scoring area.<br/><br/>The same happens when players land on a negative space, except the points are negative and suggestions are given on what players can do to raise their happiness levels in negative situations.<br/><br/>Some of the cards provide points of discussion such as, &ldquo;You begin volunteering at the local animal shelter.

The tricky part is that too much knowledge may lead them to insanity, reducing their effectiveness for the rest of the game.<br/><br/>Each turn 6 cards are drawn from a deck of artifact cards. Each card represents a type of artifact (book, map, dagger, etc) and has a numerical value between 1 and 6. Players alternate placing their cultists on the cards. They cannot place cultists where they already have a presence, and must outbid by at least one the player with majority on an occupied card.<br/><br/>Once all cultists have been assigned, each card goes to the player with majority. The cards are arranged in sets (books with books, etc), and if the numerical value of a set reaches or exceeds the Insanity Value for that game, a cultist of that player goes insane and is removed from the game. The set that went bust is turned face down.<br/><br/>The game continues until the deck runs out of cards or a player loses 3 cultists. Players score the value of their face up cards.

You conquer a constellation when you get your colored discs on more than have the number of stars in the constellation.<br/><br/>Play takes place on a 34&quot; x 22&quot; mat with images of the constellations.  Players roll dice to move their pieces around the track on the outside.  You either stop on spaces with color\\star combinations that allow you to put a marker on a star or stars in a constellation or you land on spaces that allow you to take a card and follow the instructions on the card.<br/><br/>Two other variations of game play include The Game of Polaris (The North Star) in which players start in a different constellation and move towards Polaris.  Final variations include a Fast Game Variation which allows you to just conquer stars based on dice throw instead of moving around the track on the game mat.<br/><br/>&mdash;user summary<br/><br/>",

Players attempt to match the picture on a card (like a Kangaroo) with a location on the globe (like Australia) as a timer is running. First player to the finish space wins.<br/><br/>Game Two is a race across the board as players attempt to match pictures and locations to a continent card (Asia, Africa, etc.) that was randomly assigned at the beginning of the session.<br/><br/>Game Three adds word cards and requires additional reading skills. This is also a race but it includes a card taking mechanic based on a word search between player's hands.<br/><br/>Designed for 2, 3, or 4 players age 3 or older.<br/><br/>Includes the inflatable globe, a globe stand, tokens, cards, timer, instruction booklet, and board.<br/><br/>",

        "description": "What is Rabbit Trails? Rabbit Trails is card game for all ages (especially students!) involving play with word association.<br/><br/>How do you play it? Play starts with each player being dealt 7 cards. Then the top card of the remaining deck is flipped over. Each player takes turns laying a card this is easily associated with the card showing. For example: The card flipped at the start of the game is, &quot;Rabbit&quot;. Player 1 plays, &quot;Carrot&quot; (because rabbits eat carrots). Player 2 plays, &quot;Chef&quot; (because chefs can cook carrots). Player 3 plays, &quot;Astronaut&quot; (because both chef and astronaut are professions). And player 4 plays, &quot;Grape&quot;. Wait! Grape?? Grape clearly doesn't match with &quot;Astronaut&quot;. The other players hear out Player 4's reasoning and vote on whether or not to allow the card to stay in play. They vote for the card to be removed. Player 4 has to draw a new card as a penalty and play continues. The winner is the first person to get rid of all their cards. If a player cannot play (and does not want to try and fool the others by playing a less than perfect card), the player can draw and, if the card will work, play it right away.<br/><br/>But that's not all! There are also action cards featuring various ways to foil the plans of the other players and get you closer to winning the game.<br/><br/>What are the benefits of Rabbit Trails? Benefit #1, Rabbit Trails is an awesome game. Seriously! I have been designing this game over the past couple of years and have been getting bogged down with requests to make this game available from friends, family, and even people who see us playing it while out around town. After refining the cards and getting the rules nailed down, this game is finally ready for prime time! But that isn't all... Benefit #2, is related to education. It's not often that fun and education go together, but Rabbit Trails bridges that gap. Because the aim of the game is to get players to find connections between words, it makes students use higher order thinking, like analysis and evaluation to be successful, which are at the top of Bloom's taxonomy.Benefit #3 [Bonus], Rabbit Trails is great to test your English language skills if you are currently learning English or use English as a second language. It makes English language learners think critically about words and their multiple meanings!<br/><br/>&mdash;description from the publisher<br/><br/>",

Instead, they were only available in special 20th Anniversary-related items of merchandise, which included Mythical Pok&eacute;mon Collections and Red &amp; Blue Collections. Each Mythical Pok&eacute;mon Collection comes packaged with 2 Generations packs, in addition to a special Full Art promotional card and collector's pin featuring 1 of the 11 Mythical Pok&eacute;mon available as part of the 20th Anniversary distributions during 2016.<br/><br/>The Japanese Starter Pack emulates the original both in terms of design and the random nature of the cards included. While the cards contained in each deck can vary, they are grouped based on evolutionary family and type. The deck can be broken down into two sections, which are packaged separately. The first section will always contain one of two Mega Pok&eacute;mon, either M Venusaur-EX or M Charizard-EX, in addition to a fixed selection of Pok&eacute;mon and Energy cards relative to its type, plus multiples of Trainer cards for a total of 27 cards. The second section contains 3 different groups of Pok&eacute;mon containing an evolutionary family of 1 type, plus 1 other Pok&eacute;mon of the same type, matching Energy cards, and a selection of single Trainer cards for a total of 33 cards. None of the cards available as part of the pack have rarity symbols. A special Blastoise version of the Starter Pack (Japanese: スターターパック カメックスver.) was later made available, initially exclusive to venues hosting the Kamex Mega Battle in Japan during May 2016, followed by a more general release from the Pok&eacute;mon Center Online store in June 2016. This version substitutes the Grass or Fire-type cards available in the first section of the regular version with Water-type cards. These cards appear in the core Generations set, but are classed as secret cards in the Starter Pack. The Starter Pack also comes with an exclusive Chansey coin.<br/><br/>-- user summary obtained from: <a target='_blank' href=\"https://leonhartopedia.fandom.com/wiki/Generations_(TCG\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer noopener\">https://leonhartopedia.fandom.com/wiki/Generations_(TCG</a>)<br/><br/>",

Pimple Spell spaces and Snarf spaces can limit players' movement but can be gotten around with Obsidian tokens and Obsidian Spell Phone tokens, which can reroll dice or use the spell phone instead of rolling.

        "description": "At the beginning of the game, each opponent rolls the general/captain and places him in the captain&rsquo;s area(Three circles). Then place the tie breaker die(clear with a small blue die inside it) in the tiebreaker area(5 circles) To start out each player rolls 2 of their dice and places them in the first row. Then the player can choose to either keep his/her row and try his/her luck or they can lower a die&rsquo;s number by one and roll another die. The objective is to have a higher sum for each row than your opponent. The max capacity for each row is five die. At the end of the turn both players add up the die and the larger number is subtracted from the lower number. Next the Difference is taken away from the losing army. If a tie is to occur then the clear die with a blue die in it is rolled by each player and the sum of the two die is added to each player&rsquo;s side based on the roll. Keep doing this until there is no tie. If you have a one in your row at the end of a turn change the one to a six before you add up. If you end up calculating before changing the one to a six the one stays a one for the remainder of the game. If you lose then you can roll the 20 sided die and re roll the captain. Place the same number of added die to your side of the military and try to beat your opponent.<br/><br/>Things to remember: <br/><br/>     If you roll a one with your general, it stays a one<br/>     Lower each die one at a time<br/>     The game stops after you completely lose all of your die and roll the failure die<br/><br/><br/>&mdash;description from the designer<br/><br/>",

        "description": "Baby is cooperative deduction micro game for two to three players in which one player facilitates the recurring and semi-random needs of the infant whilst the other one (or two) player(s) take on the role of the parents, attempting to decipher and resolve the cause of their child's cries.<br/><br/>The game consists of three micro decks of five cards each. One deck represents a happy baby, another a sad baby, and the middle a neutral baby. A baby status token moves between the decks, indicating the current climate of the infant and also defining from which deck the next card should be drawn. Cards are only seen by the player playing the role of the child, and upon them are depicted up to two different needs of the five in the game: hungry, poopie, sleepy, restless and crying wolf (ie. nothing's really wrong). Depending on the card the player will then place face-down tokens showing the baby is upset but not visibly indicating what the cause is. These needs can be resolved with different parent tokens, such as feeding, diapers, carrying, music and playing. While the need tokens don't come in multiples and therefore can't &quot;double up&quot; on the same time the parents only have a limited number of each of their tokens so they must use them wisely. After each step of the game (child expressing and then parents attempting to solve it) the baby status is always move to indicate the new state of the child. If a card should be drawn from an empty deck, the game has ended and the players all win if the status of the baby is happy.<br/><br/>",

        "description": "The 18th century in Europe saw a massive development in weapons and tactics. The musket was refined into a flintlock, smoothbore with a socket bayonet. Although accuracy was low, which limited effective fire to very short ranges, volume of fire improved considerably and units were capable of firing three and sometimes four rounds a minute. The infantryman was now capable of combining the roles of musketeer and pikeman in one. And to maximise firepower, formations became wider. The aim was to move a formation to within range of the enemy and then overwhelm them with firepower. Only rarely was a bayonet charge needed.<br/><br/>&mdash;description from the rulebook<br/><br/>Units of 3 bases represent an infantry battalion or cavalry squadron. Suggested basing sizes are given for 6, 15, and 25/28mm figures.<br/><br/>Players take turns activating one brigade at a time. Each brigade commander is rated as Poor, Average, or Excellent, which allows the commander to activate 1-3 groups of brigade units. After all brigades have activated, combat occurs.<br/><br/>The game includes army lists for various 18th century wars: Great Norther War, American Indian Wars, War of Spanish Succession, Wars Against the Turks, Jacobite Risings, Seven Years War, American War of Independence, and the French Revolutionary Wars.<br/><br/>",

The game does not specify age ranges or play times, but the process is fairly abstract (not for very young children).<br/><br/>The game takes place over three turns.  During each turn, one player assumes the role of &quot;Eye&quot; and all other players assume the role of &quot;Hand(s)&quot;.  The &quot;Eye&quot; draws a &quot;Constellation&quot; card which becomes the object of the cooperative game; the &quot;Constellation&quot; is not shown to the &quot;Hand(s)&quot;.<br/><br/>Using various hand gestures and playing various &quot;Star&quot; cards, the &quot;Eye&quot; attempts to guide the &quot;Hand(s)&quot; into correctly guessing which &quot;Constellation&quot; card is in play.  The game does not allow verbal or written communication.  Play is entirely cooperative, if abstract, and proceeds until the &quot;Hand(s)&quot; correctly guess the &quot;Constellation&quot;, whereupon play passes to the next player who assumes the role of &quot;Eye&quot;.

Enter a room, battle monsters of all types - skeletons, goblins and bears, oh my! (and dozens more) - and leverage your hero's skills to survive.  Loot your foes and move on to the next room.  If you can make it through seven rooms you're pretty good; if you can make it through ten rooms you can call yourself an epic hero, worthy of bards tales from here until the end of time.  But be warned - sometimes the best laid plans fall apart once you set foot in the dungeon.<br/><br/>The mechanics of the game are easy.  Flip over a room card which gives you bonuses/penalties/adjustments.  Deal out monster cards (the same number as the number of heroes who entered the dungeon).  Order them by their Initiative score.  Then fight.<br/><br/>Fighting is dead simple - if you can do basic math you can play.  Take your hero's attack value, roll a 20-sided die (included) and add them together.  Subtract the monster's defense value and if what's left is more than 10 it's a hit.  Subtract your hero's damage from the monster's hit points (represented by cubes) then move to the next hero or monster in line.  Once you get to the end you start again until either all the heroes or all the monsters are defeated.<br/><br/>But don't let that fool you - this isn't a &quot;beat level 1 monsters, then move to level 2&quot; kind of dungeon.  Sure, you might find a lowly kobold in the first room, but you might also find a brown bear.  Or a zombie.  Or a dragon.  Because let's face it - knowing what you're going to find is just plain boring.  And there's nothing boring when when there's a Battle In: The Dungeon.<br/><br/>",

Zip around the map, fire your bullets and be the last animal standing.<br/><br/>User summary<br/><br/>The game is played on a large grid play surface with boundary edges.  Players alternate turns.  During a player's turn they move their token and may fire a projectile (each projectile is fired in one of eight directions).  After each player moves and fires, all projectiles move one square in the direction of their invariable travel.  Projectiles that move into an occupied square &quot;hit&quot; the object in the square and become expended.  Player tokens that are thus hit incur damage.  Note that projectiles do not &quot;belong&quot; to one player or another, and it is possible for players to &quot;shoot themselves&quot;.<br/><br/>The goal of the game is to remain alive longer than your opponent.  The first player destroyed loses; the other player wins.<br/><br/>Anything that &quot;moves off&quot; the right side of the play surface reappears on the left side of the play surface; anything that &quot;moves off&quot; the top of the play surface reappears on the bottom of the play surface, etc., in a mode common to many old video arcade games.  Thus, as turns progress the grid becomes increasingly encumbered with projectiles (insuring that impacts occur increasingly frequently).<br/><br/>",

Now you take the generals seat and try to do better than the historical outcome.<br/><br/>&mdash;description from the back of the box<br/><br/>Stalingrad is a low priced 2 player strategy board game covering the epic battle between the German and Societ forces in and around the city of Stalingrad during WWII.<br/><br/>On June 22, 1941, Germany and the Axis powers invaded the Soviet Union, quickly advancing deep into Soviet territory. The fighting in 41 culminated in a fierce Soviet counter attack on the outskirts of Moscow, which saved the city. Entering 42 Hitler and his commanders shifted the offensive south towards Stalingrad, breaking through the Soviet lines and threatening to cut off the oil rich Caucuses from the main soviet industrial areas. Stalingrad was the lynch pin to the defense of the Soviet south and the place Stalin had demanded the Russian people make a stand at all costs. The result was the bloodiest battle of WWII.<br/><br/>In Stalingrad the game begins with the German drive on Stalingrad itself. Both players begin the game getting a fixed assortment of troop reinforcements, which later shifts to troop purchases as decided by the players. The battle consists of fighting up to and around Stalingrad and includes the northern Caucasus region, plus fighting inside the city itself on the more detailed city map.<br/><br/>-description from GoB website<br/><br/>Part of the Compact Game Series<br/>SKU GUI8030<br/>Boxed, 4.5&quot; x 5.75&quot; x 1.5&quot; game box<br/><br/>Difficulty Level: Easy<br/><br/>The box contains:<br/>1 10&quot;x15&quot; full color map<br/>1 11&quot;x17&quot; full color map in 2 pieces<br/>1 D10 die<br/>Rules<br/>136 full color die cut units<br/><br/>",

The goal of the game is to occupy the enemy airport with the pilot in the middle, surrounded by the planes. Movement is determined by the number die in any direction. If the color die shows the color of the active player, he gets another turn (up to 3 turns in a row). On the roll of a 6 a plane or the pilot has to be moved from ist starting position, if possible. If a figure lands on a space with an enemy figure, the enemy is sent back to a starting space, now including the 2nd line. The figures can't move into their own airport.<br/><br/>",

It is an adaptation of the well known game &quot;Pit,&quot; but instead of commodities like wheat, soybeans, corn... it uses the HOTTEST cryptos on the market!  Each card has must know facts about the coin itself and the game comes loaded with must know facts before investing.  Cryptocurrency is the biggest game changer since the invention of the internet, YET fewer than 1 in 4000 people even own a bitcoin!  Whether you are a serious investor or just want to have a fun time, this is the game for you!  Get ahead of the curve and have a blast!  Become familiar with crypto while playing the funnest game in your closet!<br/><br/>Bitcoin the Card Game is fun for ages 7+ and for 3-8 Players. Multiple decks can be used for larger groups! 78 cards per deck; 8 suits (coins) of 9 identical cards, a hacker card, a miner card, an instruction card, 2 must know bitcoin facts cards, and a future of bitcoin card.  Only the coins and the hacker and miner cards are used in game play.<br/><br/>OBJECT:<br/><br/>Be the first crypto trader to score a total of 5000 points.  As soon as the dealer yells, &quot;BITCOIN,&quot; you become a crypto coin trader trying to &quot;own the marker&quot; of one of the following 8 coins: Bitcoin, Ethereal, Litecoin, Monero, Bitcoin Cash, NEM, Dash, or Coinye West.  You &quot;own&quot; that particular coin when you have in your hand all 9 cards of the same coin.<br/><br/>SET UP<br/><br/>1. Select a dealer<br/><br/>2. Prepare a score sheet<br/><br/>3. Use one complete 9 card suit per each player in the game plus the hacker and miner cards.  Leave all other cards out of the game.<br/><br/>4. The dealer shuffles the deck and deals out all the cards in play face down.  Each player should have 9 and the players with the miner and hacker cards should have 10.<br/><br/>5. Pick up the cards and arrange them by suit.  Don't let anyone else see them.  Decide which coin you want to own.  Hint: pick the coin you have the most of in your hand.<br/><br/>6. When everyone has sorted their cards the dealer says, &quot;Bitcoin&quot; and the trading begins.<br/><br/>PLAY<br/><br/>As soon as the dealer said, &quot;bitcoin!&quot; everyone starts trading.  To trade, select 1-4 cards from your hand of the same suit that you do not want to own and say, &quot;one! one!&quot; or &quot;two! two!&quot; depending on how many cards you want to trade.  You may trade with any opponent who is calling out the same number.  Sometimes a particular opponent will want to trade fewer cards than you do.  In this case you can lower your bid and trade the smaller number.  you CANNOT look at the cards you are trading for until the trade is complete, NOT can you reveal which cards you are trading.  It is a race to see who can collect all 9 the quickest.  The first player to call out the coin they have once they own the coin wins the number of points associated with that particular coin.  No one else wins any points that round.<br/><br/>WILD CARDS<br/><br/>If someone goes out and you hold the miner and/or hacker cards you lose 200 points per wild card in your hand.  If you have 8 cards of a singer coin and the miner card, you may lay down all 9 (8 coins plus the miner card) and shout out &quot;DOUBLE BITCOIN, DOUBLE MONERO! etc..) In his case you win double the points on the card.  If you have the hacker card in your hand you may not lay down your cards until you have gotten rid of it.  You jay trade both cards together or separately or with another coin but you CANNOT trade more than 4 cards at a time.<br/><br/>COINYE WEST<br/><br/>This coin is worth much less than the other coins but if someone collects all 9 everyone else loses points.  Double Coinye means everyone also loses double as well!<br/><br/>WINNING<br/><br/>The game is played several times until a player has a total of 5000 points.<br/><br/>",

In the center are 3 sets of a row of 9 spaces, one each to be shared between each possible pair of players. That shared row acts as a fifth row of a board shared by a given pair of players; only those two given players may nter or cross through the space. As usual orientation of a piece marks ownership. All standard rules of shogi apply.<br/><br/>For a 3 player version, one player's partial board is simply eliminated.<br/><br/>Gameplay is clockwise. To use Western terminology, a player whose &quot;king&quot; is checkmated at the start of their turn-- whether by a single player-s pieces or by a combination of players' pieces-- is eliminated. The &quot;king&quot; is removed from the board&quot; and thereafter that player's turn is skipped. The last remaining player wins.<br/><br/>",

        "description": "In the future, explorers around the world discover secret staircases within ancient pyramids. At the bottom of the hundred thousand dusty steps are three doors. Anyone who opens a door is never heard from again. Whispered rumors speak of lost treasure, primeval technology, and nightmarish creatures. Powerfully driven adventurers arrive to bravely knock on DEATH&rsquo;S DOOR.<br/><br/>Each player in DEATH&rsquo;S DOOR has their own unique ways of gaining points centered around themes like exploring, killing, or looting. You win by completing the objectives described on your Story card and preventing other players from completing theirs. You must combine strategy, tactics, and diplomacy as you place and open dungeons, discover dangers, and gather powerful treasure.<br/><br/>Players start in different parts of the dungeon, and place tiles with a hex grid to create the board. You choose whether to join forces or fight solo. Lairs, with more monsters and a lair boss, are challenging and require multiple party members working together. The Final Boss is very difficult to defeat. The game ends when the Final Boss dies (everyone wins), or when there is one player left alive (highest score wins).<br/><br/>A simple yet dynamic attribute system defines the ability of players and monsters to engage the world. They describe how everyone attacks, defends, and acts. Taken together, they represent the health of the character. As you get bonuses to these attributes, you become more powerful. As you take damage, you become weaker. If all three attributes drop to one, the character is dead.<br/><br/>With only a dozen pages of rules and about two hours of play time, DEATH'S DOOR is designed to deliver RPG depth and lasting replayability that can be still learned and completed in one sitting.<br/><br/>&mdash;description from the designer<br/><br/>",

Even though an Army may have many Battalions, and far outnumber their enemy, if the soldiers are new to war, discipline, and command, those advantages can quickly evaporate.

You know if you can catch them, wealthy marine life enthusiasts will pay major moolah to add them to their collections. Yet, you aren&rsquo;t the only diver after these beasts of the big blue. Fortunately, you have a gift. The skill to charm and command smaller fish. It is with this talent in mind that you will go... Into the Sea.<br/><br/>How To Play<br/>Separate the cards in to two decks&ndash; one light blue, and one dark blue. Deal 2 light blue cards to each player. The player to the dealer's left has first turn.<br/><br/>During a turn, each player shall draw up to 3 cards (the hand limit) from the light blue deck, and play 1 card on the playing surface to create lines of the same colour fish (red, blue, yellow and green). Only 1 line for each colour is permitted at a time, and is shared by all players. When a card is played that increases a line of fish to 5 or more, a &quot;school&quot; is created&ndash; attracting a big sea creature. The player who placed the last card to create a school shall draw a card from the dark blue deck, briefly add it to that school for all to see, and finally collect the school, plus the big sea screature, to score the total of the number of points shown on each card.<br/><br/>Shrimp and Butterfly Fish are wild cards. They may join any colour line of fish. However, Butterfly Fish also let a player place a second card during his or her turn. Play continues clockwise.<br/><br/>The player to have scored the most points, once all sea creatures have been captured, wins!<br/><br/>",

Two players try to move 4 pawns from the base of the board beyond the dark spot between the snake heads. pawns that actually get on the dark spot have to begin anew. Movement is determined b a die. If the roll of the die shows a result that allows a pawn to get on the dark spot, it has to be used for this pawn. The small black dots (crossroads) can be occupied by any number of pawns of the same color. If a pawn gets on a crossroad, that is occupid by one or more pawns of the other color, the other pawns have to go back to the next crossroads behind them. If a pawn has the opportunity to reach a crossroads, it has to do that. The first player to get all 4 pawns off the game board beyond the dark spot wins the game.<br/><br/>",

You will choose the actions for each of your armies that will in turn, change the shape of the land and the outcome of the game.<br/><br/>Goal: The game of Resilience is played with 2 to 4 players, each attempting to be the first to build a level 4 stronghold and become the winner of the game. The levels of a stronghold are as follows: 1-Keep 2-Wall 3-Moat 4-Victory<br/><br/>The Game Board: The game is played on square land tiles that are laid down between the player's war camps. The land tiles are one of three types, Desert, Plains or Forest, each having a different land value associated with them. The more land value a player controls, the higher they can build their stronghold to win the game.<br/><br/>Some of the land tiles have mountains that limit where a player's commander can move to and may be rotated by the players to alter the game board, benefiting or hindering a player's strategy.<br/><br/>Game-Play: Each player has 3 commanders that they use to move around the game board and interact with the land tiles. On each player's turn, they may use each commander once to claim land tiles, use special abilities or battle opponent commanders.<br/><br/>Battle: Each commander has an army that is made up of 1 to 3 army cards. Army cards may be; Infantry, Archer, Cavalry or a Diplomat. In a Rock-Paper-Scissor fashion each player reveals cards, one at a time, from the commander army to battle: Infantry beats Cavalry, Cavalry beats Archer, Archer beats Infantry. The diplomat serves as the wild-card; when used in battle, both players are forced to roll a 6-sided die to determine the victor of that particular fight.<br/><br/>Trading: Players may trade away land tiles they control to other willing players, and in return, they re-collect army cards that have been discarded or resurrect fallen commanders.<br/><br/>Fun fact: No player can truly be eliminated. Even if a player looses all of their commanders and land tiles, they can always accept trade from other players, bringing them back into the game.<br/><br/>",

        "description": "This is one of a series of four card games published in the 1700s in France known collectively as the &quot;Cartes Historiques&quot;. While the box is not dated, Hargrave's History dates the deck to 1760.<br/><br/>L'Histoire Romaine has a deck of 48 cards, numbered with Roman numerals, plus a card with rules of the game. The cards are printed on thick stock from wood blocks, with square corners and blank backs. At the top of each card is the name of an historical character and a circled portrait. Below the portrait, and taking up most of the card, is a biography of the individual. The box shows E. Jouy as the author of the biographies.<br/><br/>The game seems to have been educational in nature, with the player drawing a card announcing its name, and the other player(s) having to come up with one or more relevant facts from the biography. Correct answers win the card, with the winner being the player who collects the most cards.<br/><br/>",

        "description": "This is a word game similar to Anagrams, but with the specific objective of forming the last names of 14 admirals who served in the U.S. Navy during or prior to the Spanish-American War. The game is named after Admiral of the Navy George Dewey, and seems to have been published to cash in on the glory of then Commodore Dewey's victory over the Spanish fleet at Manila Bay.<br/><br/>The names run in value from Admiral Albert S. Barker (10 points) to Admiral Dewey (100 points). The game contains 77 plain square letter tiles, one for each of the letters in the names on the list of admirals.<br/><br/>Players initially draw a hand of 10 tiles, and attempt to form, in whole or in part, names from the list. On each turn, a player draws a tile from the face-down stack, and if possible adds it to one of his names in progress. Instead of drawing from the stack, a player may steal a face-up tile from another player needed for one of his own names, provided that his own partial name is closer to completion than his opponent's. Letters may not be stolen from completed names. Completing a name grants an additional tile draw.<br/><br/>When the draw pile runs out, players may continue to steal, and the game ends when no further plays are possible. The winner is the player who completes the highest point-value worth of names.<br/><br/>",

        "description": "Shattered Nations is a strategic game where you pit an army of your own design against an opponent&rsquo;s army. Choose your actions and moves carefully, even one misstep can change the tide of battle and turn victory into defeat.<br/><br/>The goal of the game is to destroy all of your opponents commanders before they destroy yours.<br/><br/>Players will build an &ldquo;Army&rdquo; based off an agreed upon point army point value, deploy their army onto the battlefield, and attempt to destroy their enemy&rsquo;s commanders.<br/><br/>The battlefield is a simple yet devastating beast. Broken down into three separate zones, each zone provides a specific function to a player.<br/><br/>Command Line &ndash; The command line is the key to victory. This is where the army commanders start the game. Only commanders and heroes can be here.<br/><br/>Deployment Line &ndash; The Deployment line is how you get new troops onto the battlefield. You play cards from your hand into this location.<br/><br/>Front Line &ndash; The Front Line is where the action happens. Units must be on the front-line to attack the enemy.<br/><br/>To move your soldiers around and attack you will need to issue commands via action cards. Each turn players will only be able to perform three actions. There are 5 types of actions they can take. Each round players will pre-select their actions. This is critical because it locks you into those actions for that round. Not choosing wisely may result in you not being able to use all the actions allotted to you.<br/><br/>Attack Action: used for a unit in the Front-Line to attack the most forward unit in the opposing Command Line. Attacking with a unit &ldquo;exhausts&rdquo; the unit. (see combat section more details on attacking and killing units).<br/><br/>Deploy Action: used to move a unit from your hand to the deployment zone of an active Command Line. Deploying a unit &ldquo;exhausts&rdquo; the unit.<br/><br/>Advance Action: used to advance any unit forward in the same command line. Advancing a unit &ldquo;exhausts&rdquo; the unit.<br/><br/>Event Action: used to play an event card from your hand.<br/><br/>Ability Action: used to activate a unit&rsquo;s ability. Using a unit&rsquo;s ability &ldquo;exhausts&rdquo; the unit.<br/><br/>Combining these actions and clever use of the battlefield will assure you a victory. Be careful though, it is of paramount importance to interpret your opponent&rsquo;s battlefield and predict what actions they will be using.<br/><br/>Assemble your army, deploy your troops, destroy your enemies commanders!<br/><br/>",

The target audience includes students, science enthusiasts, nerds, and word game fans interested in learning an entirely new &ldquo;language&rdquo;. The style of play is familiar to those who have played other crossword-style board games, and the rules for compound formation come from chemistry itself.<br/><br/>Players make moves using a hand of ten tiles. Each tile is an element from the periodic table, although not every element is represented--only those found in relatively common compounds. A valid move creates a neutral compound with balanced charges. Compounds may be either binary (like carbon dioxide, methane, water, or ammonia) or involve polyatomic ions (sulfate, nitrate, hydroxide, etc.) Subsequent turns build new compounds using both new tiles and tiles already on the board. Players score points based on the point value of each tile (some elements are worth more than others), whether they are utilized in one direction or both horizontally and vertically, and whether they are played on special bonus squares. The game ends when one player runs out of tiles following the exhaustion of the general supply; at this time, the player with the most points wins.<br/><br/>",

The big difference is that in Magorum the player doesn&rsquo;t control any units such as monsters or robots or fighters. Instead, YOU are the center of the battle and you use YOUR power to perform amazing feats of magic and destruction in order to defeat the opponent. The only permanent cards on the field are the magical items that empower the player. In this fast-paced magical warfare, players have to use wit and strategy to overpower their opponent.<br/><br/>The main box set consists of 200 different cards which are divided into 5 different schools of magic: Ignogan (Fire), Aqualibrium (Water), Winderis (Air), Terrakov (Earth) and Gromnik (Electricity). Players can mix and match cards from different schools to create their ideal deck.<br/><br/>The players mix and match cards from each school to create a deck of 57 cards, and a side-deck of up to 7 cards. The players then take turns placing cards in the manapool and using the mana they've accumulated to cast spells and deal damage. Each point of damage equals 1 card discarded from the top of the opponent's deck.<br/><br/>The goal of the game is to deal enough damage to the opponent to discard all of the cards from their deck, thus winning the duel!<br/><br/>&mdash;description from the designer<br/><br/>",

Once the bell is rung, the guesser makes one guess trying to correctly identify what&rsquo;s written on the card. <br/>     The card is scored: A correct guess is worth one point. An incorrect guess is not worth any points. <br/>     The player to the left of the guesser becomes the new guesser and play continues.<br/>     When time runs out, continue the clue for the current card. After the guess is made, the round ends.<br/><br/><br/>The team with the most points at the end of the game wins!<br/><br/>&mdash;description from the publisher<br/><br/>",

        "description": "Revolt is a two-player space combat game set in the inner solar system; the map's outer edge is the orbit of Jupiter. One player represents a solar system government and the other player a rebellion against it.<br/><br/>Each side has a fleet of ships and a number of bases. Ship counters can represent any number of ships so each player knows where the other has forces but not how strong they are. The ships use vector movement; they can accelerate or decelerate a certain amount each turn and also change heading a certain amount (in 5-degree increments); their movement vectors are drawn on the board.<br/><br/>Combat is deterministic; the attacker's strength is divided by the distance between the attacker and defender to determine the number of strength points lost.<br/><br/>The sun's gravitational effects are taken into account for ship movement, but those of the planets are not. The planets and space stations move along their orbits during the game.<br/><br/>The objective of the government player is to eliminate all rebel ships and bases; the rebel player wins if they can avoid this for 30 turns.<br/><br/>The basic rules for the game were published in four issues of International Wargamer beginning with the December 1970 issue. The game was also available from the designers; this version included additional tournament rules and presumably also contained the map and counters, as they did not appear in the magazine.<br/><br/>",

Reader chooses a random card, reads the category (&quot;I am a land region,&quot; for example), and players take turns choosing a number. Reader reads the clue corresponding to that number (in this example, clue number 13 is: &quot;The name the Indians gave me means &quot;'Ground Afire'&quot;), and that player takes a single guess at the answer. If wrong, play progresses to next player (if multiple players). If correct, the player wins points equal to 20-the number of clues required to guess the answer. Play continues until one player or team reaches 50, or some other predetermined point total. Alternatively, a set number of cards or a time limit can be set, and highest points wins.<br/><br/>Target areas range from very obvious (Pacific Ocean) to slightly obscure (Denali National Park).<br/><br/>",

Additionally, prior experience with traditional wargames isn&rsquo;t required. ATC isn&rsquo;t a dice-rolling slugfest or a &ldquo;take that&rdquo; affair. Here, it&rsquo;s all about the card play: what to play, when to play it, what to discard, what to track, etc.<br/><br/>The game has two distinct phases, just like the actual battle. Players use action cards of various types to attack, defend, gain initiative, maneuver, emulate morale, take cover, use &ldquo;fog of war&rdquo; to their advantage, and so forth. Single &ldquo;duds&rdquo; are discarded, but pairs have a useful purpose.<br/><br/>A preponderance of &ldquo;split&rdquo; action cards ensures a nice variance from game to game. Components include 70+ cards and two maps.<br/><br/>&mdash;description from the designer<br/><br/>",

Each player commands an army of Archers, Pikemen, Mounted Archers, and Knights who fight to destroy the foe and win the day.<br/><br/>Players first choose which advanced tactics to use, if any, and then assemble the game board. Choose at least four of the fourteen square tiles and arrange them so all tiles are accessible and both players have an equal number of starting squares. For a challenge, use the Tactical Terrain side of the tiles.<br/><br/>Each player begins with between eight and twenty units of their choosing, deployed within the first three rows of their side of the board. Turn phases include Movement, Combat, and Resupply. Combat is resolved based on Unit Advantages, situational bonuses, and a roll of the dice. All phases are completed by a single player before their opponent may begin their turn.<br/><br/>In order to win, one player must eliminate all enemy forces from the field or outnumber their opponent's troops by more than 3-to-1.

The player&rsquo;s task is to collect as many pairs of cards as possible in the shortest period of time.  Eyegamer is a re-implementation of the classic memory game, with a minimalist, black &amp; white card design.  The minimalist design of the cards is designed to make it harder for you to match cards.<br/><br/>At the start of the game, shuffle and place the entire 40 card deck in a 10x4 (4 rows of 10 cards each) layout.  The cards should be placed so that the patterned side of the cards are face down, and the &quot;Eyegamer&quot; card backs facing up.<br/><br/>On your turn, simply pick any two cards and turn them over, showing the patterned sides.  If they match, remove them from play.  Each matched set should stay with the player/team that matched them.  If the chosen cards do not match, flip them back so that the &quot;Eyegamer&quot; card backs are facing up.  They remain in play.<br/><br/>At the end of the game, each matched set is worth 1 point.  The player/team with the most points wins the game.<br/><br/>There are three modes of play included in the game:<br/><br/><br/>     Solo - a 1 player challenge<br/>     Challenge - a 2 player challenge<br/>     Team Deathmatch - Up to 8 players (team sizes of 2 and 4 per team) with team members alternating turns choosing cards.<br/><br/><br/>You can also purchase multiple Eyegamer decks to create larger grids for the game, thus making the game more challenging.<br/><br/>",

Differences in the shapes of the space numbers suggest  calligraphy rather than printing, with irregularities in the shapes of the spaces pointing to a hand-drawn board as well.<br/><br/>Like many early board games, its theme is moral improvement. The game title translates as: &quot;In Heaven you will receive the Crown of Instruction&quot;.<br/><br/>In play, it is a typical spin-and-move along a 100-space track that spirals inward, with penalties and bonuses affecting various spaces along the way.<br/><br/>",

Remember the player with the highest total from these cards is the winner of the game.<br/><br/>Setup &amp; Starting<br/>Separate and shuffle the four different deck types, deal each player five American Dream Cards and one from each of the following decks; Life, Liberty, &amp; Pursuit of Happiness. The player will have all Life, Liberty, &amp; Pursuit of Happiness Cards face up in front of them.<br/><br/>The first card played in the timeline will be played by the oldest player, they must play their earliest American Dreams Card i.e. 1909.<br/><br/>Each player will take turns playing timeline cards and collecting or discarding Life, Liberty, &amp; Pursuit of Happiness Cards based off the actions the American Dreams Card has them take.<br/><br/>For your turn you please note that you may only play a card 1 to 3 years after the previous card played. For example: If a player lays down 1925 and you are the next player, you may play 1926, 1927, or 1928&mdash;if you do not have that card, your turn is skipped and discard an American Dreams Card of your choice.<br/><br/>History Behind the Game<br/>Each play you will most likely lose or gain Life, Liberty, &amp; Pursuit of Happiness cards each and every turn. The fluctuation mimics the point on the timeline when obtaining the American Dream was more difficult than in other years.<br/><br/>During Wartime players will find it most difficult to maintain their current point total, use your cards wisely during these time to ensure that you will have the most points when the Timeline reaches fifty years from the starting point. Winning And Losing The Game When fifty years has passed on the timeline, you may begin to tally the total from your Life, Liberty, &amp; Pursuit of Happiness cards. The player with the highest total is the winner.<br/><br/>Alternate Rules<br/>Century Play: Depending on which version of the game you will be playing with, this version of the game goes beyond fifty years, it will begin in 1901 and last the entirety of the American Dreams deck, all cards must be played.<br/><br/>When you play the card it must be the exact following year, if you do not have that card&mdash;draw another card. You will not discard in this scenario. All American Dreams cards will be played on the timeline.<br/><br/>Example Of Play<br/>Player One sets down 1904 to start the game, which causes them to collect one Happiness card, concluding their turn. Player Two sets down 1907 to follow, causing them to collect one Liberty card, concluding their turn. Player Three sets down 1910 to follow, causing them to lose one Life card. On Player One's second turn at play, they choose to use one of their Life, Liberty, &amp; Pursuit of Happiness cards that has an action&mdash;on this turn of play they have the option to trade a card with a fellow player. Player One chooses to take their 1 point value card and trade it for Player Two's 5 point value card.

Players earn points for pieces that are attached to the edges of their scoring square, plus pieces in their colour that are in the same row or column as their starting piece. In addition, being in the same row or column as the 'dictator' piece (a square of a third colour) doubles their points for that turn. The dictator can also be moved at the cost of 3 points.<br/><br/>Players continue to play rounds until one player reaches a set number of points, with that player being the winner.<br/><br/>",

If the player fails, the pawn will die. Also, if a player rolls 6, failing to roll 1 or 3, the player can use the bonus which he/ she got from a roll of 6 to try and roll 1 or 3. If the player fails again, he can use the bonus on any other pawns in the active play area.<br/><br/>",

Players draw scenario cards that will aid or inhibit their progress while trying to collect ghosts.<br/><br/>There are two types of cards, Ghost Cards and Haunt (scenario) Cards. Each turn, players go through a scenario and then try to collect as many ghosts into their canisters as they can, but they have to consider that ghost types do not always match, so they will have to empty out canisters quite often to make room for new ghost types. This can cause heartbreak, but it can also put a player in the lead if they play their cards right.<br/><br/>Players' hands represent the radars used as the Ghost Raiders, therefore they can't rearrange the order of cards in their hands.<br/><br/>Players take their turns by doing the following:<br/>1. Draw a Haunt card.<br/>2. Draw or Discard Ghost cards.<br/>3. Play a Ghost card.<br/>4. Re-scan the room (Draw a Ghost card face-up, draw another Ghost card face-down).<br/>5. Exchange Ghost cards.<br/>6. End your turn.<br/><br/>",

        "description": "SUMMARY <br/>All but one of the players will take on the role of a hero (who are part of the same guild) that is participating in a great competition known as &ldquo;The Dungeon Games&rdquo;. These events, created by the world&rsquo;s greatest magicians, are pulse-pounding, unpredictable and timed. Each player will need to make use of every round they have available to them, either trying to complete the main objective or grabbing &ldquo;Arcane Keys&rdquo; that are scattered around the environment for some vital extra points. The last player will take on the special role of Storyteller, who uses the prewritten adventures (or their own) to run the story the other players participate in. They function as a referee of sorts, playing all the NPCs and baddies in the combat (in Dice Odyssey, the Storyteller will try to defeat the heroes in combat by choosing a good combination of baddies and selecting their actions carefully).  The game is composed of 2 main systems, Exploration and Combat.<br/><br/>EXPLORATION SYSTEM<br/>Each adventure will give the players a set number of rounds to complete it in. When a player takes a turn, he will tell the Storyteller what he plans to do, it&rsquo;s up to the Storyteller to gauge how many rounds it would take to accomplish it. Another simple element that makes this game feel completely unique are the Arcane Keys. They are collectables that are scattered everywhere, each one having some sort of puzzle or trial involved in getting to it. The Arcane Keys allow more opportunities for each person on the team to be helpful. For example, if the main objective requires Stealth and Athletics, then the Arcane Keys that are close by, will be Wits and Lore based. At every moment, all attributes are useful, and Arcane Keys are the main reason why.<br/><br/>Whenever a player attempts to do something difficult, they will have to roll dice to see if they are successful. The number of dice they roll is determined by the attribute the Storyteller says is needed for the task and how many of that type of Attribute Card they have. For example, if a player needs to push a large sleeping giant out of the way, the Storyteller will tell him it will take an athletics roll, and what number he will have to roll to be successful, in this case, a 6. The player will look to see if he has an athletics Attribute Card, and will roll an additional die for each that he has. The base roll being 3 dice. There are 8 attributes; Athletics, Dungeoneering, Fortitude, Lore, Luck, Stealth, Vigilance and Wits. On each Attribute Card there is also some sort of boon, perhaps for Fortitude, a hero may have &ldquo;Bark Skin&rdquo;. This element can be used creatively to help the player throughout the quest, and ultimately is up to the Storyteller. Generally, the rule is, if they can explain how they are using it for a task, they can convert the Attribute Card to a different type. Using the card above &ldquo;Bark Skin (Fortitude)&rdquo;, a player hides next to a tree after stripping down. This could convert the Attribute Card from Fortitude to Stealth for the use of that one roll.<br/><br/>COMBAT SYSTEM<br/>In most RPGs, heroes have some base stats that do not change, such as HP, defense, attacks, etc. But in Dice Odyssey, players can change their heroes &ldquo;base stats&rdquo;. Imagine a normally defensive, tough hero, who is putting his guard down to do extra damage this turn, in Dice Odyssey, that means he would have chosen a different Combat Card this turn. Players begin combat by assessing the baddies they are fighting, their teammates strengths and weaknesses and from that, what Combat Card would be most appropriate. Most heroes have 5 different Combat Cards, and can swap between those cards during the game by buying them at the store.<br/><br/>After the baddies have been laid out, the players will also each grab 4 of the dice from their bags and roll them to see which of their Loot Cards they can use this round of combat. Each point rolled on a die, will allow the player to activate that many points on the corresponding Loot Card. For example, if they roll a 1 on a Fey die, they can pick which Fey card they want to activate (if they have more than one) and then pick which of the 3 (1 point) powers they want to use. If they were to roll a 2 instead, they could choose 2 (1 point) powers on that card. The Loot Cards serve as an add-on to the player's Combat Card. After 2 uses the Loot Cards break, at which point, you have to discard it and put one of your dice of that type back in the main bag. <br/>There is more to the combat system, but this covers most of it.<br/><br/>CONCLUSION<br/>If the players are able to finish the main quest in the time allotted, they receive a point for each Arcane Key they were able to escape with. Depending on how many points they have, the heroes will be in 1st &ndash; 5th place. The actual victory is if they are able to complete the mission at all, the bonus points serve as a high score mechanic. It is also fun to replay the same quest to see if you can get the number one spot!<br/><br/>",

Most of this changed after Guadalcanal, where elite Japanese forces and US Marines experienced heavy losses. By that time, US Army National Guard divisions had greatly improved. Throughout the fighting in the South Pacific the Australians were widely regarded as having provided the most proficient and effective infantry. Fighting in the South Pacific was not homogeneous.<br/><br/>Each campaign and island provided a unique set of circumstances. <br/>This supplement adds Japanese morale result tables, Banzai Charges, Night Infiltration, Die in Place, Hidden Japanese Positions, with a detailed vehicle and weapons list.<br/><br/>The requirement for new action decks for the Japanese is not required but makes the game easier.<br/><br/>",

The game was developed on a public forum and accepted input from users through two major revisions until a final publication date.<br/><br/>Play uses many methods common to traditional wargaming.  Movement and distances are presented in &quot;inches&quot; and determined with the use of a tape measure.  Modified six-sided dice rolls are used to determine many outcomes.  Various arena tokens are used to denote alterations to the battlefield that occur during play.<br/><br/>Each player controls the units of an opposing force.  Forces are built using a points pool.  As these calculations can become rapidly tedious, numerous armies and forces are provided by a variety of forum users.<br/><br/>Each unit in each force is represented by a model that is placed on the play surface.  Models have a paper record that tracks various statistics and play values such as speed, armor, ammunition, and so forth.  Units may make attacks on opposing units as long as they have the range, remaining ammunition or power, and line of sight.  Successful attacks deal damage that may destroy, disable, or partially disable targets.<br/><br/>Play proceeds in alternating player turns, each half-turn being sub-divided into movement, fire, and assault phases.  Victory conditions are set before the scenario begins and typically involve force destruction or &quot;capture the flag&quot; goals.

        "description": "Scrollhammer 2nd Edition is a miniatures wargame with a setting derived from the Elder Scrolls media franchise.  It is notably distinct from Scrollhammer because Scrollhammer 2nd Edition uses a completely original move and combat system.  The game has gone through repetitive playtest/revision cycles, leading to numerous (iterative) versions, each published as a static PDF from 2013 through 2017.<br/><br/>Scrollhammer 2nd Edition focuses primarily on squad-based skirmishing where opposing players control a force composed of individual units, each unit represented on the play surface by a model.  Each model has a corresponding data card.  Scenarios may use either pre-determined setup or a deployment zone method.<br/><br/>Models should conform to a 25mm standard; the play surface is assumed to be flat (terrain is indicated but not created).  Distance and movement are performed in &quot;inches&quot;, determined by tape measure.<br/><br/>Each turn is divided into two half-turns, one for each player.  Initiative determines which player acts first.  During each turn, every model may take two Actions (during the controlling player phase) and take one Reaction (during the opposing player phase).  Attacks may be made on any other model that is in range and which is in &quot;line of sight&quot; of the attacker.  Attacks and other opposed situations are resolved by a modified six-sided die roll.  Attacks may destroy, disable, or partially disable the target.<br/><br/>Special rules cover command influence, cover, missile and thrown weapons, dual-wielding combat weapons, blast attacks, and so forth.  The game utilizes a magic system as an organic component; magical effects are circumscribed and are &quot;low powered&quot; in scope.<br/><br/>Scenarios use a pre-determined victory condition and play proceeds until the condition is achieved.  Many pre-built units are presented in the rules (custom unit creation is supported but complex).<br/><br/>&mdash;user summary<br/><br/>",

        "description": "In Act of Treason, players take on the role of Royal Advisors tasked with ruling a Kingdom in the wake of the Kings death. Players are given a secret loyalty card, assigning them as a Traitor, Loyal, or the Heir in hiding. Loyals win by rooting out and eliminating the Traitors, or passing five Quests to safely herald in the new King. Traitors win when four Quests fail, or by finding and assassinating the Heir. Players will scheme, deceive, and persuade in order to complete their objectives.<br/><br/>Each round, players contribute Knowledge cards in secret towards a Quest. Knowledge that matches the colour of the Quest will increase the chance of it passing, whilst off-colour cards increases the chance of failure. Players may vie for powerful Court cards, plot assassinations, or simply pass their action while they garner information. Play continues until the Loyals win and the Heir is safe, or the Traitors win and the Kingdom is left to ruin. As the game progresses, tensions will rise. Players will resort to accusations and assassinations in a last ditch effort to save the Kingdom, or force its destruction.<br/><br/>Act of Treason was inspired by social deduction games like Mafia, Werewolf, and Battlestar Galactica. It takes many aspects of these games and seeks to amplify what makes them so much fun: the social interaction, suspicion and deception! In Act of Treason, the only thing that stands between you and victory is your ability to read, bluff, and persuade others.<br/><br/>",

Sounds easy? Budget restraints, wild weather  and angry citizens all contribute to the city&rsquo;s decline. <br/>Oh and don't get me started on the 100 foot tall dinosaurs or flying saucers...<br/><br/>The game takes place over 8 game days and players take the roles of city officials trying to protect the city from damage, rioting and disease.<br/><br/>Players use their city budgets to put crews into the city blocks to counter the news events that bring further disaster and ruin to the streets.<br/><br/>If you can survive to the end of your watch and have most of the city still up and running you win as a team. But lose too many city blocks or too many citizens to disease rioting or other dangers and you are fired and removed from office.<br/><br/>Each Player has a set of budget dice and there are federal budget dice which are divided among players according to the needs of the city.<br/><br/>Your budget can be assigned to actions to counter damage that takes place during the game. (Each round event cards dictate the headlines for that round and the damage that is caused). <br/>These actions could be to put out fires, heal the diseased, control unruly citizens repair infrastructure and reconnecting utilities. Be careful though you also need budget to move your work crews around the city.<br/><br/>If any of these issues get out of control they can spread very quickly. Losing 3 city blocks or all of the damage counters of any type results in instant dismissal from the City Disaster council and disgrace for your team.<br/><br/>Watch your HQ as well if that burns down or is damaged beyond repair the same result can take place.<br/><br/>With 4 difficulty levels this game can be a light entertaining game right through to nearly impossible odds. This might seem repressive but beating the game on Expert level is a great boost.<br/> Solo play can be played in the normal way but the Solo story mode involves scenarios that build upon each other.<br/><br/>",

The length of this line depends on a leader's rank. <br/> A simple and concise chit pull system determines initiative while a bare bones D6 combat system moves battles along quickly and decisively across a 13 x 13 square battle grid.<br/><br/>Numerous ways to win include: Capturing your opponents objectives, eliminating leaders or simply inflicting more casualties than you receive.

With the tour-de-force inventiveness which fuels his already-classics Press Here, Mix It Up!, and Let's Play!, Herv&eacute; Tullet's open-ended game stimulates creative thinking and fosters imagination.<br/><br/>This open-ended game fosters creative thinking and imagination with lots of different ways to play. Here are a few to get you started.<br/><br/>MATCHING GAME: A clever memory challenge for 2 or more players<br/>Spread the cards out color-side down in 4 rows of 11 cards each. The youngest player goes first and turns over 2 cards. If the pictures match, the player gets to keep the cards and take another turn. If the pictures don&rsquo;t match, the player turns the cards back over, and it is the next player&rsquo;s turn. Players take turns flipping the cards over and looking for matches. The game ends when all the cards have been matched. The player with the most matches wins. Note: For younger children, the game can be played with fewer cards; try 24 or 32 cards. For a more difficult game, spread the cards out not in rows but in a random pattern!<br/><br/>ROADBUILDER: Matching up lines for 2 to 4 players<br/>Locate 1 of the black-and-white crossroads cards and place it in the center of the table. Each player picks 1 of the 4 sides of the card to build from. Place the remaining cards in the deck color-side down. Players take turns drawing a card from the deck and placing them on the table color-side up, matching up the lines to make as long a &ldquo;road&rdquo; as possible from their side. If a player reaches a dead end, he or she sits out the rest of the round. When no player can continue their &ldquo;road,&rdquo; all players collect the cards they&rsquo;ve played and set them aside. Repeat, building new &ldquo;roads&rdquo; until all the cards are exhausted. The player with the most cards wins!<br/><br/>PATTERNGROWER: A collaborative visual adventure for 1 or more players.<br/>This game should be played on the floor or another large surface, because the designs can get very big! Using both sides of the cards, players work together to make the largest possible design while still matching up all the lines. Try playing with all cards color-side up. Or try placing each fourth card black-side up.<br/><br/>See if you can come up with some variations of these games on your own!<br/><br/>-description from publisher<br/><br/>",

On their turn, players can look at an incorrect location card to get info on the right one, but then they have to discard a card, having only four in hand until the end of the game, although maybe they will be able to play their cards for powers, allowing them to take back discarded cards, draw a card, then discard one,...<br/><br/>They can also chose to flip a jewel token.

        "description": "The game, Do Not Die, is a tile game that focuses on managing player vitals and resources while simply trying to stay alive and find rescue.<br/><br/>Players can build shelters, loot cabins, hunt and fish for food, even cozy up to a nice campfire. But make no mistake, the goal here is survival. Players must stay alive and find their way out, even if that means player vs. player combat.<br/><br/>&quot;Do Not Die&quot; is fast paced and exciting with deep complexity and many available strategies. It makes all players compete against each other but also has the game itself as the primary challenger.<br/><br/>The mechanics involved push the players forward and if they lose sight of their primary objective, survival becomes impossible. It can also be played cooperatively, eventually joining player tiles. The game even has a vast and engaging solitary mode for single player action. (Game length = 60 minutes / Players = 1-5 / Ages = 10+)<br/><br/>This turn-based game uses Player Boards where each player manages four individual vitals; Temperature, Hunger, Thirst, &amp; Fatigue. At the end of their turn, each player adds up the HP damage associated with each vital and subtracts it from their health meter. The Health Meter starts at thirty and once the player reaches zero, they lose.<br/><br/>The game also has a Main Game Board. The Main Game Board has Player Cards that sets the environment for each player and Weather Cards that control the weather for the day. Distributed in the Weather Deck, there are six Exposure Cards that increase the Exposure Level. This Exposure Level lowers each players vitals at the beginning of each player turn. The player must perform six actions each turn to try to counteract this effect and manage their vitals to avoid dying.<br/><br/>There are sixty-four tiles in this game that the player uncovers by using actions to explore their surroundings. They consist of the following:<br/><br/>Frozen Ground Tile - Used for hunting Varment for food +1<br/>Frozen Lake Tile - Used for Fishing for food +1<br/>Forest Tile - Used for hunting Small Game for food +4<br/>Mountain Tile - Used for hunting Large Game for food +6<br/>Cabin Tile - Used for looting Tools and Items<br/>Fire Tower Tile - Used for Rescue<br/><br/>In order to gain helpful resources in the game, the player can craft things like campfires, shelters, water, and some simple tools using player actions. Other Items and Tools can be found in the game by revealing a Cabin Tile and looting it. Each player can only loot a revealed cabin once. When a cabin is looted, the player rolls one black die (for an Item Card) and two white dice (for Tool Cards). If they roll an even number, then they select the corresponding Tool or Item Cards from the decks. The goal always remains, Do Not Die.<br/><br/>",

The higher an item is on the deployment panel the higher the cost players must pay, but sometimes the cost must be paid to get out of a tricky situation, or gain an undisputed advantage.<br/><br/>Once players decide what to buy they must deploy the item on the map of Liriam and this is where the tactical and strategical layers surface in King of Liriam. Each unit features a combination of 2 traits, the way it enters the map and the ability it performs once arrived. For instance units can conquer new territories, patrol existing ones, or siege nearby enemy settlements.<br/><br/>The goal of the game is to own more territories than the enemy by the time the map fills.<br/><br/>",

        "description": "The Beautiful Game: TCG (Trading Card Game) is a tabletop board game incorporating an optional trading card system to introduce more player cards and tactical 'Event Cards'. It is a 2 player game that can be played for any duration, but it is recommended that players play 60 or 90 minutes, broken down into two halves.<br/><br/>The game starts with players choosing their teams. In the Kick Off Edition, players will draft their teams face-up from the pool of players. The player cards are then assigned to a number which corresponds to a player piece on the pitch. The game is then played using the stats on the player cards and rolls of the D20 against these stats when necessary to perform certain actions such as shooting or tackling. The game is quick and fluid to play and involves no measuring of distances other than counting spaces on the pitch.<br/><br/>Extra tactics and gameplay elements are introduced to the game via 'Event Cards' &ndash; a 50 card (minimum) deck of cards that can help you or hinder your opponent. The Kick Off Edition features pre-constructed Event Card decks.<br/><br/>When playing the game, the player in possession of the ball (the attacking player) leads play but the defending player is still heavily involved in influencing how the attacker can play. The defending player chooses to try mark attackers and can play Event cards to hinder their chances in order to try win back possession.<br/><br/>The winner is the player who has scored the most goals at the end of the game!<br/><br/>&mdash;description from the publisher<br/><br/>",

These cards have all kinds of effects that cause damage or hinder the other players in some way. You can even call on your neighbors to come fight at your side.<br/><br/>There are 5 card types in the STOOPID Core Deck; each one does something different.<br/><br/><br/>     Accidents<br/>     Happenings<br/>     Neighbors<br/>     Skirmish<br/>     Things<br/><br/><br/>The goal of STOOPID is to use your cards to knock the other player(s) health down to zero and out of the game. But are they?!.<br/><br/>When playing STOOPID with 3 or more players, the players that get &quot;knocked out&rdquo; become ghosts. As ghosts they use their Skirmish (red) cards to haunt the players that are still alive.<br/><br/>&mdash;description from the publisher<br/><br/>",

Roll the dice and mime the charade listed next to the number you've rolled. Start the egg timer. Your team must correctly guess the charade you are miming before the egg timer runs out. If they do, your team wins a point. If not, the next team in line can take a guess. If they  guess correctly, they take the point.<br/><br/>INDICATING THE CATAGORY:<br/>Films - Pretend you are cranking an old fashioned movie camera.<br/>TV - Draw a rectangle with your index finger.<br/>Books - Pretend to unfold your hands as if they were a book opening.<br/>Songs - Pretend to sing into a microphone.<br/>To indicate how many words are in the charade, hold the correct number of fingers against your opposite arm.<br/><br/>MIMING: To mime is to use only gestures and movements to act out, it does NOT include speaking, mouthing words or verbalising in any form! You may not indicate objects within the place you are playing to help your teammates.<br/><br/>WINNING THE GAME: The first team to reach 15 points wins.<br/><br/>MOVIE AND SOUNDTRACK QUIZZES.<br/><br/>BEFORE YOU GET STARTED: Split the players into even teams and make sure you have a pen and paper to record your scores.<br/><br/>RULES FOR PLAY: The beginning team draws a card, asks the other team a question and starts the egg timer.

Each player takes turns to ask a question such as, &quot;Am I female?&quot;, &quot;Am I alive?&quot;, &quot;Did I invent something?&quot;, ect. Each player takes turns to ask a question. If the player guesses their identity using 5 question or less, they get 3 points. If they guess using between 6 and 10 questions, they get 2 points. Between 11 and 15 questions gets 1 point and if the player does not guess who they are within 15 questions, they score no points.<br/><br/>WINNING THE GAME: The first player to reach 15 points wins.<br/><br/>",

The deck consists of 56 cards that measure just 2.25&quot; by 1.25&quot;. The cards are printed with black ink on plain cardboard, with one side showing the name of a country followed by four geographical features related to that country. The back side is an advertisement for the company's beds.<br/><br/>To begin, players first form a pool of face-up cards equal to the number of players. There are then two rules variations: players either start with a hand of six, leaving a face-down draw deck, or the entire remaining deck is distributed at the outset.<br/><br/>Starting from the dealer's left, a player may first pick up a card from the pool if it completes a &quot;trick&quot; of the four cards related to a country. He then may ask any other player for one of the cards (by name and then feature) from a nation in which he already holds at least one card. If available, the other player must hand over the card, and the asking player may continue. As soon as the asking player fails to win a card, he must add one card from his hand to the pool, and play passes to the left.

        "description": "Thin-card covered booklet of rules for a campaign game based on the Aerial Dogfight Rules 1916-18 - to be used to follow a campaign for just a single squadron v squadron or involving multiple squadrons or 'airforces'.  It uses map movement for aircraft until combat occurs or an objective is reached where individual aircraft (presumes scale models but could use counters) then are placed on a table for tactical play. Most of the rules are concerned with expanding the dogfight game to a multi-day campaign using maps but some are for expanding the play on a table with aircraft to include bombing, AA fire, ground attack and balloon-busting.<br/><br/>11 pages of rules cover squadron types and sizes, pilot experience, wounds, campaign points, heavy bomber campaigns, navigation (optional), map movement, visibility, AA, bombs, ground attack, balloon-busting, replacements and repairs, weather (optional).<br/><br/>Rest of the booklet consists of 24 pages of aircraft charts (one aircraft per page), several sheets for orders, templates for a movement protractor, a wind indicator and counters.<br/><br/>Two map sheets are loose in the centre - one small map with a simplified (made-up) version of the Western Front and a larger one with SE England and Western Germany on opposing sides.<br/><br/>",

Each player leads one of the 4 alien factions that try to guarantee their survival by plundering the genetic material (material token) of the opposing factions. The first player to acquire 4 material tokens wins the game. At the beginning of the game, the abilities of each faction are symmetrical (which also makes it easier to understand the game).  Each player develops his own faction's abilities during the game based on his strategy of adapting and his playing affinities, the game then takes on a highly asymmetrical twist.<br/><br/>Players must conquer energy Source-cities, manage their energetic and opposing networks in order to increase their power. Players must also move their units carefully to guard against hostile reactions from the fauna and flora.<br/><br/>Glow in the darkness has mechanisms and a unique gameplay including:<br/>- a common semi-hidden deckbuilding for the improvement of factions<br/>- a common action system with semi-hidden orders (which favors manipulation between players)<br/>- a controlled &quot;action anomaly&quot;promoting bold strategies<br/>- the morphe system for the specialization of faction capabilities<br/>- a sequential combat resolution system  <br/>- a biome with an autonomous and interactive evolution, including a mechanism of procedural generation associated with a comparative and adaptive mechanism of fauna and flora.<br/>- major evolution of the scary game (based on recent scientific studies concerning: fear)<br/>- the original and subtle management of resources through the construction of energy networks<br/><br/>A game for 2-4 players 14+ years old.

If you draw an Always card you will do the wacky thing on your card every time it's your turn. A Whenever card directs you to do what the card says whenever another player does something specific. One wacky thing definitely leads to another in this zany game of craziness!<br/><br/>SET UP<br/><br/>     3 players randomly choose a prop card<br/>     Shuffle the action cards and put them facedown in a pile within reach of all players<br/>     Decide how many rounds to play. With 4-5 players, 8 rounds are recommended. With more players, less rounds. With less players, more rounds. When every player has picked an action card that is one round. <br/><br/><br/>PLAY<br/><br/>     On your turn, draw an action card from the top of the deck and place it face up in front of you. Each time you draw an action card, add it to the row of action cards in front of you.<br/>     Read the action card aloud to all the players very carefully. Each card has a point value 1-12 based on the zaniness of the action.  <br/>     There are two types of action cards:<br/>         Always-if you draw an always card, do the zany thing immediately. Then repeat that zany thing every time it's your turn. <br/>         Whenever-if you draw a whenever card, do nothing right now. However read the card carefully because you will need to do whatever zany thing is on the card whenever another player does a specific zany thing.<br/>    <br/><br/><br/><br/>     Don't forget to read the Prop Cards and pass them around throughout the game. There are 3 different prop cards:<br/>         Funny Glasses-when you have this card, wear the glasses until someone stands for any reason. Then pretend you're a teacher and say something really smart. Then pass the glasses and card to the player on your left. <br/>         Microphone-when you have this card, hold the microphone until someone sings. Then sing into the microphone along with them. When you're done singing, pass the Microphone and Card to the person on your left. <br/>         Engagement Ring-when you have this card, wear the ring until someone kisses anything. Then run over, get down on one knee, and give the kisser the ring.<br/>    <br/><br/><br/><br/>     Once during the game, each player can pick one of his or her action cards and give to another player. But remember that in addition to giving that player something really zany to do, you are also givin g him or her points. And that might cause you to lose the game. <br/>     It's ok to remind players if they forget to do one of the things on the action cards in front of them. After all, the whole point of the game is to see everyone act really silly!<br/><br/><br/>WINNING<br/><br/>     After the agreed upon number of rounds, players add up the points on the action cards. The player with the highest score wins. <br/><br/><br/>",

(2 is the lowest value and 12 is the highest value card.)The next player places a card down from their hand that has an equal or higher value than the card previously played on the played pile.<br/><br/>If a player has more than one of the same card they can play as many of those same valued cards during his turn.<br/>Example: If a player has two &ldquo;5&rdquo; cards in his hand, they can play both of the cards if they want to at the same time.<br/>When 4 cards of the same value are played consecutively in turn those 4 cards and all cards in the played pile are no longer played in the game and go into the discard pile.<br/>If the next player cannot play an equal or higher valued card onto the played pile from their hand, that player picks up all of the played cards on the played pile and adds them to their hand.<br/>The player that picks up all of the cards from the played pile has &ldquo;Tough Luck&trade;&rdquo;! They must play the cards in their hand before they can go back and play from the cards in front of them.<br/><br/>End of Game: The first player that runs of out cards wins the game.<br/><br/>It is possible that your last card may be a RESTART &mdash; Play it and win the game, a RESET &mdash; Play it and win the game or a REVERSE &mdash; Play it and win the game!<br/><br/>Special Play Cards:<br/><br/>REVERSE:  The REVERSE cards reverses the play of the game (counter-clockwise to clockwise, etc).  If a player plays a REVERSE card the next player has to match or beat the card they just played.  If you play a REVERSE card your turn is finished. In a 2-Player game if you play a REVERSE card you get to go again.<br/><br/>RESET: The RESET cards clears the pile of cards that everyone is playing on.  These cards are no longer used in the game and go into a discard pile.  If you play a RESET card your turn is finished.<br/><br/>RESTART: The RESTART cards resets the deck to whatever value card the player chooses.  The player plays the RESTART card and then can play whatever card they want to from their hand.<br/><br/>Game Play Variation:Try playing with less cards in front of you and more cards in your hand or vice-a-versa to add a different challenge!<br/><br/>",

The gears of the Industrial Era are shaping the old English Kingdom into an Empire so big that the sun is always shining on it.<br/><br/>The tempting wealth of the colonies represent a golden opportunity for you to increase your status but if you really want to be ambitious, you must dare to manipulate the political scenario and get the best advantages, otherwise you&rsquo;ll learn a bitter lesson: one plot is worth more than a million pounds!<br/><br/>Contenders will build ships to reach distant places like Canada, Australia and India. They will establish colonial houses and bring their workers in order to grow in power and wealth. This power assumes the form of influence towards the crown and it is the crown that can best serve all player&rsquo;s interests.<br/><br/>During three rounds, players will select actions to perform both in England and in the colonies. It is a very demanding scenario, divided in two, with all players splitting their attention and trying to be as sharp and efficient as a context like this obliges.<br/><br/>You&rsquo;ll need influence to perform actions in England but, to get this influence, money needs to be spent in the colonies. Invest wise, collect more!<br/><br/>Money and status quo combined represent the wealth hold by each player and, in the end of the game, the wealthiest player will be called victorious.<br/><br/>&mdash;description from the publisher<br/><br/>",

        "description": "Isabel is a two-player game portraying the War of Castilian Succession (1475-1479). The death of King Enrique IV in 1474 created a domestic crisis in the Kingdom of Castile. The two contenders for the throne were Isabel, Enrique&rsquo;s half-sister, and Juana, the 13-year-old daughter of the late monarch. Both women counted with powerful allies in their fight for the throne: in 1469 Isabel&rsquo;s had wed Fernando, heir to the Crown of Aragon, and Juana married King Alfonso V of Portugal during the early stages of the war. In Isabel, the players assume the role of Isabel and Juana and their respective allies as they compete to garnish domestic and international support for their cause. The players face a multifaceted conflict fought as much in the arenas of Spain and the African coast as in the undecided hearts of the Castilian nobility and population at large.<br/><br/>Over four rounds, the players compete by maneuvering troops on the Iberian Peninsula and the Atlantic coast, and by gaining the alliance of various noble houses, public opinion, and international powers. Isabel&nbsp;incorporates streamlined mechanics that are attentive to the historical circumstances of the conflict. Every turn, players face multiple strategic choices which, taken secretly, require tactical reconsideration made in reaction to the opponent&rsquo;s chosen actions.&nbsp;Isabel&nbsp;forces the players to constantly consider the risk-reward of their choices. With a limited amount of available resources, players have to decide when to sacrifice assets to obtain substantial one-time benefits.<br/>&nbsp;<br/>&mdash;description from the designer<br/><br/>",

The player who finished first is not necessarily the winner, as players collect fame points through various feats, including reaching the most mountaintops or visiting the most map tiles.<br/><br/>The game contains 8 double-sided modular map tiles, 110 cards, 4 custom-shaped wooden cars and fuel tokens, several player boards and bonus tiles, among other components.<br/><br/>",

(While undated, it probably pre-dates Parker Bros. 1895 Waterloo.)<br/><br/>The game is for 2 - 7 players, each of whom plays the role of one of the Coalition commanders advancing on Napoleon's central position: Blucher or von Bulow for the Prussians, von Schwartzenberg or von Klenau for the Austrians, Benningsen or Prinz Eugen for the Russians, or Karl Johann Bernadotte of Sweden.<br/><br/>Each player has a unique track toward Leipzig as well as an illustrated player card with a biography on the front and rules governing each of the red-colored points along that player's track. Each turn, a player throws three D6, and if the result is 9 or higher, advances his piece one space. Each red space has an additional requirement that can lead to penalties or bonuses. Each track also has a battle to be won along the way (with the map noting the defending French commander). Moving past the battle requires a roll of 10 or higher on 2D6.<br/><br/>Players put 6 marks in the pot to start, and may lose or win money from the pot along the way. The first player to reach Leipzig (space 14) wins whatever pot remains.<br/><br/>",

Time to exercise our brain and reinforce our math skills.<br/><br/>There are 26 cards in total, full of numbers and colors:<br/><br/>0-10 card numbers x 2 <br/>One of each magic cards. These are - square, square-root, timer (pauses the opponent for 15 seconds) and scissors (to remove one of the goal numbers).<br/><br/>Deal each player 5 number cards. Deal two cards between the players; this is the goal-number. They use minus, plus, multiply and divide to the get the two-digit goal number. Whoever gets the answer first, wins the game. You can replace two cards but this takes extra time. You can also use the six as a nine.<br/><br/>Unsuccessfully funded on Kickstarter March 2015. However, during the campaign, there was a print and play version available and also a few months after on their official website<br/><br/>",

It was published by Swedish Alga during the World War II and the playing pieces is dressed in contemporary bluish grey or light brown uniforms.<br/><br/>It has some differences compared to L'Attaque and Stratego (see its reimplementation Batalj for closer details) but the game play is similar. Place your army the way you wish and the battle commence. Move your pieces and attack the enemy, highest rank wins the many individual skirmishes, with the usual exception of the Spy, who will beat the opposing General. The winner is the player that has managed to either wipe out the opposing force or make the opposer unable to move his/hers pieces further. There is no standard or flag in this game, but both sides has four mines.<br/><br/>",

Each stock card has a color which is always known and a numeric value ranging from 1 to 7 which is often public, but could be claimed secretly. Claiming low value cards grants the player a one-time ability that increases their odds of collecting points. The actual victory point value of each color is determined collectively by all players via trackers on the supply wheel. The values on the wheel rise slowly, crash quickly then cycle back around. The value for each color is tracked independently and is only awarded to the highest shareholders when a supply of stocks runs out. Players attempt to determine which stocks are best to collect, get the highest total of them, and maximize their value at just the right time.<br/><br/>Victory points are only awarded at the end of each each round. After three rounds, the player with the most points wins.<br/><br/>Color Spiel was chosen as the winner of the 2017 HABA USA Game Design Contest.<br/><br/>",

        "description": "A strategy game which aims to be an abstraction of contemporary society in the same way that Chess is an abstraction of feudalism. Each player has ten pieces: a man, woman, and child (people); a wheel, column and bullet (tools); a shield; and three pragmas. People and pragmas cannot attack people, and the child cannot attack tools. Shields cannot be attacked at all except from behind.<br/><br/>The object of the game is to score points by attacking the opponent's people and pragmas, or by occupying special spots on the board known as &quot;origons&quot;. The game ends immediately if one player occupies all four origons, or if one player has lost two of their three people. Otherwise the game continues until a predetermined score is reached.<br/><br/>&mdash;user summary<br/><br/>",

This attempt failed when she redirected His power to one of the Silent Ones, a woman named Snow. The Tyrant's power manifested in the form of a massive wendigo bound to Snow, which later was named Storm.<br/><br/>At first, the relationship between the two was fractured and hostile. Neither the wendigo nor the Silent One wanted this symbiotic relationship, but Fate is rarely inclined to offer a true choice. As time has moved on, they have developed a respect for each other, moving from animosity to the kinship of pack siblings.<br/><br/>They no longer interact much with the Cult, preferring their own company. While they answer to Rasputina, it is a strained relationship compared to the rest of the Silent Ones. Storm's nature has driven Snow more towards independence, and she is more willful as a result. For now, the two are joined with the Cult's cause.<br/><br/>&mdash;description from the publisher<br/><br/>",

He devoured books on the arcane and soon proved to be a powerful user of magic in his own right, but his peaceful life of learning came to a violent halt the day that the Guild arrested his master for undermining their authority. Sandeep took up his Master&rsquo;s cursed Gada that day and unleashed the fury of Banasuva for the first time.<br/><br/>Sandeep was personally asked to come to Malifaux by Viktor Ramos in order to help train a new generation of Arcanists in the ways of magic. He holds his classes in secret, instilling in his students a respect for the arcane which he wishes he had on that fateful day back in India. He is an excellent teacher, and Ramos has been pleased with the progress of his students.<br/><br/>The locations of his classes frequently move, staying one step ahead of the Guild. In quiet moments of reflection and meditation, Sandeep often regrets the need for violence and wishes for a peaceful, quiet environment where his students could grow and prosper. He knows the tyranny and cruelty of the Guild all too well, and constant vigilance prevents him from dwelling on his own dark past.<br/><br/>Sandeep&rsquo;s box set contains six models, including Sandeep himself. Kudra, Sandeep&rsquo;s loyal student, is his right-hand-woman, and she defends her teacher with arcane skill and physical prowess. Sandeep can summon his Totem, Banasuva, to present a large, flaming threat for his opponent. Finally, the Poison Gamin are versatile Minions which Sandeep is also capable of summoning.<br/><br/>&mdash;description from the publisher<br/><br/>",

        "description": "Saxtorpsloppet (&quot;The Saxtorp Race&quot;) is a motorcycle racing and betting game from Swedish publisher Alga. It is one of Alga's first games ever.<br/><br/>It has an unusual mechanic since one person handles all six motorcycles and an infinite number of participants can take part and place bets. (It is also possible to be only sex players, each with one motorcycle and in that case it is a normal racing game.)<br/><br/>The game consists of six small wooden motorcycles (with drivers), each mounted on a small sheet of carton, some playing card-size pieces to lay out as the track, and the rules. The track pieces have numbers on both sides, 1 to 6 in different random orders.<br/><br/>When playing the track pieces is laid out in a straight fashion in a random order (which makes the number of possible tracks very high) and one playing piece (motorcycle) is choosen to start. That piece will, when placed on the side of the first track piece, point towards one of the sex numbers (digits) and that motorcycle is then moved along the first. Now the second motorcycle will point towards a number, and so a third motorcycle is moved forward (pointing to a number). And so it goes on.<br/><br/>Eventually one of the already moved motorcycles will be moved a track piece ahead and point to another number on that track piece. In a few moves' time all six motorcycles will be engaged in the race, &quot;promoting&quot; another (or ocassionally itself) to further pieces on the track. Winner is the playing piece (motorcycle) that reaches the last track piece first. The track pieces are double-sided so the race takes place along 24 track sections.<br/><br/>",

Players may not place their stones onto intersections on area that is enclosed by their opponent. In order for a stone formation to enclose area, the stone formation must be able to have imagined a string with the shape of a polygon connecting the centers of all of its stones so that each center is connected by the string to exactly two other centers of adjacent enclosing formation stones, and that string must divide the toroid into exactly two regions so that it is not possible to move from one region to the other without going through the string. Of these two regions of the toroid that are divided by the string, the one that is enclosed is the one which has a combined value of the measures of the angles of its side (its side being at all points adjacent to the string), that is smaller than that of the other region. Players may pass their turn without placing a stone, if both players pass this way consecutively, the game ends, and the winner is the player who has the most empty intersections enclosed.<br/><br/>",

The object of the game is to capture the opponent's four Vital Element pieces.<br/><br/>Each player starts with four different Vital Element pieces (circle, triangle, rectangle, square) on their back rank and six identical Warrior pieces on their second rank. On their turn each player moves one of their Warriors one square, or one of their Vital Elements up to two squares. They can capture an opposing piece by landing on its square, although a Vital Element cannot capture an opposing Vital Element unless it is the same shape.<br/><br/>When a player captures a Vital Element they may make a special bonus move, such as teleporting a piece across the board or resurrecting a captured Warrior, according to what shape of Element was captured. If a player captures all four opposing Vital Elements they win the game.<br/><br/>",

Question cards are associated with one of the 17 SDGs and provide 2 possible answers (A/B). The correct answer is listed on the back of the card with an explanation.<br/><br/>Two game modes are available:<br/><br/>     Achieve them all (2-4 players)<br/>     The great debate (5-10 players)<br/><br/><br/>Two additional &quot;animation&quot; modes are described:<br/><br/>     General assembly (10-70 people)<br/>     Facilitation (any group events)<br/><br/><br/>In the &quot;achieve them all&quot; game mode, each player takes a turn answering as many questions about SDGs as they want. They receive each card they answered correctly, but the card is only saved once the player decides to stop. Whenever a player gives a wrong answer, all is/her unsaved cards are discarded and his/her turn ends. The next player then takes his/her turn. The first player to collect cards for all 17 SDGs wins the game.<br/><br/>In the &quot;great debate&quot; game mode, 2 players (debaters A and B) are picked to argue for 30 seconds in favour of answer A or B. Other players (deciders) then vote on which answer is correct. The debater who got the most votes keeps the card (counts as 1 point). Deciders who found the right answer score 1 point. The game ends after a set number of turns.<br/><br/>&mdash;user summary<br/><br/>",

        "description": "Game-of-6 is an abstract strategy game for two players that can be played on a grid paper sheet, using pens of two different colors. (it's an evolution of classic Connect6). Rules:<br/>1. The player that opens the game places one dot of his/her color in a cell. In all the following moves, each player places consecutevely two dots in any empty cell of the grid.<br/>2. A player that aligns (horizontally, vertically or diagonally) six (or more) of his/her dots wins the game.<br/>3. Each time a player completes a closed polygonal with his/her marks, all the internal cells take that color. A closed polygonal is any closed path connecting dots of the same color, each adjacent horizontally, vertically or diagonally to next one<br/>4. The grid cells, once colored, are blocked. They cannot change their color even when they are enclosed in a new polygonal of the opposite color and do not take part to any alignment of dots. If a move generates both a closed polygonal and a winning alignment, the latter is prevailing and the game is over.<br/>4.2. A player turn is made of two separate moves: if the first one closes a polygonal, the internal cells must be colored before the second move is performed.<br/>4.3. A player can always enlarge an existing polygonal by adding new dots <br/>5. A player that colors six (or more) cells wins the game. It's not necessary that the six cells are enclosed by the same polygonal: the winning number can be made adding up spatially separated colored cells.<br/>When the game is over, the winner gains six points and the loser one point for each cell he/she was able to color.<br/>A match is composed by six games, to be started alternately by the players. The winner of the match is the player with the most game victories, and in case of a tie, the one who scored the most points.<br/><br/>",

        "description": "Game introduction:<br/><br/>Orion Cluster is a space wargame in which each player explores and colonises stellar systems and wages war on aliens with other players as opportunity and his skill allow.  The board was designed with seven players in mind, but more or fewer can be accommodated easily.  The spaceships used are severely limited in range and must frequently be serviced in order to remain operational.  Consequently base location dominates considerations of strategy.<br/><br/>User summary:<br/><br/>Orion Cluster was designed for long-duration postal play (play-by-mail) and uses a referee to execute planned player turns; it derives several concepts from Diplomacy.<br/><br/>The game board is made up of a hex grid measuring 17 hexes across and 18 hexes down, references by a letter/number system.  In play, the grid is toroidal (movement off one edge enters the opposite edge)  Forty-two hexes are identified as containing numbered stellar systems.<br/><br/>Turns comprise one half year of operations and primarily are focused on moving units on the grid and spending economic points, which accumulate based on how many star systems are controlled.  Units include Fleet, Coloniser, Fort, Transmitter, and Base types.  Movement is considered simultaneous; turns which end with opposing units in the same hex are resolved by combat with results primarily determined by superior unit numbers (some randomization is used in certain situations).<br/><br/>Alliances between players may be formed and violated at each players' discretion.  A player wins the game by controlling 60% of the entire economic value of the game at the end of any turn.<br/><br/>Orion Cluster was written by Lewis Pulsipher and published in Chimaera (Issue 54 - Jun 1979).<br/><br/>",

You have 200* characters on board, insane and hilarious, some of them explicit. The idea is that all of the players are part of a social network for Alter Egos, where everybody can be whoever they want to be. However, there is a catch - you don't know what your profile image looks like, so when you describe your Alter Ego story it will probably sound crazy and a lot more fun to all other players (because they can see your profile image).<br/><br/>When presenting your Alter Ego story be creative, present your &quot;self&quot; in the most fun way you can and tell everybody what kind of person you are looking for. Then all other players will choose a card from their hands and will suggest a match to your Alter Ego story. You will be the one to choose your friend, soulmate, drinking buddy, partner in crime or a date!<br/><br/>The main objective of the game is to collect as much winning tokens as you can. The one with most tokens wins the game, because more people have liked his or her Alter Egos.<br/><br/>Wait! You can win the game instantly even in the first turn!<br/>Each card has a different colored symbol at the top left corner. Each card has a perfect match card with the same color symbol somewhere in the deck.<br/>When the cards are presented to the Alter Ego and he picks the winning card, if this card has a symbol matching the symbol of the Alter Ego's card, the owner of the selected card wins the game automatically. No matter which round of the game it is!<br/><br/>*We have designed 180 characters, the other 20 will be suggested by our backers. We will choose the best ones and will include them in the game!<br/><br/>",

        "description": "Game introduction:<br/><br/>Fantastic Quest is a game for two players, one acting as the &quot;evil&quot; guardians of a treasure, the other as a group of heroes and wizards seeking this treasure (the &quot;explorers&quot;).  Both players record the location of their forces on a square grid (such as graph paper), using paper and pencil.  The explorer player searches the area by moving and calling out the position of his men, and by using magic spells.<br/><br/>The guardian, with limited ability to move, attempts to kill the searchers or at least prevent them for as long as possible from finding the treasure.  When an exploring hero or wizard occupies the same square as a guardian monster, a die is rolled to determine which is killed.<br/><br/>Turns alternate until the treasure is captured or, rarely, all explorers are dead.  Usually two games will be played at the same time, with players alternating roles, and the winner of the match will be the first player to succeed in his explorer role.<br/><br/>Including set-up time, one play lasts no more than half an hour.<br/><br/>User summary:<br/><br/>The board is a simple 10 x 10 grid with rows enumerated by letters A - J and columns enumerated with numbers 1 - 10.  The board is not actually used as a play surface, and each player may maintain their own annotated grid.  Turns are played simultaneously, with each player secretly noting moves and then openly executing them in a determined order of precedence.  Most &quot;units&quot; move and occasionally engage in conflict with opposing units - however, wizard units may cast a variety of spells that perform specific, unique functions.  A few of the guardian units also have special abilities.<br/><br/>The explorer player wins by finding the treasure and moving a unit to it; the guardian player wins by destroying the explorer's units.  If two simultaneous games are played, the player who first finds and reaches the opponent's treasure wins both games.<br/><br/>The game includes a few optional rules that complicate play but allow for more unit flexibility.  A method also is presented that allows for play without dice by combining random numbers selected by each player - this method also is suitable for postal play (play-by-mail).<br/><br/>Fantastic Quest was written by Lewis Pulsipher and published in Chimaera (Issue 73 - Mar 1981).<br/><br/>",

Each race has already spread across three star systems and is currently poised to continue its expansion into the remaining neutral systems.<br/><br/>Movement is simultaneous and hidden.  A [referee] is needed to run the game.  Each turn players will receive reports on the occupants of any hex in which the player has units or systems.  Builds of new units are ordered at the same time as moves, but occur before moves.  Units may be used on the same turn they are built.<br/><br/>User summary:<br/><br/>The board is a hex-shaped grid of offset squares, measuring 13 x 13 at the widest and tallest.  Players start around the edge of the board with vacant/neutral systems concentrated in the center, forcing play to proceed inward and leading rapidly to conflict.  The initial setup is known to all players.<br/><br/>One player wins by gaining control of a majority of neutral systems.  However, each game has an unknown, randomly determined turn limit (13 - 17) which usually occurs before complete player victory - the leading player at the end of the last turn is declared the winner; ties are possible.  Each turn provides a number of points for unit building based upon the number of systems under control.  The game presents a wide variety of unit types, selectable by the owning player and limited by cost.<br/><br/>The game was designed for short-duration postal play (play-by-mail) and requires a referee to execute the programmed player turns.

The player sitting to the left of the dealer may now begin to trade. He asks a player who has an animal half that he wants to own, whether he gives it to him, and which card he wants instead of him. The interviewee is now allowed to trade with another player. If someone does not want to trade anymore, because he can not get anything suitable, his left neighbor can continue. It is exchanged until nobody wants to exchange more. The aim of the game is not to collect the animal halves, but to invent as fantastic as possible new species of animals. At the end it will be decided who has put together the most beautiful animal and which name it should receive.<br/>3. Of course, you can also set up new adventurous species on your own.

Depending on the variation, this could be the name at the top and/or one or more events.<br/><br/>The other players in turn submit one of their cards face down, aiming to have the date at its top as close as possible to the mean date of the card read. The player who submits the card closest to the target card's date collects all the cards, and players who were off by more than 100 years pay an extra penalty card. If everyone misses by 100 years or more, the card's reader collects them all. The winner of the game is generally the first to accumulate 20 cards in hand.<br/><br/>One variation involves an additional set of &quot;group cards&quot;, which show the four individuals in each of the ten groups. In this version, one player acts as &quot;umpire&quot; who keeps the deck reads to the group the mean date and three events of one card at a time. The rest of the players, using the &quot;group cards&quot;, write down a name they believe closest in time to the mean date. The closest guess wins all the cards named from the deck.<br/><br/>",

        "description": "This is a &quot;Authors&quot;-style set collection card game, but featuring vegetable and mineral (but not animal) products from countries around the world. The deck consists of 58 cards: 13 sets of four, one set of five (&quot;the Prize Book&quot;) and a &quot;Double Prize Card&quot; with a map of the United States showing all the locations in the country where featured goods are produced.<br/><br/>This prize card is placed face up on the table. Each of the players is then dealt a hand of four cards. In turn, a player asks for a particular card from one other player; if that player holds it, it must be handed over, and the caller plays again. As soon as a call fails, the calling player draws one card from the deck, and the turn passes.<br/><br/>Winning is based on points. Each &quot;book&quot; of four cards completes counts one. The five-card Prize Book counts two. And whichever player has completed the largest number of books claims the Double Prize Card for two extra points. Note that this makes the Prize Book the key to winning if the holder is tied for the most books.<br/><br/>The 14 commodities are: Coffee (the Prize Book); Tea; Cotton; Rice; Wheat; Flax; Sugar; Silver; Gold; Iron; Coal; Silk; Copper; and Corn.<br/><br/>",

        "description": "Stickball is primarily an urban game. It's still around today, but with the advent of computer games and other distractions, it doubtless exists in fewer locations. It&rsquo;s played with a wooden broomstick &ndash;- minus the broom part &ndash;- usually taped at one end to provide grip. Sometimes the shaft of a shovel, hoe or similar hardware-store implement is used, which makes a thicker, heavier bat. The only other item needed to play is a ball. In my youth stickball was played with many types of balls &ndash;- tennis balls, &ldquo;pinky&rdquo; balls, &ldquo;pimple&rdquo; balls, &ldquo;pimple-star&rdquo; balls and sponge balls. Sponges lasted the longest.<br/><br/>Then there was the field, which could be anywhere. Most of the time it was a place with a wall where no one lived. A schoolyard was usually the best location, but not always. A box was chalked onto the wall representing the strike zone. If a pitch hit inside the line or on it, a strike was called. Due to his vantage point the pitcher often called balls and strikes, and arguments were common. A fly ball or liner that went different distances yielded singles, doubles, triples and home runs. There were no bases to run. Baserunners were simply tracked inside everyone&rsquo;s heads. Foul territory was decided beforehand.<br/><br/>Any number of kids can play stickball, but it&rsquo;s usually two or three per side. In the driveways of city blocks a white, hollow plastic ball with a hemisphere of slots was commonly used, to prevent broken windows. Neighbors still complained, though, when it rattled their windows during dinner hour. In this version balls and strikes weren&rsquo;t called. You got one swing per at-bat (and could wait for &quot;your&quot; pitch), although it typically took two fouls to make an out. Two to four players would commonly face each other in &ldquo;backyard&rdquo; stickball.<br/><br/>In Big Time Stickball, two players face each other in a streamlined version of the pastime. Nine innings are played just as in baseball, with the players alternating in the roles of pitcher and batter.<br/><br/>First, the pitcher chooses one of five pitches to throw: fastball, curve, screwball, riser or sinker. Then the batter tries to anticipate what the pitch will be, and commits his swing to it. He can choose to swing normally or for the fences. A card is drawn from the game's 70 result cards, and the pitch and swing cross-checked to determine the result of the at-bat.<br/><br/>If the batter correctly anticipates the pitch he has a great chance of a hit. Conversely, if the batter looks for a riser and the pitcher throws a sinker, his chances for a hit are slim and his strikeout chances are greater. An optional rule allows the batter to &quot;take&quot; pitches and try for a walk. House rules are easy to implement, enabling players to customize the game as they wish. Batter up!<br/><br/>",

        "description": "Z Gate Crashers is a 1 to 5 player monster hunting adventure (card game), where the goal is to survive an onslaught of invading monsters. Using various combinations of weapons and bonuses, players try to dispatch the monsters.<br/>You and up to 4 friends are a band of mercenary monster hunters. Your job is to contain the evil abominations that come crawling out of large filthy stinking holes in the ground.<br/><br/>You and your team are deployed behind protective energy units called GATEs.<br/>These GATEs are powered by a new energy source that&rsquo;s harvested from killing the nasty monsters, called Soulbits.<br/>Soulbits are your lifeblood and your currency. You use them to keep your GATE energized, and you protected from attack.<br/>You can also trade in the soulbits you earn, for more weapons and bonus cards, to help you defeat even more nasties.<br/><br/>The object is simple, you&rsquo;ve got to survive.<br/>But more than mere survive, a successful GATEr needs to thrive by harvesting as many soulbits as possible.<br/>The Player with the most soulbits at the end of the game wins.<br/><br/>The game ends when either all of the players or all of the monsters are dead.<br/><br/>Monsters are distributed in Wave cards, that show the different types, distributions, and amounts of each invading wave of monsters.<br/>During their turn, each player draws a wave card, and using monster cards and monster-life tokens, they line each up to create the monster attack track.<br/><br/>Monsters typically emerge at the hole and during initiative, take a varied number of steps to get closer to the gate and do damage.<br/><br/>The player (typically) has first-attack initiative. Using acquired weapons and bonus cards, in various stacked, chained, offensive, and defensive combinations; the player tries to kill as many nasties as possible and collect those soulbits.<br/><br/>The monsters next get their move and attack actions, using initiative tokens.<br/>An initiative token is placed under the monster card that will next act.<br/>The initiative token (typically) moves sequentially down the track (and back around), with monsters getting 4 such actions in a &ldquo;Normal Difficulty&rdquo; game. The location and move-direction of the initiative token along the monster track can be altered based on certain Wave Cards.<br/><br/>When a monster card has initiative, all monsters on that card get to move (one step closer to the gate) and then if able, attack. <br/>All monsters attack when at the gate but do so in a variety of different ways and with differing effects.<br/>The player rolls to save against an attacking monster. A successful roll gains the player a bonus soulbit, but a failed roll will incur (sometimes cumulative) damage to the gate. <br/>During initiative, some monsters also get a bonus attack that they take regardless of their distance from the gate.<br/><br/>If a player survives, play moves on to the next player to see how they do.<br/>A recovery session is granted at the end of each round, allowing players a chance to buy more loot, recover from various effects, and trade with other players.<br/><br/>Game difficulty and experience are controlled in the distribution of wave cards, allowing for highly dynamic and varied gameplay.<br/>When wave cards run out, play continues in the same order until either all players or all monsters are dead.<br/>The player with the most soulbits, at the end, wins!<br/><br/>&mdash;description from the designer<br/><br/>",

        "description": "Demolition Derby was written by Bob Chapman and published in Chimaera (Issue 14 - Mar 1976).  The game was designed for postal play (play-by-mail) and supports eight players and one game master.  Subsequent issues of the periodical included play reports.<br/><br/>Each player controls a single car designated by color (White, Yellow, Orange, Red, Green, Blue, Purple, Black).  The demolition derby is part demolition and part traditional race.  The play board depicts an oval track divided into five racing lanes (A-E) and twenty-six racing zones (1-26), allowing for 130 distinct track locations.  One zone is traversed each turn for each 10 M.P.H. of speed.  Each turn (top and bottom) runs six racing zones with variable, denoted bank (which limits safe speed); each straightaway (left and right) runs for seven racing zones.  Cars may be in the same zone as long as they are not in adjacent lanes.<br/><br/>Each car has a determined number of &quot;wear&quot; points (damage) and a speed in 10 M.P.H. increments.  Each turn consists of players issuing written orders for their car (intended acceleration, positive or negative; intended lane change; and attempts to baulk, shunt, or spin an opponent).  The game referee then executes the turns' orders using an &quot;order of precedence&quot; for the cars which rotates each turn, following a pre-randomized pattern.<br/><br/>As a further randomization, a deck of forty &quot;tactics&quot; cards was dealt at the start of each race, each player holding five cards.  These could be played on any turn.  Cards bearing +1, +2, +3, and +4 allowed additional acceleration (in 10 M.P.H. increments) on the turn they are played; the &quot;Superb Driving&quot; card allowed a turn to be safely navigated at any speed.<br/><br/>The game was intended to be played with one postal turn per week.  A typical, complete race took approximately two years (abt. 100 turns) - though deliberately combative driving could significantly shorten this by player elimination.  Cars that did not receive orders were assumed to follow their lane at a constant speed (with appropriate results).<br/><br/>-User summary<br/><br/>",

        "description": "Investorboss! was written by Ian McLaren and published in Chimaera (Issue 15 - Apr 1976).  This simple game was designed for postal play (play-by-mail) and cannot be converted to face-to-face play because turns require one week of real time.  At least two players are needed, though the game may facilitate any number of players (8 players is considered optimum).  At the start of the game, one player is selected as the &quot;investment manager&quot; and this player will execute all of the turns and make a report of results (including their own).  The game runs for a number of weeks (turns) determined at the start of play.<br/><br/>The game is run by selecting any newspaper published at least once a week that carries at least some financial news and stock listings (the author suggests the &quot;Financial Times&quot; as appropriate).  All players begin with a &pound;100,000 loan taken at interest.  Players submit one turn per week in writing, containing a buy/sell order or orders.  Players may buy or sell any number of shares they can afford in any stock, bond, or security that is routinely reported in the selected newspaper.  Players may also repay a loan, in whole or in part, if desired.<br/><br/>The &quot;investment manager&quot; player calculates a trade expense using a standard (given) formula depending on the type of security, and then adjusts the player's portfolio as appropriate.  On the weekly mark, the newspaper issue of that day is used to determine the net value of all player holdings (including appreciation, depreciation, and dividends).  The loan rate for outstanding loans is deducted, and players that are &quot;in the hole&quot; are forced to take overdrafts at higher loan rates (loan interest rates are fixed by the rules).  The &quot;investment manager&quot; player then makes a report to all players.<br/><br/>After the determined number of week (turns) has elapsed, all shares in any security are sold, all costs are calculated and deducted, all loans are repaid (if possible), and a final valuation is made for all players.  The player with the highest monetary value is declared the winner.<br/><br/>",

        "description": "THIRD REICH: THE CARD GAME is a historical game of World War II designed by John Prados that uses cards and can be played between two to four players. Each player controls a side or a Front in this multifaceted game, seeking to defeat the opponent by winning the most Battlefield cards before the end of play. There are no dice, tokens, counters or anything but cards in this game.<br/><br/>Force and Unit Cards<br/><br/>These cards represent military forces of various nations in the war. The Basic Game contains a selection of Axis and Allied divisions and corps and armies for the Soviet.  An illustration shows the type of troops, or a typical combat action, a unit insignia, or other distinctive element. The card often has brief comments on the actual unit. It will show a combat value.  Certain unit types have special abilities in the game.  In general, battles will be resolved based on the CVs of the Army Cards on both sides of the action. The player draws cards from a pile called the Mobilization Deck, holds them in her/his hand, and then deploys them to locations on the tabletop.  ,.<br/><br/>Support Cards<br/><br/>These cards represent important Leaders in the war, key command Headquarters, and Air Force units. Support cards by themselves have no Combat Value. Instead, they add their printed CV to other Army Cards present with them. This support value is shown by brackets printed around the card&rsquo;s CV. If alone on a Battlefield when the opponent attacks, Support Cards&mdash;excepting Air Force units&mdash;are eliminated. Air Force unit cards immediately fly to another Battlefield on the same Front where friendly cards are present. If unable to meet that condition, Air Force cards are eliminated.<br/><br/>Special Cards<br/><br/>Special Cards come in many varieties and have particular functions. The capture of Battlefield Cards is the player&rsquo;s main goal in the game. Battlefield Cards provide locations for combat, create a timeline for the war, and award Victory Points to the player who captures them. They are specific to one of three geographic Fronts in the game.  Event Cards add to the play and can upset the best of plans; they are self-explanatory. Fuel Cards represent economic resources and shape the actions the player can conduct in his turn. Battle Condition Cards set characteristics for a fight in progress.<br/><br/>The Board<br/><br/>The Board can be a game mat or any tabletop as a geographic space divided into three main areas called Fronts. The Fronts occupy the center of the space between the players and collectively are termed the Combat Zone. At each player&rsquo;s edge of the table, she/he will require three spaces. One of these is for the player&rsquo;s Mobilization Deck, which consists of all unplayed cards. One is the Discard Pile of cards that have been expended. The third is for the player&rsquo;s Strategic Reserve, which comprises cards the player has put into play but not yet deployed to a specific Battlefield.<br/><br/>",

El Chapo&rsquo;s team is constantly moving around inside Mexico trying to evade the law, but the cartel leader has certain tastes and expectations. He&rsquo;s not just willing to sit inside a hole somewhere and is interested in leading an active, social lifestyle. Law enforcement has to use that against him.<br/><br/>The key to the game is the facilitator. It&rsquo;s their responsibility to keep the game moving by interpreting the rules and feeding them to players on the fly. But in Kingpin, the facilitator also plays the role of referee.

        "description": "Found in Too Fat Lardie's Summer 2011 Special magazine.<br/><br/>This is a set of rules that attempts to simulate the actions fought by coastal patrol craft from the English Channel to the Pacific Ocean. Most of the actions involved small craft armed with automatic weapons and torpedoes attacking other patrolling coastal forces as well as supply convoys and small war ships. Most of the actions took place under the cover of darkness since stealth and surprise were vital to the survival of these small craft.<br/><br/>This is not a game for large capital ships or huge fleets. The game is designed to allow each player to assume the command of a handful of small boats in order to refight the type of actions that were typical of the coastal action fought throughout the war.<br/><br/>Ideally these rules are used with 1/600th or 1/1200th scale models. Any Naval game will come with a whole host of data for the ships and vessels involved, and this set is no different.<br/><br/>To keep this piece to a manageable size the publisher has deposited all such data in the Files section of the TooFatLardies Yahoo Group.<br/><br/>",

You can attempt to complete your deck by trading cards with other Phreakers. They may be kind and donate to your cause willfully. You both may consent to a fair trade. Ideally, you will both desire to battle in The Stream for the card(s) you need. Winner takes the spoils.<br/><br/>Why does a complete deck matter? Look at the back of the deck. Do you see it? The art...it's incomplete. Complete the art, find the puzzles and capture the flags.<br/><br/>Inspiration<br/>The game Phreaker was inspired to provide the CypherCon 3.0 attendees a fun set of puzzles, with the option to have something they can continue using and collecting long after CypherCon 3.0 has ended. A byproduct of the game's inspiration is to use all proceeds from the sale of decks at the Midwest Gaming Classic and other conferences to support the Hak4Kidz NFP charity.<br/><br/>Many hours, people, and scrapped ideas went into creating what we hope dials you up into the exciting world of phreaking and hacking that was the two decades from 1970 to 1990.<br/><br/>Time to get your phreak on.

        "description": "Family friendly 2 player baseball game that uses a dueling dice rolling system. Draft your team, set your line up and outwit your opponent in this fast-paced 2 player game.<br/><br/>Each player will take turns drafting players from a pool of 30 character cards, until they have filled their team. Each team will draft 9 batters and 3 pitchers each in any order they choose. You will need to set your lineup for your batters 1-9 and decide on which pitcher you will use to start the game.<br/><br/>Each game is only 3 innings long. This is to keep the games shorter, kid friendly and gets you quicker into the next game. (We suggest you pitch a new pitcher each inning however, in advanced games you can play a full 9 inning game. In those cases it's suggested you pitch a new pitcher every 3 innings)<br/><br/>All players have a special power that can be activated when they roll a Crush/Dominate on their die roll while batting/pitching. This power often gives that character a huge advantage during that at bat to succeeded or in the pitchers case to get the batter out.<br/><br/>Pitching &amp; Hitting <br/>Once you set your lineup and selected your pitcher, the game starts. Home team will pitch first and the visiting team will bat first. The goal of the pitcher is to get the batter out, either by strike out or through the contact deck in which the batter can hit into an out. The batters goal is to make contact with the pitch and draw from the contact deck to get a hit. Each player will pick one of the 3 colored dice that stand for each of the types of pitches in the game. The dice have numbers ranging from 1-5 and 1 CRIT Side. Both players pick 1 die to roll and then roll at the same time, then check the results. The Pitcher gets a +1 to their die roll if the batter did not match the pitchers colored die. This is for not guessing the right pitch in the at bat. However if the batter does match the pitch color they would receive the +1 to their die roll. If the batter meets or exceeds the pitchers roll they make contact with the ball and draws a single card from the hit deck. If the Pitcher exceeds the batters die roll the batter receives 1 strike. On 3 strikes the batter is out. If either player rolls the CRIT Side, that character activates their own power. It's often a hit for the batter and a strike for the Pitcher automatically but with card manipulation along with it.<br/><br/>The Hit Deck has 50 cards and it's filled with automatic hits like: Home Runs, Triples, Doubles and Singles. There are also Contact Play Cards where it's hit out into the field and the pitchers team must successfully make a play on the ball or the batter gets a hit. Not to forget the dreaded automatic outs as well as foul balls. Many special powers allow you to draw multiple cards from the contact deck to give you the best chance at getting on base.<br/><br/>Game components:<br/>30 Beautifully designed players, 24 Hitters with 6 Pitchers.<br/>50 Card Hit Deck.<br/>6 Colored Dice Pitching &amp; Hitting: Fastball, Curveball &amp; Changeup.<br/>2 Standard D6 for Fielding.<br/>10x10 Playmat.<br/><br/>-description from designer<br/><br/>",

It is designed for use with P.T. Dockyard 1/600 resin miniatures. The tactics used in these operations were much different from standard naval tactics. Actions took place at point blank range (many MTB captains kept grenades handy on the bridge for ready use) and were often measured in minutes.<br/><br/>The focus is primarily in the European Theatre, but the rules are equally useful for actions between PT boats and the Japanese Navy.<br/><br/>In addition to the rules and miniatures, you will need an area at least 6' by 4', a metric tape measure, turn radius circles, and at least 2-4 each of 4 sided (d4), six sided (d6), eight sided (d8), ten sided (d10), twelve sided (d12), and twenty sided (d20) dice as well as making a few simple templates as described in the rules.<br/><br/>",

The only escape way was fleeing to the hills and several citizens made it, and more others were captured by the pirates and put in slavery in Berberia.<br/><br/>Will you manage to avoid the sack of the city and save its inhabitants?<br/><br/>Or will you sack the city and gain reputation among the Pirates?<br/><br/>The game consists of 24 colourful units to be cut and glued, 18 nice cards, a gourgeous map to be printed on A3 folio and the English   rules.<br/><br/>&mdash;description from the publisher<br/><br/>",

        "description": "Do you remember the seventies of the previous century? In those days, world politics were a simple thing. There were two superpowers, who lurked at each other in deep distrust and emphasized their ideological contrasts, and a third one, who stood aside with no emotions.<br/><br/>Nevertheless, World War III was never a real option. But both the USA and the USSR were always keen to harm each other in the Third World, and to drag every dingle despot to the &quot;right&quot; side. Both giants wanted to have governments of their favor everywhere in charge as long as possible -- in order to draw out as much as possible of there wealth of all these countries...<br/><br/>In this two-player card game, players use a set of action cards to win control and influence in countries around the world. Yellow &quot;China Chips&quot; play a special neutralizing role. The aim is to win the most money by winning the sympathies of the other countries.<br/><br/>This game was self published by Franz Benno-Delonge years before Twilight Struggle. When Twilight Struggle appeared with such immense (and deserved) support, Benno-Delonge produced a few more copies of 1975 for those interested in another approach at this interesting time period in world politics.<br/><br/>&mdash;user summary<br/><br/>",

Unfortunately, the stories are true, and you find yourself trapped in a parallel dimension.<br/><br/>Joined by other unfortunate adventurers, none of you remembers when you arrived, but you have a strange sense of D&eacute;j&agrave; vu. Have you done this before?<br/><br/>A giant stone obelisk stands before you, etched with various unusual symbols. You have a feeling that the secret to your escape hides beneath the ocean waves...<br/><br/>Each round consists of three phases: (1) rotate the &quot;first player&quot; card to the next role, (2) remove timer cards from all decks, and then (3) each role completes their turn in order.<br/><br/>Turns consist of each role taking 3 actions. Players work together to explore the triangle and remember the 91 symbols on the bottom of the ocean tiles.  There are 2 symbols per ocean tile. The appropriate symbols must be remembered and secured by player pawns to lock-in the escape pillars in the corners of the board.<br/><br/>There are 91 symbol cards with 10 symbols per card, and each symbol is represented in the deck 10 times so that each card has exactly one symbol that matches when paired.  That one symbol is available at each pillar to lock in for a limited number of rounds.  If not locked in it is replaced by another symbol or if no more are available, players are trapped forever within the Bermuda triangle.<br/><br/>Components:<br/>91 Symbol Cards<br/>46 Ocean Tiles<br/>18 Mysterious Pillar Tiles<br/>6 Role Cards (Bonus: several customizable role cards)<br/>6 Avatars<br/>4 Player Aid Cards<br/>3 Locked-in Pillar Markers<br/>1 Player One Card<br/><br/>",

Seven of these circles represent &quot;money cards&quot;, while the eighth is called the Poker Pool.<br/><br/>To begin a hand, each player puts a chip in each of the nine circles; the dealer antes two chips in each. The dealer then passes out the full deck to the players, adding an extra dummy hand. If the dealer's hand contains no &quot;money cards&quot;, he may exchange it for the dummy; otherwise, he may auction the dummy, with the winner paying the dealer and replacing his own hand with the dummy.<br/><br/>The player to the left of the dealer starts by placing his lowest card in any suit in front of him. Whoever holds the next highest card in that suit then plays, and so on until the Ace of that suit is played. A player who is able to play a money card in its normal sequence collects that pot.<br/><br/>Whoever plays the ace in a suit then leads his lowest card of a suit of an opposite color. Whenever players reach a gap caused by one of the missing cards in the dummy hand, whoever played last leads his lowest card in an opposite-colored suit. The first player to get rid of all his cards then collects the money in the central pot plus, from each other player, one chip for each remaining card held.<br/><br/>The hands end with each player putting together a poker hand from his cards, with the highest poker hand winning the Poker pot. All chips still on the board remain there as players ante for the next round.<br/><br/>The back of the game board provides a second game called Lucky Roll. It is played with 3D6, and players bet on either a total result from 3-18, or on a single number coming up at least once, twice or on all three dice. Whichever player acts as banker pays off the winners and keeps the remaining bets.<br/><br/>&mdash;user summary<br/><br/>",

Use your experience to customize your character and be the first to become the skydiving master.<br/><br/>Players will simultaneously reveal what position they will fall in. Will you perform a dive for high points? Be careful, if you focus on the ground you may crack under the pressure. Will you fall in style to impress on-lookers? Or have you already cracked and started Boxing to slow yourself down?<br/><br/>After players positions have been revealed they will now simultaneously reveal at which velocity they will fall. High Speeds bring great reward and high risk, where slower speeds will dampen your risk, but bring in less reward.<br/><br/>After all velocity choices have been revealed roll the corresponding dice starting with those who chose to move at the slowest velocities. All players who chose the same velocities will share in the same roll, but how they mitigate the roll may be different based on which positions they decided to fall in.<br/><br/>Collect the most points by increasing your risk, but be careful, if you don't deploy your parachute in time, you may lose it all.

        "description": "Cesare Borgia. We are in the Renaissance period in Italy. You are a hired hand of Cesare Borgia, the fearsome Commander of the Papal troops, and son of Pope Alexander VI. The Borgia clan gained power due to bribery, murder and intrigue which resulted in a lot of enemies. To keep them under the thumb, more bribery, murder and intrigue is required. All these actions are, of course, performed in the interests of the Holy Church and to protect the salvation of the poor Christian souls.<br/>Religion is not your concern. You&rsquo;re hired for the money.<br/><br/>Cesare Borgia a board game of skills management and determination for 2-5 players set in the Renaissance period in Italy.<br/><br/>GAME IDEA:<br/>Players try to perform missions in Italy and move therefore from city to city. To perform the missions, players require a mix of different skills: sabotage, theft, assassin and intrigue, represented by colored tokens. Money can be useful to acquire missing skills. Finally, to move, travel tokens are required.<br/><br/>On your turn, you draw 2 tiles out of a bag and place them on the corresponded grid. The purpose is to form series of similar tiles. When this is done, you can exchange the tiles for tokens. With the right tokens, you can move and perform the missions in order to gain victory points (VP).<br/><br/>GAME SET-UP:<br/>Place the game-board in the middle of the table.<br/>Each player gets a player board. Select one randomly or choose one. Make the choice by common agreement. Each player places his player board in front of him.<br/>Each player gets 6 tokens, one in each color. Three tokens are selected and placed on space 1 of the player board. The other three form a reserve and are placed on space 0. Each player takes his Heroic Exploit card which is placed next to the player board.<br/>Each player places the pawn of his color in Rome<br/>Shuffle the Mission cards and pile them in a facedown stack next to the game-board. Draw a first Mission card and place it face-up on Firenze (city n&deg;1). Then, draw a second Mission card and place it on Napoli (city n&deg;2). Draw a 3rd and 4th Mission card and place it respectively on Siena (city n&deg;3) and Ravenna (city n&deg;4).<br/>Put all the tiles in the cloth bag.<br/>Shuffle the Event and Upgrade cards separately and pile them in 2 facedown stacks next to the game-board.<br/>Place the Reference sheet next to the game-board. Keep the tokens and markers in a reserve aside of the game-board.<br/>Select a Start player randomly, which starts playing his turn.<br/><br/>HOW TO PLAY?<br/>Starting with the Start player, each player completes his turn in clockwise order.<br/><br/>A turn consists of:<br/><br/>drawing and placing tiles<br/>scoring lines<br/>exchanging tokens<br/>moving around the map<br/>executing a mission.<br/><br/>You can mix up all these actions and perform them in any order. However, after executing a mission, your turn is immediately finished.<br/><br/>EVENTS:<br/>Some mission cards mention &ldquo;Event&rdquo;. After placing a new Mission card, the player at the left of the active player draws an Event card and places it face-up upon an available Mission of his choice. Place the card in this way that all important info remains visible.<br/><br/>Events mostly make the achievement of the missions more difficult by increasing the number of required tokens. Sometimes events yield an extra reward. In this case, keep the card among your fulfilled mission cards as a reminder. Other events are discarded when the corresponding mission is fulfilled.<br/><br/>Some events show the roadblock icon. In this case, place or displace the roadblock marker on a path leading from one city to another. A path with a roadblock marker cannot be used. There is only one roadblock marker which must always be displaced, once it is put in the game. Discard the Event card after placing or displacing the roadblock.<br/><br/>When the stack of Event cards is depleted, shuffle all discarded cards again and form a new Event stack.<br/><br/>END OF THE GAME:<br/>The game is nearly finished when a player has reached or exceeded a certain number of victory points. Finish the ongoing round in order to give each player the same number of playing turns:<br/><br/>Two players: 12 victory points required<br/>Three players: 11 victory points required<br/>Four players: 10 victory points required<br/>Five players: 9 victory points required<br/><br/>The winner of the game is the player who has the most victory points. Occasionally, check the following tie-breakers in descending order: number of fulfilled missions, number of upgrades in hand, number of yellow tokens in stock or number of other tokens in stock.<br/><br/>-description from the publisher's website<br/><br/>",

        "description": "Gameplay revolves around a central play area called &ldquo;The Kingdom.&rdquo; At any given time, the kingdom may be filled with rich natural resources ripe for the taking; however, vicious, marauding monsters also roam the kingdom, bringing even more chaos to the tumultuous landscape.<br/><br/>Catch the Eye of the King!<br/><br/>Much to the benefit of the many lords and ladies vying for the throne, a contact within the castle keeps them apprised of the king&rsquo;s current state-of-mind. This is represented by the yellow &ldquo;whims&rdquo; cards. There&rsquo;s always a whim in play, ensuring that the lords and ladies have a definite goal to accomplish, but King Rolphius, the Jester-King, the Fickle, the Whimsical, is aptly named. The king&rsquo;s whims change constantly, and the courtiers must be ready to adjust their goals and tactics at a moment&rsquo;s notice.<br/><br/>While some of the king&rsquo;s whims are fulfilled by the use of shrewd planning and cunning gameplay, others rely on a distinctly different set of skills...<br/><br/>Gather Your Allies!<br/><br/>Because taking over lands and combating monsters can be dirty, dangerous work, the lords and ladies of the kingdom rely upon their houses&rsquo; faithful followers to do their bidding. These &ldquo;units,&rdquo; as we call them, are sent forth to bring glory and attention to their lord or lady. Each turn, the lords and ladies draw cards from the player deck in hopes of recruiting the right kind of unit for the job at hand. Since a unit can only interact with other cards of the same color, the lords and ladies must exhibit much cunning when ordering their units about.<br/><br/>Since the turmoil in the kingdom has caused the lords and ladies to become a bit more territorial, it has also become important for the courtiers to carefully guard their lands. That&rsquo;s why all lords and ladies are wise to assign some of their bold units as guards. You wouldn&rsquo;t want anyone making off with that nice little piece of forest, would you?<br/><br/>Units, at least those with the mettle to do so, can also venture forth to do battle with the menagerie of prowling monsters that roam the kingdom...<br/><br/>In Whims, units are used for multiple purposes. As the kingdom is explored and new lands appear, enterprising units can claim territory for their lord or lady. If things in the kingdom begin to feel a bit too chummy (or a particular lord or lady feels particularly churlish), units can also be used to attack enemy guards and capture the lands of opposing courtiers.<br/><br/>Send Forth the Hordes!<br/><br/>In Whims, monsters defeated by plucky units are captured and become part of the lord or lady&rsquo;s &ldquo;horde.&rdquo; Each type of monster has a special knack for mischief, and throughout the course of the game, the lords and ladies will send their hordes forth to cause mayhem to inconvenience and hamper their opponents. Much different from standard units, the monsters in a lord or lady&rsquo;s horde add a new layer of strategy and chaos to the game.<br/><br/>Simple, Engaging Gameplay<br/><br/>We feel that you should spend more time playing a game than referring to a rulebook, so Whims gameplay revolves around simple, intuitive mechanics.<br/><br/>Each turn, a player plays up to two cards from a hand of four.  These cards, usually units like peasants, soldiers, and knights, offer several interesting gameplay choices. As mentioned above, players can use their units to capture land from the kingdom, battle monsters, assault enemy units, or capture unguarded land from opponents. Interactions between cards are simply resolved by comparing colors (there are four of them) and numbers.<br/><br/>The game also includes some special units whose abilities affect the game in other ways, adding depth and surprise to the game.<br/><br/>Additionally, during a player&rsquo;s turn, he or she can choose to discard a monster or monsters from his or her horde to activate their abilities.<br/><br/>Certain cards, like the Shield, can be played out-of-turn.  These cards allow cunning (or mean-spirited) players to throw surprise wrenches into their opponents&rsquo; plans.<br/><br/>&mdash;description from the publisher<br/><br/>",

        "description": "The blockchain (also known as &quot;the trust protocol&quot;) is a technology that aims at decentralization as a security measure. It is &quot;an open, distributed ledger that can record transactions between two parties efficiently and verifiably and permanently&quot;. For use as a distributed ledger, a blockchain is typically managed by a peer-to-peer network collectively adhering to a protocol for inter-node communication and validating new blocks. Once recorded, the data in any given block cannot be altered retroactively without the alteration of all subsequent blocks, which requires collusion of the network majority.<br/><br/>In BlockChain: The Dice Game, players will use cards to represent fundamental processes for calculating and validating a BlockChain block. Cards, for example, allow you to move dice from the stack (main dice queue) to its board; or increment or decrement one of the dice you are using. Each block has a value to be validated, where subsequent blocks have values ​related to the previous blocks.<br/><br/>In some situations, players will use the cards to participate in the validation of a block made by another player. To do this, they needed to spend part of their tokens (representing the cost of processing that data) and became part of the validation pool of that block. One of the most common examples is the use of the PUSH card, where the player can &quot;push&quot; his dice to the board of another player.<br/><br/>For each block validated, players are given tokens for validating the block or for having helped validate it. At the end of the fourth block validation, the player with the most tokens wins the game.<br/><br/>&mdash;description from the publisher<br/><br/>",

The deck also contains six multicolored cards from 1-6.<br/><br/>After the cards are dealt out, the first player in the game lays down one or more cards; if they play more than one card, then the cards must be all the same color and they must either match in number or be in sequential order. The next player can play something higher than what was played initially with higher numbers outranking lower ones, and red outranking yellow, which outranks blue. A multicolor card played first on its own is worse than blue; played after a single card, it's considered to be the same color as what it's following.<br/><br/>The 1s can be played on 6s without needing to play more cards to outrank the current hand, so a blue 1 beats a red 6.<br/><br/>On a turn, a player either plays or passes. Once everyone passes, the last player to have played leads something new, and play continues until someone empties their hand of cards, thereby scoring points equal to what other players still have in hand. These rounds are repeated until someone scores at least 50 points.<br/><br/>",

There are easy and intermediate questions, so every member will be able to participate and learn something new. Players can even get rich by building up their own game farm while learning about the bush. Animal Kingdom was developed to get families and friends to interact and to show everyone how wonderful African wildlife is and how important it is for us to preserve and nurture what we have.<br/><br/>Players move along several intersecting tracks on a map of Africa, taking actions depending on which type of location they land on. Various actions spots allow player to answer trivia questions about African wildlife, gain or lose money (themed as various types of wildlife for their own game farm), or encounter unexpected events. The interior of Africa holds several off-road paths which are high risk roads that may lead to disaster or to riches. As players correctly answer certain questions, they earn pieces for their individual jigsaw puzzle. The first to complete his or her puzzle wins the game.<br/><br/>Wildlife trivia includes not only traditional question formats, but also tracking cards (with pawprints and other spoor that must be identified) and picture cards.<br/><br/>",

        "description": "Introduction:<br/>Quest for Esmeralda is a strategy-based, Simultaneous Action Selection battle game with medieval theme. Players each take a role as an adventurer on a quest to retrieve the treasure called Esmeralda. It&rsquo;s every man for himself, and players must defeat everyone else before reaching Esmeralda. However, Esmeralda is heavily guarded by the Dragon... How will you defeat all opponents, slain the Dragon and retrieve Esmeralda?<br/><br/>Gameplay:<br/>Each player is dealt a hand from a small deck of 12 cards. The deck is designed to be exhaustive, and players can deduce what other players have, based on what's been played.<br/>Players battle each other in multiple Battles, each consisting of Turns. <br/>At the beginning of every Turn, each player secretly chooses an action and their target. All cards are revealed at once, and the actions are resolved accordingly. If you accumulate enough damage, you are out for that Battle and cannot join until the next Battle. Don't worry, Battles typically only last 3 Turns.<br/>After every turn, surviving players get to move their pawn down the world map towards Esmeralda. Each point on the map, however, has a location card which may be beneficial or detrimental to the players. The last point on the world map is Esmeralda, defended by the Dragon. When fighting the Dragon, his health never heals. This means that sneaky players can swoop in and deal the last hit to win the game!<br/><br/>Frequently Asked Questions:<br/><br/>Is this a player elimination game?<br/>Yes, however the elimination is temporary. Players always come back to life after every Battle. It's no fun when players get eliminated and they have to sit around for the rest of the game!<br/><br/>Will it be hard for losing players to win the game?<br/>Nope! The game is designed for quick battles with balancing mechanisms everywhere.<br/><br/>What will I need to play the PnP version?<br/>You will need 4 pairs of matching pawns, and 1 unique pawn.<br/><br/>",

The game takes heavy inspiration from the Space Race and every rocket, card and patch is steeped with history.<br/><br/>Players take turns testing one of their systems, while the other players try to play Fail cards to damage the system and can keep it from passing. Players, however, can repair their own systems mid-test by playing OK cards, based on Mission Control Officers and Engineers. The first player to have all 4 of his or her systems survive testing, completes a rocket, earns a Mission Patch and ends the round.<br/><br/>Players can collect Mission Patches along the way for various in-game achievements (including completing a Rocket) and the player with the most patches at the end of 3 rounds wins the game! Mission Patches are used as a scoring mechanism as well as granting special rules to the players that hold them, creating a dynamic system that adds an ever-shifting asymmetrical gameplay landscape, keeping players on their toes and deepening the strategy further.<br/><br/><br/>",

The game shifts the focus from collecting many cards to collecting the right cards at the right time for deck optimization.  Every time you shuffle your deck you will bring your deck size down to the your current limit keep your deck dedicated to the actions you care about. Players need to choose the cards they take from the Tunnel carefully if they want to load the final gem into a cart and score a point.<br/><br/>Micro Miners is played like many deck builders and can be played  by taking turns gaining cards and using them to score points.  However in Micro Miners each player starts their turn with 3 Effort which allows them to take actions.  They can spend a number of effort indicated to acquire an available card from the tunnel or use it to play a Cart in front of them.  It can also be used to load gems into any suitable cart in play controlled by any player, but any player can block the gem from being loaded if they have a gem that matches the targeted cart.<br/><br/>Players have a hand limit size of just 2 cards and will draw a new hand at the the end of each turn.  If they ever need to draw cards but their draw pile does not have enough they will shuffle their discard pile to form a new draw deck.  Each time they do this they will count the number of cards in their deck, not including any carts in play or gems loaded into them, and will choose which cards to discard down to their deck limit.  All discarded cards will be Tossed face down into the Shaft.<br/><br/>The first player to score 3 points will win this micro deckbuilder.<br/><br/>Plays in 20-30 minutes.<br/><br/>",

The base has a circuit selector, wire connector with a metal tip that is touched to spots on the board and red light that allows or hinders the player's progress; underneath the base is a place for a battery to be installed to power the light.<br/><br/>Each game has a trail going over the points of interest and the player reaching the goal first wins the game.<br/><br/>After the traveler and opponent are decided, the traveler spins the spinner to determine how many steps to travel along the trail. The traveler determines whether to continue his trip by placing the contact tip on the station. If the light signal goes on, he continues traveling, otherwise he places his Disney character on the station as a marker and remains there and waits for his next turn<br/><br/>The opponent can confuse and obstruct the traveler by operating the rotary switch occasionally, to change the circuit so that the signal light will not light up and delay the traveler's progress.<br/><br/>If a traveler is not careful and picks the trail up wrong and heads back towards the starting point, he loses all previous plays and starts his travel all over again.  The winner of the game is the first traveler reaching the goal<br/><br/>Game consists of 4 playing boards in full color (Fantasyland, Tomorrowland, Frontierland, &amp; Adventureland), 4 character players, spinner, electric circuit complete with flashlight-type battery (Requires 1 D battery for the light).<br/><br/>Produced sometime in the 1950s<br/><br/>",

Players simultaneously use some or all of their cards to create one babel each. A babel is a shorthand form of a word or phrase. (The idea is reminiscent of the game Inklings.) Then, players take turns guessing one another&rsquo;s babels. Both the babeler and the first correct guesser receive the same score, which is the number of letters in the babel&rsquo;s meaning. For example, GDR, meaning German Democratic Republic, is worth 24 points. 3 GD LYR, meaning &ldquo;three good liars,&rdquo; is worth 14 points. Play an agreed-upon number of rounds.<br/><br/>",

The objective is to end the game with the most stones or markers of the player's color. The uncertainty principle demonstrated by game play is that a player may choose the location of their next move but not the type of piece played.  To play, players take turns designating a square they wish to occupy and rolling a die to determine if their color or that of their opponent is placed.<br/><br/>Additionally, players may place their marker on a square that is surrounded by enough of their color to &quot;convert&quot; spaces without rolling. An empty square adjacent both diagonally and orthogonally to three spaces of one color is in a &quot;critical state&quot; and if a fourth piece is placed adjacent, automatically converts to that color.<br/><br/>Successfully placing a piece may allow a series of neighboring spaces to be claimed. Strategy and risk are combined as players attempt to shape the board in their favor, while at risk of seeing their opponent benefit instead.<br/><br/>&mdash;description from the designer<br/><br/>",

When requesting a card from an opponent, players must specify both the family name and the number of the card. For example, a player might request the third card from the &eacute;clairs family (the &eacute;clairs with three symbols on it). If the opponent has that card, they must give it to the player.<br/><br/>As long as the player gets the cards they asks for, they can continue. For each new card, they request a card from the opponent of their choice.<br/><br/>However, if the player does not get the requested card, their turn is over.<br/><br/>The opponent who did not have the requested card becomes the new active player. Play continues until all families have been assembled.<br/><br/>For a two player game:<br/>Distribute 10 cards to each player. The remaining cards constitute a stack on the table. If your opponent does not have the card you want, you draw a card from the stack.<br/><br/>",

Two players each set up 52 different circular paper markers representing different military units and officers. Different types of units can move and fire in different patterns around them. Each turn a player can move or attack with up to five units and five officers.<br/><br/>Combat is deterministic based on the combat power of different units in close combat or when firing at enemy units at a distance. If one side is strong enough in a battle an attacked unit can be either eliminated or captured. If an attack is not strong enough the difference in combat power is recorded, per unit type, so that the next battle against a unit of the same time becomes easier. The remaining strength of individual units are not tracked, only an abstract counter per type of unit.<br/><br/>Units in a player's capital city, located at two opposite sides of the board, can be covered and moved without revealing its type to the other player, providing some fog of war and introducing some uncertainty into the otherwise deterministic combats. Each player is allowed to have 10 covered units or officers.<br/><br/>A player wins by eliminating the highest ranked officer of the other player, the king.<br/><br/>&mdash;user summmary<br/><br/>",

Unfortunately, they don't have the best organizational skills and a lot of random junk is mixed in with their super hero gear. But there's no time to make excuses or search for the perfect gear. All they can do is use the first thing they grab to save the day.<br/><br/>The Ultimate Adventures of The ULTIMATE ALLIANCE, is a fun, semi-co-operative card game for 3+ players. Where each player takes on the role of a Super Hero in an attempt to save the town from the latest threat. Each round the &quot;Mayor&quot; or judge creates a villain by drawing a Villain card, and then powers them up with 2 &quot;Bad-er&quot; cards (enhancement cards that make the bad guy bad-er), and a location card to set the scene.<br/><br/>Players then each receive a gear card, some helpful some not, and must come up with a plan to defeat the villain. Each player then pitches their idea to the Mayor, who picks which hero to hire based off of their plans. The winning hero receives points based off of the threat level of the Bad-er cards (1-3). Heroes also have the option of teaming up with other players and their gear to win and split the points, or push their luck and go solo and claim them all for themselves. The Mayor role then rotates each round.<br/><br/>The game ends at a preset point limit, decided before the game starts. The player with the most points wins!<br/><br/>Based off of the characters and world of The ULTIMATE ALLIANCE comic books by JH Comics. The game doesn't require any knowledge of the characters to play, but will provide some recognizable gear, bad guys and locations to fans of the comic.<br/><br/>-description from designer<br/><br/>",

Players look at their hands, and then <br/>pass two cards<br/> to the player on their left. The player <br/>on the dealer&rsquo;s left will lead the first trick.<br/><br/>Each Trick: <br/>Each trick is a party. To score points, <br/>you can try to be the fanciest person, or to be seen <br/>with someone much fancier than yourself.<br/><br/>Starting with the leader and proceeding to the left, <br/>each player plays one card face up. The card you play <br/>represents a party guest.<br/><br/>Important Rule: <br/>A guest can&rsquo;t appear twice at the same party. You may play a duplicate of a card that was already played, but it will be discarded, scoring no points.<br/><br/>Scoring the Trick: <br/>After each player has played (or discarded) a card, the trick is scored as follows:<br/><br/>The Center of Attention:<br/> The lowest card played is the most fabulous in the room. This card scores its face value for the player who played <br/>it. This player will also lead the next trick.<br/><br/>The Hangers-On: <br/>All other cards score points equal to the difference between themselves and <br/>the next-lowest card. For example, if the cards are 3-4-6-10, they score 3, 1, 2, and 4 points.<br/><br/>Discards: <br/>Copies of earlier cards are discarded. These score zero points.<br/><br/>After scoring, discard all the cards from this trick and play another, starting with the player who just played the lowest card. A full round is eight tricks, and a full game is one round for each player.<br/><br/>Game End:<br/>The game ends after each player has dealt one round.  Then, the player with the most points wins!<br/><br/>",

The 33-card deck includes lavish colour illustrations of the many vital uses of coal during WWII, especially in producing coal gas and plastics vital for the military.<br/><br/>While it is labelled as a &quot;Quartett&quot; game (Happy Families variant), it is designed to allow play of Schwarzer Peter (Old Maid variant) as well. For the former, 32 cards are divided into eight sets of four, and the player who collects the most sets wins. For the latter, the 33rd Kohlenklau card is added, and each set of four is divided into two pairs, one with red dots and the other with black dots. Players try to collect pairs while avoiding being stuck with the Kohlenklau card at the end of play.<br/><br/>The eight themes illustrated are: Coal for Fighting; Coal Plastics; Coal Extraction; Coal Processing; Coal Burning; Coal in Industry; Coal Conversion; and &quot;Wonders from Coal&quot;, other uses including medicines, propellants, dyes, candles and soap.<br/><br/>The game includes a calendar card showing the date 1944, with days of the week and dates correct for that year.<br/><br/>",

Each turn, you can choose to recruit players to your guild, purchase items from the auction house, challenge a raid, hunt a monstrous foe, participate in a PvP contest, or upgrade your guild hall. Your players are online only during certain times of day, and you have to balance when and how to use them together!<br/><br/>Raids include a press-your-luck element in which you have the chance to accrue a large amount of loot, reputation, and potentially, equipment, but only if you exit the raid before your party wipes! Monstrous foes are singular fights against powerful enemies that appear randomly. PvP allows you to wager on 2-on-2 battles between your guild members, and upgrading your guild hall provides various bonuses, not the least of which is increasing your maximum number of guild members!<br/><br/>The game ends after a certain number of turns. Can you accrue the most reputation to become the best guild on your server?<br/><br/>",

        "description": "The Concept<br/><br/>The game was originally conceived with standard playing cards in my book 52+ New Card Games. I designed 20 cards with famous artwork and added some bad art and a set of forgery cards. Money cards are also included for players to make bids.<br/><br/>The Game<br/><br/>Players begin by getting three Forgery Cards and then choosing one each. The chosen Forgery Cards are set aside until the end of the game. Each Forgery Card matches each of the Art Cards.<br/><br/>Eight Art Cards are then chosen randomly and players look at all of them before the game begins so that a strategy can be considered. The eight Art Cards are then shuffled and put into a pile called the Catalog. Each player then gets ten Money Cards.<br/><br/>Play is done in rounds. For each round, the top Art Card from the Catalog is revealed and players make an initial bid. Players can then increase their bids until a winner for the round is determined. Special Cards can also be played during the round. Rounds continue until each Art Card is revealed and bid upon.<br/><br/>The challenge of the game is to win high priced artworks without running out of money or taking in a forgery.<br/><br/>At the end of the game, the Forgery Cards are revealed and their matching Art Cards are eliminated. Players then count up the values of the Art Cards they possess. The player with the highest value of art is the winner.<br/><br/>&mdash;description from the designer<br/><br/>",

        "description": "In this 2P Sport &amp; Logistics game each player is the Owner/Manager of a minor league hockey team in 1972, skating together as bitter rivals in the Denver Coliseum. The western league is on the rise &amp; this contest could help put it on the map among HOCKEY's elite. However! In the same building: The Stock Show &amp; Rodeo is preparing to open AND the BULLS have all escaped in chaos &amp; are stampeding the rink. Manage your team &amp; crew to profit from this unique situation. The puck must drop, so there will be a winner-- but today there might be BULLS.<br/><br/>GOAL: Have the most $$ after 3 periods of hockey<br/><br/>Players compete on several fronts to put some $$ on the scoreboard by a variety of mechanisms:<br/><br/>AREA CONTROL: Use barricades to control the four quadrants of the hockey rink in order to manipulate the routing of BULLS.<br/><br/>ROLL &amp; MOVE: Each quadrant is subdivided into 16 sectors where actions may be selected by the end location of the erratic &amp; rapid transit of the PUCK token. The PUCK moves according to hockey actions, it can be moved by TIME CARDS &amp; PLAYER CARDS and it can travel by a strict P1/P2 roll &amp; move procedure.<br/><br/>SIMULATION: Players compete in statistically realistic head-to-head hockey combat based in an abstracted dice &amp; block war-game system. The puck-shaped timer cards provide situational responses as well acting as the &quot;clock&quot; for each period of hockey. Once the deck is depleted, the buzzer sounds.<br/><br/>STOCK HOLDING: Each barricade &amp; player card are shares of the team &amp; league value indexes represented by a 2-Axis 'tug of war' pawn index tracking the scaled value of each team's contribution to the night &amp; establishing current market prices for removing bulls &amp; scoring goals. The index is driven by the categorical accumulation of player actions. Judicious buy/sell strategies may be required.<br/><br/>HAND MANAGEMENT: Players must manage the multi-purpose TIMER CARDS &amp; HOCKEY PLAYER CARDS for more effective operations in each phase of play, as well as more control over deterministic mechanisms within the game.<br/><br/>CAN ALSO BE PLAYED SOLO VS. THE AUTOMATED CONSOLE<br/>NOTE: This speculative scenario is statistically &amp; historically plausible &amp; reflects accurately a confluence of scheduling in Denver, CO, January 1972.<br/><br/>",

Unforeseen instability splits their source code apart and two new programs emerge; one good and one evil. Will they be mankind&rsquo;s greatest strength or its destruction? Our fate is in their hands.<br/><br/>Get with the Program is a deduction game with a unique blind team mechanic for 4 to 8 players. You take on the role of an artificially intelligent robot vying for the fate of humanity. At the beginning of the game all players will work together to secretly assign each other in to two teams. Good robots and evil robots. Because this is done in secret no one knows what team they are on. The good robots want stability by decrypting robots with pure code. The evil robots want to sow instability by installing corrupt code.<br/><br/>Game play consists of two phases. During phase one players assign code cards to robot cards by placing code cards face down below robot cards. A robot&rsquo;s programming is complete when it has 3 code cards. These code cards determine which team that player is on. During phase two, players will be revealing code cards to discover which team the robots are on. As code cards are revealed they will score stability points. Two code cards of the same color will give one point to the blue team. If the code cards are different colors the Red team will score a point. Instead of a revealing a code card a player can place a tracking chip. If they are on the blue team they are trying to match a player to their robot card. Red players want robots to be guessed incorrectly. Play continues until one team has reached enough stability points to win the game.<br/><br/>",

The objective of this game is to have a blast building the systems of car audio legends using the cards in your hand, the cards you draw, or the cards you 'buy'. The challenge is to be the one at the end of the hand and ultimately, the end of the game, who has racked up the highest score. Scoring in this game is calculated by db (decibels) as measured in car audio competitions as the SPL (sound pressure level) of your system.<br/><br/>Suitable for children under 12 with adult assistance, and crazy fun for the whole family! Customize your fun by setting your own time, goal or scoring limits. Each Legend's card offers unique legendary abilities such as drawing 4 cards per turn instead of three, reducing the cost of buying class cards, or allowing you to fish cards from the discard pile.<br/><br/>Each player is dealt a hand of cards and can take a number of actions on their turn such as drawing cards from the draw deck and discard pile, buying a class card / legendary card to build on, buying a 2x amplifier card, building on a class, closing a class and ending a turn by discarding. As you move along in the game you add subwoofers and amplifiers to complete your system and close it out,gaining bonus points for each build you've completed. Once the draw deck runs out, players add up their points to see who is the champion.<br/><br/>Created by car audio guru Donald Hebig (dBDon) and his wife Ferne (Nerfblat), the world's first and only car audio card game is a great way to share a love for car audio with family and friends.<br/><br/>&mdash;description from the designer<br/><br/>",

Play every person for themselves, or divide into two even teams. To play cards into your/your team's bank that aren't already in play, you need to have a minimum of three of a kind or two with one wild card. Once a collection is started for a number in the bank, each player of your team that follows can add as many cards to the bank as they may have in their hand. For example, if your team could not yet collect queens because no one had laid any in the bank, and on your turn, you put three queens in the bank, the next player in your team to play, can add a single queen on top of that pile. Every card laid in your team's bank counts as points for your team, while every card remaining in your hand counts against your team at the end of the hand. The goal is to be the first team to get to 1600 points.<br/><br/>What's your playing style? Do you hold on to those high scoring cards, never discarding them? Do you play with risky strategy, only banking three of a kind when you actually have five? Will you end the round and catch the other team with handfuls of cards to count against them? This game can get as crazy and entertaining as you make it.<br/><br/>This deck of 162 cards (three unique and custom designed decks of 54 playing cards including Jokers) will allow play for 2-8 players. The instructive rule book is user friendly and easy to follow.<br/><br/>As a bonus, you can split the cards into three standards playing decks to use playing your other favorite card games!<br/><br/>",

This fold-out A3 board comes with rulebook, plastic playing pieces, 60 cards and even a bonus game on the back.

Players each get 2 actions per turn, which can be spent moving around the sewer base, fighting a zombie, scavenging for scraps, or crafting those scraps into survival tools.<br/><br/>Each player has a coloured pawn, which means they can attack any like-coloured tiles (so a red pawn can attack red tiles and so on), so some tactical manoeuvring is required to make the best use of fighting, scavenging and crafting.<br/><br/>Some turns, players will come across equipment which can be added to what they manage to craft. Other turns an unfortunate event will occur, which can see zombies gaining in number, or survivors being hindered.<br/><br/>When all players have used their actions, all zombies on the board move one space towards the base, then more spawn depending on how many turns have been taken. The more turns, the more zombies will spawn.<br/><br/>If a zombie reaches the base then the players have lost. If they make it through 20 turns then mop up any remaining zombies, then they have won.<br/><br/>NB: If you have a copy of ZomBN1: A Board Game All About Brighton, then you can use the components from that game to replace the standard plastic pieces with this.<br/><br/>&mdash;description from the publisher<br/><br/>",

        "description": "Konkvest is a chess-type board game specifically made to be played by two players. It is played on a hexagonal board with 142 tiles, as players alternate taking  their turns  to move  their pieces.  The tiles  are  distributed  in  13  rows,  the  middle  row  has  12  tiles  in  total  and  each subsequent row on the higher and the lower level has one tile less, ending with 6 tiles in the final rows. There are additional 28 tiles with specific use defined in the manual.<br/><br/>The game is intended to serve as an official chess in the fantasy world of Atharon. After its conception, the game took on a life of its own and, rather than remaining just a footnote and a mere mention in the world of Atharon, it became a fully-realized project.<br/><br/>Since its intention is to basically be Atharon chess, it's played similarly to the regular game of chess we all know. Players alternate turns moving their pieces across the board in accordance with the rules of movement. The rules of movement are too complicated to be described in text so they are explained in pictorial form in the rulebook.<br/><br/>The main goal is to win the game by beating the opponent by toppling his Queen. Alternative ways include capturing the opponent's base by placing one's Queen on the specific tile the opponent's Queen started off, which is easier said than done. Another alternative way to win the game is to force the opponent's timer to expire.<br/><br/>By standard a Konkvest game is timed using a 10 minute hourglass, which is balanced out at the start of the game so each player has 5 minutes at his disposal. Once set, the hourglass is laid horizontally. The player who makes the first move lifts the hourglass vertically and the time measurement begins. At that moment, the top chamber of the hourglass represents the time available to the second player. Once the second player makes his move, he flips the hourglass upside down so his chamber is at the bottom. Then it's the first player's turn again. The more one player spends on thinking, the less time he will have for future moves and the more time he will provide to his opponent, and vice versa. The player who's time runs out loses the game.<br/><br/>During his turn, a player can do one of the following things:<br/>1.) He can move one of his pieces according to the rules of movement on a different tile. If that piece ends its move within that player's promotional zone and hasn't captured an opponent piece, the player can promote that piece. If that piece ends its move on a tile occupied by an opponent's piece, the player takes that piece and adds it into his reserve pool, effectively capturing it. The only piece that cannot be captured is the Queen, once she's toppled the game is over.<br/>2.) He can pick up one of his pieces from his reserve pool and return it on the board as an active piece, strictly within the territory he currently controls.<br/><br/>At the end of his turn, the player flips the hourglass and then it's his opponent's turn to do the same procedure.<br/><br/>Konkvest is an abstract battle simulation, meaning all of its resources are limited. Players have a limited amount of pieces and a limited amount of movement, they have a limited amount of spots in their reserve pool and they have a limited amount of time to spend on making their move.<br/><br/>",

To win a Pharaohs soul you must deduce the value of one hidden card you own!

Each game takes 15 to 30 minutes to play.<br/><br/>GAME OVERVIEW<br/><br/>A game of AARU is played over 3 rounds and points are scored by winning tricks and by deducing and playing your Pharaoh card at the right time! Points can be lost if a Pharaoh is played incorrectly.<br/><br/>At the start of each round the players are dealt a hand of cards. All players pick a Pharaoh for the opponent to their left and add it to the opponents hand facing away from them.<br/><br/>In turn, players play a card from their hands with the highest value of the leading type played winning unless a Power card has beaten it. The twist is that in AARU whenever a player could have played their Pharaoh card (the one that faces away from them) the other Players say AARU to them to indicate they missed the chance of playing their Pharaoh. This way they can eventually deduce when is the best time to play their Pharaoh card for bonus points!<br/><br/>Points are totaled for each of the three rounds with the winner being declared by having the most points at the end.<br/><br/>",

        "description": "Contents:<br/><br/>4 Player figures &ndash; these are children, whose names you can imagine yourselves.<br/>1 Playing board, which represents a meadow with lots of colourful flowers, divided in 38 spaces.<br/>28 Animal tiles.<br/>1 six sided dice with the numbers 1, 2 and 3 (each number twice).<br/><br/>Goal of the game and game idea:<br/><br/>The children are playing at the flower meadow of the Mole. Other animals grow curious of their cheerful laughter and, as they begin to approach the flower meadow, are invited one after the other to join them. The meadow is small, though, and the children must consider which is the best way to distribute the space on it so that as many animals as possible can get a spot, or maybe even all 28!<br/><br/>Setup:<br/><br/><br/>     Distribute the player figures randomly on the playing board (2, 3 or 4 pieces, one per player).<br/>     Place the tile with the Mole on one of the corner spaces, and the rest of the tiles face up or face down beside the board.<br/><br/><br/>Note: it is suggested to play with 20 animal tiles on the first, introductory game. The rest of the tiles are then put back in the box and are not used in that game.<br/><br/>Gameplay:<br/><br/><br/>     The youngest kid begins. After rolling the dice, they move they player piece as many spaces on the meadow grid as the number rolled. They are allowed to move on any direction on the grid, but only forwards. That is, they can't turn or change direction midway.<br/>     If the player figure lands on a new space (not occupied), an animal tile is freely chosen and placed on the space the player just left when moving (on the first roll, the space from which the player started, and so on).<br/>     Going around the table, each player then does the same on their turn, bringing more and more animal tiles onto the board.<br/>     While moving, both other player pieces and occupied spaces can be jumped over, but they still count as spaces moved towards matching the total rolled on the dice.<br/>     As the game goes on, the available space for placing tiles becomes more and more scarce, and one can't land beside another player's figure!<br/>     If a player can't place a tile on their turn, they can move another player's figure instead of their own. To do so, though, they must ask the figure's owner for permission first.<br/>     The children are allowed to discuss and give advice to each other regarding where to best place the animal tiles. Nevertheless, the decision is always on the hands of the currently active player.<br/><br/><br/>Mainly through the rule that makes the players ask for permission to move another player's figure in case that they can't move their own, children are motivated to play fairly and respectfully, which ends up being of benefit to all players as a group.<br/><br/>End of the Game:<br/><br/>If the players manage to lay down all the animal tiles, they win. If they don't manage to do so, they lose.<br/><br/>For subsequent games, add or subtract one tile from the 20 tiles used in the introductory game, depending on whether you won or lost the last game respectively. For example, if the introductory game played using 20 tiles is lost, try with 19 tiles next time; if that game is won, try with 20 tiles again &ndash; if the introductory game is won, try with 21 tiles next time and work your way up to using all 28 animal tiles at once.<br/><br/>&mdash;description from the manual (translated)<br/><br/>",

For instance lots of Dutch soldiers who fought the German invasion were either deported directly as POW right after the war or &quot;arrested&quot; in the years after.<br/><br/>After the liberation a number of Dutch games were produced, based on events during WW-2.<br/><br/>This game is based upon that theme: going into hiding to prevent being caught by the German occupiers.<br/><br/>&mdash;user summary<br/><br/>",
