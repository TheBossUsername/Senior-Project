My guess would have been 1970s; listed as 1987 by a German Nuernberg game fair review.  Rules in French, Italian and German only!  Funagain claims to have an English translation.  I suspect the author is Marco Donadoni, who also created Zargo's Lords.<br/><br/>",

Suppose you're a starving little ant and some people come along and spread out a lot of mouth-watering snacks for their picnic. You'd really love to get a few but you know it's not going to be easy...<br/><br/>This is a children's (Ages 6 - 12) tile laying game where the players try to connect their ant tunnels to the goodies at the picnic (7x7 grid). They can also play tiles of &quot;baddies&quot; (bug spray, ant-eating spiders, human feet that squash ants, etc.) on the other player's tunnels causing them to go around or play a tile clearing the problem before they can go on. When all the goodies are eaten, the player who got the most wins.<br/><br/>Although simple (only 5 different tunnel patterns to choose from), no dice rolling or memory element helps young gamers develop and rely on their strategy skills instead of luck.<br/><br/>",

        "description": "Alea evangelii is  from the tafl family of games. The original name of the game is unknown. Alea evangelii is the first words of the twelfth-century Corpus Christ College manuscript 122, commonly known as Corpus Irish Gospels, which contains a description of the game. The game is believed to represent a naval battle and is played on a 18 x 18 game board. The description of the game states that it was invented at the court of King &AElig;thelstan of England (924&ndash;939).<br/><br/>Each of the four corners and borders of the diagram is assigned to one of the four Evangelists. 67 pieces are derived from the Eusebian Canons: each Canon defines a number of pieces corresponding to the square of its number of columns. Pieces defined by a specific canon are grouped together on the board: such groups are labeled by a cross and the number of the corresponding canon.<br/><br/>Four more pieces are painted in red (all the others are painted in black) and in the manuscript are mentioned as &quot;different men&quot; (varios viros): two of these four pieces are assigned to the Evangelist John (N14, F6), the other to Mark (N6, F14). The four &ldquo;different men&rdquo; are also labeled on the board as related to the passion of Christ.[8] One of the black pieces (E13) is referenced in the manuscript as &quot;the primary man&quot; and &quot;belongs to none of the evangelists&quot;; it represents &quot;the Unity of the Trinity&quot;, the one purpose of the four evangelists. Finally, &quot;the figure 1 in the middle of the alea signifies the indivisible substance of the Trinity, or the supremacy of the first canon&quot;.[6]<br/><br/>The 16 pieces of Canon I form the diamond at the center of the board. Canons II, III and IIII, together with the four &quot;different men&quot; and the &quot;primary man&quot;, form the circle surrounding the central diamond. Canons V, VI, VII, VIII, IX are organized horizontally along the lines of the board. The four pieces corresponding to each of the four Evangelists in Canon X are placed in the four quadrants of the board (C14, Q14, C6, Q6).<br/><br/>The manuscript mentions the existence of attackers and defenders, but the two sides are not differentiated on the diagram, which only presents the details of how the pieces are assigned to the four evangelists according to the Christian allegory which is the main subject of the text. In other tafl games the goal of the attacker is to capture the king and the goal of the defender is to make the king escape from the board, it has been assumed that this is the case also with the game on which the Alea Evangelii moralization was based.<br/><br/>Games of the tafl family only have two kinds of pieces: a king that occupies the center of the board in the initial layout and a number of ordinary pieces divided between attackers and defenders with a 2:1 ratio. The &quot;dukes and count&quot; that appear in Alea Evangelii do not seem to fit this simple scheme. It is tempting to suggest that on his travels, perhaps in Rome, Israel may have heard of the new game just beginning to circulate in Europe, chess, with its comites, milites, and other pieces, and borrowed the idea of different ranks from that game.<br/><br/>",

        "description": "Russian card game of attacking and getting rid of all cards. Originally a game for two, three or four players, it's mostly known today in an adapted version for two players brought into England by the Mathematics professor A.S. Besikovitch, and later included in David Parlett's Oxford Guide to Card Games. This version is played with exposed cards and symmetrical hands, giving it a strong strategic flavour.<br/><br/>At the beginning of the (Besikovitch) game each player chooses two sets without overlapping with the other player, typically in a 32-card deck, out of which one is their own trump. Cards are dealt for the first player, who keeps the cards of their both sets; the second player gets exactly the same cards in the other sets and both their hands are filled up with the rest of the cards. As an example: a player who's chosen spades and clubs with spades as trumps keeps the cards in both sets and gives all their red cards together with the undealt cards to the other player, who then selects the analog cards to the first player's in the red sets with hearts as trumps, gives the rest of the red cards back to the first player and finally keeps all the remaining black cards. Both hands are symmetrical, and play can start.<br/><br/>From now on each turn a player lays a card in a pile between both players; before the next player can play out a card of their choice they must throw one that is superior in value to the top card in the pile or a trump. If the player can't or doesn't want to do so they must take the whole pile and forfeit the turn. So, each player throws two cards in a row: one following the previous card, and one to be followed by the opponent. The first player to get rid of all cards in their hand is the winner.<br/><br/>",

The player then has ten seconds to study the picture on the card. When the timer runs out the card is passed to player two and player one rolls the die to see which question is to be asked. The questions are on the reverse of the picture card. Player Two checks the answer by looking at the picture and if it is correct the card is given back to Player One to keep. If the answer is wrong the card is placed back into the Brainbox and the next player chooses a card. Please remember, the answer to the question is on the picture side of the card, so look carefully! The player with the most cards after ten minutes wins! If there is a tie, it's sudden death with both players choosing a card and having to answer all eight questions on the card. The player who answers the most correctly wins! For 1 player Look at the card as above for ten seconds. Then turn the card over and answer all the questions (use a pen and paper to record the answers). If all questions are answered correctly the card is kept. If any answers are incorrect, the card has to be put back in the Brainbox. See how many cards you have after five or ten minutes.<br/><br/>",

Your goal is to find the city of New Eden before others players.<br/><br/>Each player will play a character with 8 characteristics: fighting, shooting, driving, chating and having mechanical, medical, discretion and foraging abilities.<br/><br/>Each turn, players choose one of the 5 possible destinations. On his way to the chosen destination, each player will make an encounter and most of the time a fight will result. But all encounters are not the same. Depending on your opponent you'll try to run away, to pay what he wants or to use one of your 8 characteristics to fight him. If you own a car you also can try to accelerate to evade. Your characteristic plus some items and a dice will decide if you succeed or not.<br/><br/>Depending on the place you've chosen different actions are possible: trying to hide to recover, collecting items, selling or buying items, fighting with other players or exchanging items in between players. Items are in your hand. You may use most of them but some have a cost you must pay to use them.<br/><br/>But in this post apocalyptic survival is not easy. Each turn you must eat and drink.  You can get wounded or contract diseases that players with good medical abilities can heal or cure. Players can also improve weapons, vehicles or armors using their technical abilities.<br/><br/>The first player to arrive at New Eden, one of the 5 destinations, wins. But the road to new Eden is more challenging: you'll face 5 encounters on your way. And before entering New Eden you must be free of any disease.<br/><br/>Two additional scenari are available, one with a mission to be accomplished before trying the road to New Eden, and one for a single player.<br/><br/>",

If there are no more cards to draw: take all the cards from the discards, from the market and from ALL the deposits, shuffle them and continue the game, repeat this operation until there is a winner.<br/><br/>GAME TURN<br/>Each player during his turn can only perform ONE action from the following:<br/><br/>- Draw a card from the deck showing it to everyone, if the card is a Robot-Component that you don't have, it must be placed in front of you<br/>going to train your Robot, otherwise if it is a Robot-Component you already own, it must be positioned in the market area.<br/>If you lose one or all of the components of your Robot, due to MINI ROBOT DEVASTATOR or BAND of MINI ROBOTS DEVASTATORI cards, you can continue with different components from the previous one, by fishing or buying them on the market at the cost of 3 BOLTS.<br/>The other cards: Bolt, Guard Robot, Mini Robot Devastator and Band of Mini Robots Devastators, must be positioned to the side of your Robot to form an area that we are going to call deposit, and played when you want, in a subsequent turn, when you decide not to draw a card or when you are attacked by an opponent.<br/>If you draw the DYNAMITE card it must be played immediately.<br/><br/>- Use one card from your warehouse: MINI ROBOT DEVASTATOR or BAND of MINI ROBOTS DEVASTATORI to distract the Robot from the opponents or three BOLT cards to purchase a ROBOT-COMPONENTS card from the market.<br/><br/>",

The players look for rare plants and animals at the corners of these tiles. There are four face-up animal or plant tiles which indicate which landscape types they must touch in order to be found there. Plants and animals, once found, are worth points.<br/>The players travel as gnomes via dragonfly, badger, bird and grasshopper. The landscape determines which tiles can be crossed with which type of transportation. Players can only use the same type of transportation again after they have used all four at least once.<br/><br/>",

It is full of everyday events from usual pirate life: battles, horror gigantic krakens and old maps. In the game you choose the character to play. It's one of the famous pirate leaders. Each of them has his own ability to help you get rich quickly.<br/><br/>Turn begins with the player opens the top card in the event deck and everyone gets involved in a new adventure, which usually ends with a grandiose sea battles. For example, when the card Trade Fleet comes to play all players may send the quantity of their ships they want to rob that trade ship. In case the raid was successful all players divide the loot among themselves. When the card of Royal Fleet is opened all ships of all players have to take part in this battle. But they also have two alternatives: 1) they may try to escape: 2) or they may buy off those royal ships. There are also places where players may renew their ships. Floating Tavern is such card. The current player rolls a die and adds received number to the modification indicated on the card. This sum indicates the quantity of pirates in the floating tavern. These pirates are the cheapest in the game. They cost just one coin per pirate.  After this the players start hidden auction to determine who will be the first in buying the pirates. For the hidden auction they use coins, it means who may buy more rum to the pirates. Most likely, not all players will be able to buy new pirates. The player who collects more victory points  represented with gold and ships becomes the winner.<br/><br/>",

You are a manager controlling the ring strategy of your fighter, balancing his punching power and offensive and defensive boxing abilities against those of his opponent. You can play two contemporary (1979) or all-time-great fighters creating many &quot;what-if?&quot; situations.<br/>This is not a long-winded, overly complex game but was in the vanguard of beer and pretzels games before the German games invasion. You should be able to read the rules and play your 1st bout within an hour. Advanced optional rules can be added later for more realistic flavor.<br/>Components are meager but complete. Included is a simulated boxing ring with 2 corners divided into sections for each fighter's stance of Aggressive/Counter/Defense. Also included are 2 realistic metal fighters (look great if you paint them), 2 Game charts, and a pad of score sheets, rulebook, 1D6, 20 Contemporary and 20 All-time-great fighter cards.<br/>A turn consists of simultaneously: 1) Secretly choosing your stance, 2) rolling on the &quot;Boxing ability vs. stance&quot; chart for any punches landed, 3) rolling for each landed punch on the &quot;Punching power vs. defense&quot; chart for results, 4) recording points and stats on the score sheet, 5) roll recovery if needed and repeat sequence 3x for each round.<br/>Advanced optional rules include Endurance, TKO, Injuries, Solitaire, Rope-a-dope, Haymakers, Clinching, Stuns, Head Butts, Tiring and everyone's favorite; &quot;add your own&quot; rule.<br/>This game has a real nice boxing feel to it and is remarkably easy to play, especially if you're not the bookkeeper statistician. If you are creative you can come up with modern fighter cards based on their stats.<br/><br/>",

The scoring pegs allow tracking scores from zero to 999.<br/><br/>To begin the game, players alternate putting one chip of their color into any of the 4 center holes of the board until all 4 holes are filled. The first player then puts one chip on the board so his chip traps one of his opponent's chips. Trapping is custodial, as in Hnefetafl or Othello/Reversi, in any of the eight directions from the just-placed chip. Once a player traps an opponent's chip, he turns it over to his own color. Players score 1 point for each chip in the new row which has been formed (including the just-played chip and the own-color cap chips). Players may trap multiple chips at once or chips in multiple rows.<br/><br/>Once a double chip is on the board, any row which contains it is worth double (for either player). If there are multiple double chips involved, they're added together before applying the multiplication (thus 3 double chips is sextuple score, 4 double chips is octuple score).<br/><br/>If an opponent turns over a player's stop chip, this prevents the trapped chips in that row from turning over and voids the opponent's score for that row.<br/><br/>The game ends when all holes on the board are filled. At the end of the game, each player adds one point for each chip of his color remaining on the board.<br/><br/>The player with the highest score wins.<br/><br/>",

The game is always different each time you play with four scenarios you can use depending on how much time you have and how many people are playing . . .<br/><br/>IT (tm) is the game where you design the monsterous [sic] &quot;IT&quot; war machine yourself; then try to take a planet with it . . .<br/><br/>* Trade mark for the Micro Science Fiction Games of ATTACK INTERNATIONAL, the creators of modern S.F. Wargaming, and the first to create Mini SF* games.     <br/><br/><br/>User Summary<br/><br/>IT is a small-format sci-fi wargame that may remind gamers of another asymmetrical conflict between a behemoth war machine and an array of lesser opposing forces. (See: Ogre.)<br/><br/>In this game, the opposing forces are faced off against IT, a sort of mega-tank or robot. The conventional forces must defend a planetary base from IT. The player controlling IT creates a customized war-machine design by allocating IT's 1000 mass/weight units. The variable characteristics include IT's speed, armor, weaponry, defensive systems, and (structural?) integrity.<br/><br/>Each game turn consists of the first player moving any or all his units, followed by that player's combat phase. The second player then executes his own movement and combat phases, completing the turn. Terrain affects movement and combat, with line of sight being a factor.<br/><br/>In addition to the standard IT versus conventional forces scenario, three additional scenarios are provided: a two-player conventional forces battle, a two-player IT versus IT battle, and a three-player battle royale where two of the players control an IT and the third player controls the conventional forces. Rules are also provided for a solitaire game in which the player controls IT against 20 random conventional force units that move and attack as determined by the game system.<br/><br/>Advanced rules variations allow for plotted simultaneous movement and/or combat. Additional optional rules provide for opportunity fire and a two-player &quot;Blind IT&quot; game. The blind game uses two mapsheets so that the IT player can only see units visible to IT. The rules helpfully note that the blind &quot;system only works with a conventional player who does not cheat.&quot;<br/><br/>Game Scale<br/><br/>Units = individual vehicles to small groups of combatants.<br/><br/>Hex and turn scales are not stated.<br/><br/>",

This grid affects movement and combat - doing away with tedious millimeter measurements and allows the player to focus on maneuvering his units and rolling the dice. Squares can be either open (no impediment to movement) or closed (terrain impedes movement).<br/><br/>Troops are organized into units, and graded according to type (close order foot, open order foot, close order mounted, etc), quality (elite, veteran, trained, levy), and armor. The basic system is for units roll a number of dice (number determined by the abilities of the unit) to hit, and defenders roll dice to save the hits (if they have armor). Each unit may have up to four &quot;hit points&quot;.<br/><br/>The rules are published in a 36 page binder, and contains army lists for Sumer to the Mognols. In addition to the usual rules for terrain, movement, and combat, C&amp;K distinguishes itself by adding rules for the &quot;setting&quot; of the battle, by including pre-battle effects such as seizing key features on the battlefield prior to the battle, ambushes, and losing troops prior to the battle for various reasons.<br/><br/>",

        "description": "Warfare among the Plains Indians was mainly for glory.  Through many skirmishes a warrior could gain prestige and advancement within his own tribe.  A coup (pronounced <br/>&quot;koo&quot;) was a brave deed or act done against one's live enemy: touching a live, fallen enemy, stealing a horse, etc.  Upon completing this brave act, the warrior would return to his own tribe to recount for them the full details of his glorious deed--counting coup.<br/><br/>The information in Count Coup has been organized in two ways.  First, four large ecological areas can be seen in the map on the box cover: Eastern Woodland, Great Plains, Desert West, and Far West.  The tribes appearing on the playing cards are placed in their approximate areas on the map.  The colored border on the cards corresponds to the ecological area of the tribe referred to.<br/><br/>Second, the playing cards can be divided into 14 categories: Food-Plants, Transport, Dwellings, Leadership, Tools, Crafts, Hunting, Warfare, Person-to-Know, Trade, Ceremonies, Treating Ills, Social Control, and Tragedy.  Four cards appear in each category, one from each ecological area.  More information can be found for each of the 56 playing cards in the corresponding Explanation Cards, garnered during the course of the game.  These latter cards may be read aloud for a greater understanding of the cultures during the course of the game, or not if a faster game is sought, but the victor must collect four to accompany the movement of his pawns from the Summer Camp to the Winter Camp.<br/><br/>Hazard and Reward Squares corresponding to the Eagle, the Buffalo, Irrigation, and Fire will be encountered in the journey.  If rewarded, the player attends the Pow Wow, where he is temporarily safe.  A coup is made by landing on another player's pawn.<br/><br/>",

        "description": "From the publisher's website:<br/><br/>The early years of the eighteenth century were a time of great, and long lasting, changes in Eastern Europe. It saw two former &lsquo;Great&rsquo; powers decline; for Sweden it was a cataclysmic experience as they were reduced to a small or medium power. While Poland-Lithuania started on the path that would lead to extinction later in the century. It saw two medium sized powers, Denmark and Saxony, fail in their bid to gain, or regain, &lsquo;Great&rsquo; powers status. It saw two powers rise; for Brandenburg-Prussia it was an important stepping stone to Great power status later in the century. While for Russia went from being &lsquo;an obscure barbarous nation&rsquo; to a Great power thanks to its victories<br/><br/>Polemos: Great Northern War is aimed at gaming large scale actions from this time. It is quite possible to stage, play and complete actions in an evening and even the largest action should be relatively easy to play. The emphasis is on the Great Northern War but other actions from this period can also be fought. The wars against the Ottoman Empire, the Polish Civil War and other actions in the period 1695 to 1725 may also be fought. You can be Peter the Great of Russia and face the cream of what was probably the best army in the world of this period &ndash; Charles XII Swedish army. Perhaps instead you could as Peter battle the Ottomans on the river Prut.<br/><br/>The Great Northern War has perhaps not been gamed as much as would be expected for such an important conflict with many interesting battles and armies. To a large extent this is because of the lack of information about the war and its battles. Polemos: GNW will introduce information and army lists that will rectify this. You too will be able to command the combined Saxon, Polish and Russian army at the battle of Kalisz (1706) or re-fight the Polish civil war battle of Koniecpol (1708).<br/><br/>",

The &quot;Robber Hotzenplotz&quot; from the well known book by Otfried Preu&szlig;ler, has stolen pieces from the grandmother`s cake and trying to get them safe in his hiding place. The players try to catch him and the pieces first.<br/>There are four figures walking along square fields, in which the board (looking like a landscape)is divided. The Hotzenplotz-figure is independent from a single player. It walks after all four players rolled their dice and walks along a spiral way from the outside to his hiding place, crossing the squares. He always walks to and fro, stealing another piece of cake and gets it to his hiding place.<br/>If he comes to a square with one of the four figures on it, he captures it. But if the players manage to place two figures on the square with the robber (otherwise it is forbidden to place two figures on one place!), then he is captured in prison and the piece of cake saved. Of course, the robber starts from the prison right away again to steal more ...<br/>There are different variants, making it easier or more difficult for the players to reach the goal of saving four pieces and winning the game together.<br/>Nice co-operative game for the youngest gamers, starting discussions after every dice-roll where the figures should walk.<br/><br/>",

The period covered runs from the late 1950&rsquo;s onwards, and allows also for the use of aircraft and helicopters.<br/><br/>An important aspect of the rules is that the units can start as unidentified &ldquo;blips&rdquo;, which might be dummies, and there is a simple detection and identification system that changes the status to &ldquo;contact&rdquo; (detected as an enemy vessel) and &ldquo;target&rdquo; where the model is deployed. If you can get out of radar &ldquo;sight&rdquo; then you can revert to &ldquo;blip&rdquo; status again.<br/><br/>The shooting system allows for guns and missiles of various types, and damage is recorded in a graded system with 5 states from intact to sunk. Vessels can take Special hits when damaged which further degrade their ability. There are simple rules for operating helicopters from ships, as well as rules for anti aircraft fire with guns and missiles.<br/><br/>There are also additional rules for unconventional craft, mine warfare and operations against coastal targets.<br/><br/>They are rounded off with extensive data tables for missiles, torpedoes, guns, rockets, SAM systems, Air to Air missiles, ships, helicopters and aircraft. (There are 140 sets of ship data from over 40 countries).<br/><br/>Summary of Contents<br/><br/>INTRODUCTION<br/><br/>SETTING THE SCENE: Vessel Descriptions; Command and Control; Play Area<br/><br/>TURN SEQUENCE AND INITIATIVE<br/><br/>MOVEMENT: Moving Astern; Turning; Collisions; Drifting; Grounding; Towing<br/><br/>TARGET DETECTION AND IDENTIFICATION: Detection / Identification States; Managing &ldquo;Blips&rdquo; and other markers;  Moving &ldquo;Blips&rdquo; and &ldquo;Contacts&rdquo;; Notes on Detection and Identification; Radar Detection; Detecting Radar Emissions; Sharing Detection Data; Visual Identification of the Target; Random Visibility; Sharing Identification Data; Starshells and Flares; Countermeasures<br/><br/>FIRING: Weapon Firing Arcs; Eligibility of Targets (Lines of Fire); Gunfire; Missile Fire; Torpedo Fire; Salvo Rocket Launchers and Rocket Pods<br/><br/>DAMAGE:  Basic Damage Table; Damage Control<br/><br/>AIRCRAFT AND HELICOPTERS:  Altitude; Aircraft and Helicopter Detection and Identification; Surface to Air and Air to Air Fire; Aircraft Damage; Air to Surface Attacks; Launching and Recovering Helicopters<br/><br/>UNCONVENTIONAL CRAFT: Semi Submersibles; Surface Effect Ships; Hydrofoils; Hovercraft; Ekranoplans; Suicide Craft<br/><br/>MINE WARFARE: Types of Mines; Hits on Minelayers; Mine Laying; Detonation; Minesweeping; Mine Hunting; Minesweeping Helicopters<br/><br/>LAND FORCES: Troops; Vehicles; Buildings; Use of Naval Weapons against land targets<br/><br/>TABLE OF ACRONYMS AND ABBREVIATIONS<br/><br/>DATA TABLES: Air to Air Missiles; Anti-Ship Missiles; Guns and Rocket launchers; SAM Systems; Special Craft; Torpedoes (Unguided); Torpedoes (Guided); Bomb Systems; Typical Helicopters; Typical Aircraft; Notes on Ship Data Tables<br/><br/>SHIP DATA TABLES<br/><br/><br/>",

The number depicted is the allowance to move as many knights (pawns) from the end of your chain to the front of it.<br/>Obstacles hinder a smooth movement, and you can capture opponents knights or even cut his knights-chain off !<br/>For all these actions you have to show the right movement card, some actions require 4 knights.<br/><br/>For the time edited (around 1950) a very good strategy game with much room for decision making what to do best with the random movement card. The beautifully designed gameboard adds to the atmosphere...<br/><br/>",

You decide how far to travel (up to your boat's max speed) on each turn, but you have to slow down if you're in the weeds or in a dock zone.<br/><br/>Travel around the water &quot;casting&quot; and &quot;flippin'&quot; fish, and make sure you have the right jig for the type of water you're fishing.  If you're &quot;flippin'&quot;, you can get right up next to a fish, but if you're casting, you have to stay a few spaces away and roll the die to see if you've caught it.  (Takes some initial strategy to make sure you have enough of the right jigs for the area you're planning to fish.)<br/><br/>And those fish are crafty - you might lose a rod or a lure or pull in a mermaid or old tire instead of a fish.

This is also a good way to progressively introduce players to more complex train games.<br/><br/>The game was created for a publishing contest launched on BGG by Chad Ellis ($1,000 Budget Design Contest: Get Published!).<br/>It requires submissions to fit in a ziplock format, using at most 5 5x7&quot; cards for the complete game.<br/><br/>This format requires a very streamlined rules set, so this game is not a true member of the 18xx family of train games, hence the 'pocket'. It does however bring a full featured train game on the table, with network building, locomotives evolution, and if the $tock Market Expansion is used, an alternance of stock rounds and operating rounds.<br/><br/>",

        "description": "Komm mit durch Deutschland! is a trivia game for children focusing on German cities and other places of interest. Players draw cards with towns, popular sights or landmarks from a number of cards placed next to the board. The place on the card should be very close to a neutral figure on the game board which is a map of Germany.<br/><br/>After that, the cards are turned and you can see where the places really are and the players put their figures on that place on the board. The player who has his figure closest to the neutral figure can answer a question to get closer to this figure. If he can't answer the question, the second player can answer the question and so on. After that, the closest players score points.<br/><br/>The game includes two maps of Germany: a more detailed map with cities and rivers on it, and another one without it.<br/><br/>",

If the player does not have a 4 or a Scurvy Sam, he must pick one card from the draw pile, unless he has a Crazy Nate 8. A player may discard a Crazy Nate 8 and change the suit to any suit of his choosing.

        "description": "Sparro is an adaptation of the game Captain's Mistress (think Connect Four) for the Series: Shibumi game platform. It differs from the original in that the goal is to be the first to get three in a row rather than four and the board wraps around the Shibumi pyramid. It is about as simple as it gets but has more depth than tic tac toe. Sparro is quick to play, has a surprise or two now and then, and is fun.<br/><br/>Sparro is played on the four faces of the three lower levels of the Shibumi pyramid. (There is no crow's nest.) To set up the board, create a 2x2 pyramid using five white marbles in the center of the 4x4 base. This pyramid will support the placing of marbles on the outer faces.<br/><br/>One player uses twelve red mistress marbles and the other uses twelve black pirate marbles.<br/><br/>Red starts and places a marble on any empty space. Players then take turns playing a marble on any empty space or 2x2 platform.<br/><br/>The first to get three in a row wins the sparring match. See the figure below for all the legal 3-in-a-rows on one face of the pyramid. If no one wins outright, Black wins. This compensates for Red having the initiative at the beginning of the game.<br/><br/>\t\t<br/>\t\t<br/>\t\t<br/>\t\t<br/>\t\t<br/>\t\t<br/>\t\t<br/>\t\t<br/>\t\t<br/><br/>Extended Play Variant<br/>The standard rules for Sparro apply but with the following three changes:<br/><br/>1)  Play continues until all 24 marbles have been played. The player with the most three-in-a-rows on the board at the end of the game wins. Note, when counting, count all unique three-in-a-rows. For example, four-in-a-row counts as two three-in-a-rows. Rows can intersect.<br/><br/>2) To resolve ties the following mechanism is used.  A tie-breaker token, for example a gold doubloon or a white marble, is given to Black at the start of the game. From then on, the token belongs to whichever player last created a 3-in-row on the game board. If there is a tie between players for number of three-in-a-rows, the possessor of the token wins.<br/><br/>3) On Black first turn, if Red played to a corner space, Black must play to one of the eight edge center spaces, or, if Red played to an edge center space, Black must play to one of the four corner spaces. Thereafter, there are no further restrictions on either player. (This rule is to prevent symmetric play and an automatic win for Black.)<br/><br/>Included in the Shibumi Rule Book<br/><br/>Soft cover:<br/><br/><a target='_blank' href=\"http://www.lulu.com/shop/cameron-browne-and-nestor-romeral-andres/shibumi-rule-book/paperback/product-18940123.html\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer noopener\">http://www.lulu.com/shop/cameron-browne-and-nestor-romeral-a...</a><br/><br/>Downloadable PDF:<br/><br/><a target='_blank' href=\"http://www.nestorgames.com/rulebooks/SHIBUMI_EN.pdf\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer noopener\">http://www.nestorgames.com/rulebooks/SHIBUMI_EN.pdf</a><br/><br/>",

        "description": "T&acirc;b is a traditional Egyptian abstract game played in a number of Arabic-speaking countries.  It is classified by the game historian R. C. Bell as a &quot;running fight&quot; game and by the game historian David Parlett as a &quot;linear war&quot; game.  Games in these categories are relatively rare (Tablan, Puluc, and Daldos being virtually the only other known examples).<br/><br/>The game is played on a board with 4 rows and anywhere from 7 to 15 columns.  One player fills the bottom row with playing pieces; the other player fills the top row with his or her pieces.  Four casting sticks are used to randomly generate moves for the pieces.  The two center rows of the board are treated as a looping track along which pieces move linearly in a counter-clockwise direction once leaving their home row. It is primarily on these two central rows that the battles take place, with a piece capturing an opponent piece by landing on its square.  A few special movement rules add complexity and strategy to the game.  A player wins by capturing all of the opponent's pieces.<br/><br/>There is some speculation among game historians that T&acirc;b may be a descendent of the ancient Egyptian game of Senet (similarities include linear movement and the use of casting sticks).<br/><br/>",

        "description": "MythWars: Clash of the Gods is a CCG (customizable / collectible card game) for 2-4 players, aged 12 to adult. A typical two player game takes less than 20 minutes, while four player games have been known to last over an hour.<br/><br/>In the game, each player controls a team of 4 gods, goddesses, and/or other entities, each with a different ability: some abilities may help their teammates, or hinder the opposing teams; others grant special attacks, or bring in extra reinforcements. New gods and/or goddesses are revealed as the game progresses, and each one in play gets an attack each round. Attacks are determined by comparing the attacking entity's Attack score (plus a die roll) to the defending entities Defense score (plus a die roll). Similarly, two entities may Clash, comparing their Energy scores (plus die rolls), with varying results. Entities remain in play until they run out of Energy points, at which point they are removed from the game, and the winning player is the last one with any gods and/or goddesses left.<br/><br/>The gods, goddesses, and other entities come from various mythologies, and are grouped together by their culture of origin. Each culture has eight Entity cards (gods and goddesses), and each &quot;Battle Set&quot; has two cultures, for a total of 16 cards per set. Battle Set 1 (Greeks vs. Norsemen) was released as a print-and-play game on August 25th, 2012. Battle Set 2 (Egyptians vs. Japanese) will be released similarly on September 9th, 2012. Battle Set 3 and 4 are slated for early and mid-2013, respectively.<br/><br/>The game itself has a deck building element, as any four gods or goddesses can be brought together for a team, and some combinations are more useful than others. There is also an element of luck, as dice are used in determining attacks and Clashes, and which is amplified by the game's Critical Roll system (wherein a roll of 6 &quot;almost always&quot; wins).<br/><br/>The full rules and the card information (including the card images) were publicly released under a Creative Commons Attribution-NonCommercial-ShareAlike 3.0 Unported (CC BY-NC-SA 3.0) license.<br/><br/>",

Seventeen of the cards come from Munchkin Bites! 1 and 2, and they form a rigged demo that can be used to teach the game. The remaining 3 cards are new and there are no corresponding English versions. All 20 cards have a jack-o-lantern as the icon.<br/><br/>The packaging for the booster set is clear plastic, and there is nothing inside but the cards themselves (no rules, etc.). Thus, the name of the booster, 'Baum', comes from the top card that's visible through the packaging.<br/><br/>The cards in this booster were originally released as part of the Munchkin Bites Halloween DVD set, which is now out of print. The DVD set, unlike this booster, includes the rules on how to run the demo.<br/><br/>The 3 new cards are:<br/><br/>     Dragwolf<br/>     Eine Frau wie Dynamit<br/>     Omen XXIII<br/><br/><br/>Note that these 3 cards have been re-released as part of the Munchkin Sammlerkoffer, but the icon is the Sammlerkoffer icon, not the jack-o-lantern.<br/><br/>Part of the Munchkin series.<br/><br/>",

It is challenging enough to interest adults and experienced gamers, but simple enough to appeal to kids old enough to put a thought into something.  It is designed for 3-10 players, ages 12+, although we've seen 10 year olds play quite well. Cards are played from the hand onto a play area that is 16 cards square; four rows of four cards. The novel nature of Mahta Mahti cards is that as uniquely square cards with matchable numbers on all four sides, each card is rotated to find the best match.  Even more unique is that the scoring landscape constantly changes as cards are played on top one another. Right card; right spot; best match; best score.  It's that simple. A little strategy, a little arithmetic and a lot of fun.  The kind of game that makes kids dream of college, not monsters.<br/><br/>",

The board is seeded with the proxy and blocking tiles and then players take turns playing a tile or replacing a proxy with a matching regular tile and placing the proxy somewhere else.<br/><br/>When a tile is played it must be next to or one space away from an &quot;object&quot; tile, and must either be one lower or higher than that tile, or equal to it if the play is on one of the starred spaces in the center.<br/><br/>Points are scored for getting scoring tiles (those numbered 1, 3, or 7) in scoring rows; a scoring row is an orthogonal row of three or four of a player's tiles, but if there are three they must be in sequence (with wraparounds allowed). Points are also scored for creating situations in which the opposing player cannot play.<br/><br/>",

As the ultimatum was rejected, Austria-Hungary then declared war, marking the outbreak of the war.<br/><br/>While France and Russia immediately sided with Serbia, Germany joined the Austria-Hungary and started a surprise offensive in the west with the objective of quickly defeating the French, to then turn east and knock the Tzarist Russia out of the war.<br/><br/><br/>1914 is a game of World War I conflict simulation at the strategic level. It recalls the most decisive battles fought by Austria-Hungary on both the Balkan and the Eastern Front in 1914. Although based on historical events and battles, the players in command of the two factions can modify the evolution of World War I.<br/><br/>The game is recommended for two or four players, but has a good solitaire suitability.<br/><br/>Developed with a system of wooden blocks and cubes and played out over 2 70x90 cm multicolor mapboards, with more than 300 wooden/plastic components created by the best Italian artisinal industry and painted &quot;A buratto&quot;, a technique usually adopted for painting car parts and accessories.<br/><br/>The rules are divided into three major sections which can be learned one at a time:<br/>&bull; The Basic Game Rules introduce the basic concepts and enable players to start playing the game without too many rules to remember.<br/>&bull; The Advanced Game Rules provide more specific and detailed rules for enhanced realism.<br/>&bull; The Optional Rules are for those who want to get the most out of the game, with rules for Strategic Warfare, Amphibious Landings, and more.<br/><br/>In 1914, 1 cm is approximately 10 km, a turn is 1 month long, and a full-strength counter represents a major military formation, normally corps size with some divisions and brigades.<br/><br/>The game can be played with &quot;Fog of War&quot; on (with the faces of wooden blocks hidden from the opponent) or off (all units are visible).<br/><br/>",

One player on the active team draws both a character card and an action card, then silently acts out the card combination &ndash; for example, a bowler imitating Tarzan.

For example, Party Orcs can be defeated with either weapons or a barrel of brandy, while the Monster That Can Only Be Defeated By Flaming Arrows can only be defeated by... uh... flaming arrows.<br/><br/>Each player has a hand of 7 cards, drawn from the deck. There are three categories of cards, Items, Encounters and Effects.<br/><br/>You can only have 10 weight worth of weapon, tool, treasure and container cards in front of you, but you'll need a variety of item cards to defeat monster, quest and puzzle cards that are played in a 3x3 grid in the center of the table. Encounter cards are worth points, and the person with the most points after one of the four quests has been completed wins.<br/><br/>Throw in some fiendish traps and game-altering effects, and you have a table full of mayhem as players juggle weapons, treasure and sacks full of kittens as they navigate an increasingly absurd dungeon.<br/><br/>",

You don't control the team breaking in, you control the guards. Although 'control' isn't quite the word; you watch as your team follows their patrol routes, then - via a hand of cards - interject with that casual glance over the shoulder or decision to switch direction at a critical moment, to catch the intruders... off-guard.<br/><br/>Facility is a solo game that plays out as a cross between a deckbuilder and an AI-driven miniatures game. The player controls the actions of his guards by buying and playing cards from his deck, while the intruders follow a simple set of rules to sneak up behind the player's guards, knife them in the back and drag their bodies out of sight.<br/><br/>",

Years of &ldquo;poor treatment&rdquo; has caused the rumblings of a mutiny among the crew aboard The Scream of Atlantis.  There is no agreement of who should usurp the Captain but some pirates are angrier than others. As the Captain, you&rsquo;ll need to balance the anger each of your crew members has while also keeping the mutiny meter below the combustion line. If you can successfully complete all of the missions while keeping your crew happy, will avoid a mutiny and won&rsquo;t get stranded.<br/><br/>The goal of the game is twofold: get through the chosen missions while avoiding a mutiny and to accumulate the most amount of gold possible. To do the former it&rsquo;ll likely come at the detriment of the latter. Your ability to manage the levels of anger and mutiny while pressing your luck will determine your success as a Pirate Captain.<br/><br/>",

Bang-bang-bang kerplow!<br/><br/>In a post-nuke irradiated hellscape, mechanized warfare evolves into its ultimate form: nuclear-powered Armored Flying Vehicles. Now, split-second death-duels are fought in the skies over the wastes of North America: from bootleggers to mercenaries, imperial armies to rock 'n' roll warlords, they all want their piece of the pie called Mega-Detroit.<br/><br/>High Speed Hover Tank is a fast-paced, card-driven-ish, dice-slinger's paradise. Ten unique models of Tanks - from the slick, speedy Viper, to the paralyzing Falcon, to powerhouses like the monstrous Tiamat - give players new tactical and strategic challenges in each scenario. A deck of Action Cards  enhances your options, and keeps you in doubt as to what your opponent can do, while the aptly-named Kerplow! Deck can change the battlefield dramatically or suddenly bring the game to a close. No scenario is going to play out the same way the second time around.<br/> To top it off, there are 10 scenarios for you to choose from. Punch a hole through elite Canadian armor. Out-bid your opponent for the services of Dido Blackhammer and her Death-Dodgers. Fight it out at point-blank range in the middle of a radiation storm. Or try to befriend Ethel, the Deranged, Homicidal, Also Terribly Lonely, Sentient Nuclear Tank.<br/><br/>High Speed Hover Tank is a glorious sandbox of action and excitement. So, fire up your nitro-boosters, roll your dice, and knock 'em out of the sky!<br/><br/>",

The cards are placed in various locations around the house or garden, and each player is given a shopping card that begins with a first item to be found.<br/><br/>The players move from one list card to another in search of the right items, noting the price of each. The first player to correctly fill a shopping card wins. Prices are used to check accuracy.<br/><br/>While the game is undated, it was probably issued in 1971 or shortly thereafter, since prices are listed in decimal pounds and pence, including the half penny. The game would have been a fun way to get used to the new decimal system, launched in 1971, and certainly preceded the elimination of the half-penny in 1984.<br/><br/>",

To start play, shuffle the animal cards, then spread forty of them on the table so that everyone can see them. Flip over one card, see the characteristic identified on this card, then race to pick up all animals that feature this characteristic. Once everyone has finished picking up cards, check all the cards collected to see whether anyone made a mistake; if so, that player must return the mistaken card and one correctly collected card.<br/><br/>Players repeat this process six more times, first laying out three more cards from the deck each time, then they see who has collected the most cards and won!<br/><br/>",

Do not push your luck either as BBQ may &quot;grill&quot; you.<br/><br/>To set up, place fifteen tokens numbered 2-16 in the middle of the playing area. One of the players takes a card and reads the question. All players may then take one of the numbered tokens, which represents both their bet and the number of answers they think they know. If the question asked you to name the planets in the solar system, for example, a player who took the #5 token is saying that they know five planets and are betting 5 points. One of the players is then chosen to give their answers. They win their bet if they succeed and lose it if they fail. The other players win their bets even if they didn't know any of the answers!<br/><br/>",

Cute, cheerful artwork and simple rules allowing for good depth and strategic play make it accessible to a wide audience.<br/><br/>&quot;Copy Power Battle&quot; involves choosing Kirby cards from your hand to defeat enemy cards on the table, after which you can gain different copy powers and abilities based on the type of enemies you've defeated. The player with the highest victory points after seven rounds wins, based on the cumulative point value of the enemies they've defeated throughout the game.<br/><br/>&quot;Simple Battle&quot; is a variant on the above gameplay with simplified rules that works better for younger or larger numbers of players.<br/><br/>&quot;Single Battle&quot; is a single-player variant involving a similar gameplay flow to Copy Power Battles, but incorporating waves of enemy cards that must be defeated to see how far you can progress without having your Kirby cards defeated.<br/><br/>Components:<br/>112 Cards (Kirby card &times;54, Enemy card &times;48, other cards&times; 10)<br/>Instructions<br/><br/>",

You&rsquo;ll join the fray as one of 11 characters, leverage clever card play to collect items, rushdown rivals, create powerful combos that launch them into the air and off the stage to outplay the competition. 'Iconoclash' captures the fast paced action and tactics of a platform fighter.   Choose your favorite character from a variety of board game universes. Each character has a unique deck and playstyle. Then select which map to fight on.<br/><br/>Each turn you&rsquo;ll play two attacks, each with three different effects to choose from. Meaning that every character has over 500 unique attack combinations. Some attack options require you to spend a Power Token, giving them an added kick to deal massive damage. Attacks also send your opponents flying, potentially launching them off the edge of the board to deal extra damage. All the while, you will move across the stage to keep your opponent in range, dodge stage hazards, collect items, and avoid attacks. Reduce your opponent's HP to 0 to win.<br/><br/>Featuring three Multiplayer Modes for up to 4 players:<br/>Classic Mode: Last one-standing wins. This mode is for players who love the classic no-holds-barred, last-one-standing action.<br/>Battle Royale: The player to deal the most damage after 4 rounds wins. This mode is great for players who prefer game play that is about maximizing combos and want to avoid player elimination.<br/>2 v 2: Team up with a partner for the win!

Your pieces need to keep moving and the board quickly fills with blocks, forcing you towards the endgame.<br/><br/>Each player has a power based on a mythological character, creature or artifact.  They have one prize and two rescuers.  Each turn they must move their prize (leaving a block behind) then one of the rescuers (which then builds on or excavates from a neighbouring space).  Since pieces can't move up more than one level and spaces become blocked off, one player will eventually run out of legal moves and lose -- usually when their prize is trapped by a combination of pieces and terrain.<br/><br/>&mdash;description from the designer<br/><br/>",

Players must balance the military difficulties imposed by the challenges of constrained urban warfare and unique terrain of the Huế Citadel, with the overriding considerations of each side&rsquo;s respective political goals. The North Vietnamese player must hold the city for as long as possible, to create a media event and lay the groundwork for a new revolutionary government. The South Vietnamese and American player must retake Huế before this process can advance too far, but not also jeopardize their own political sensitivities from casualties and heavy-handedness.<br/><br/>The map covers an area of 13 square kilometers (approximately 5 square miles). Each turn represents four to five days. Units represent platoon/detachment to battalion sized units.<br/><br/>&mdash;description from the publisher<br/><br/><br/>Published with Modern War #48.<br/><br/>",

The winner is the player who is worth the most blood at the end of the game - being their blood supply, and the combined value of their shares in fronts.<br/><br/>Functionally, the game is very close to being a retheme of 1830. Despite lacking trains, it is very much a train game.<br/><br/>Besides its theme, it is also novel for its map, monsters (which replace trains), and associates (which replace privates). The map uses cubes and nodes instead of tiles (like most 18xx games). You clear routes by removing cubes from the routes.<br/><br/>Some monsters have special rules - such as a ghost being able to pass through a token, or a werewolf that roams adjacent towns instead of a solid route.

On a turn, a player shakes the ten animal dice in the box, lifts the lid for a brief time, then covers the dice once again. Starting with the dice shaker, players place one card from their hand into a row, trying to play cards to match which animals have shown up at the party. If you can't remember or don't think your cards match the dice, you can pass.<br/><br/>Once all players have passed, remove the lid once again and place dice one by one on the cards in order. If a player played a card that doesn't match a die, they receive a cat token worth -1 points. All cards that match the dice are removed from the game; all cards that collected cat tokens are returned to the hands of the appropriate players.<br/><br/>Keep playing rounds until someone has no cards left in hand or someone has collected at least three cat tokens. Each card left in hand is worth -1 point, and whoever has the best score wins.<br/><br/>",

Centuries of war have brought death and destruction upon the people of the empire. Warriors from the every clan have ravaged the once beautiful landscape, in an effort to bring their masters closer to complete domination. It is only now that all sides have reached a stalemate. The only remaining solution is a duel of champions. With their glowing swords of power, the fabled blade masters have been summoned to one final contest to determine not only the fate of your clan,but the future of the empire of swords.<br/><br/>Set up the game by shuffling the 18 cards and dealing 7 to each player. Gameplay consists of each player playing a card from their hand face down, then simultaneously revealing. Thrust beats slash, slash beats chop, chop beats thrust. If your card beats the opponents card, you land a HIT. Parry blocks any of those. A successful hit after a Parry lands two HITs. There is also an unlockable strike card that cannot be stopped.<br/><br/>The game ends when either or both players run out of cards or someone receives 5 hits. The one to run out of cards or the one to have received 5 hits loses. If both players run out of cards and neither player has received 5 hits, the player that landed the most hits wins the game.<br/><br/>",

This settlement is your last hope, and you therefore give it an appropriate name: HOLDOUT.<br/><br/>Holdout is a roll-and-write resource management game in which you must grow your wasteland settlement and achieve certain objectives by the end of 7 game rounds.

        "description": "Triversi is a three-player version of Reversi (Tri-riversi). Similar to the traditional two-player Reversi, you flip the opponent's pieces by sandwiching them with your own color pieces. However, unlike the traditional Reversi with black and white pieces, this version uses red, blue, and yellow pieces. This introduces the thrill of not always gaining points when flipping pieces. Players have the option to place a piece face-down. It is a strategic abstract game.<br/><br/>&mdash;description from the publisher<br/><br/>",

Both sides require you to make great decisions based on good strategy, keep your wits about you when orders do not turn out well, and press on to victory.<br/><br/>Any time one side's morale reaches zero during a turn, the other side wins the game. <br/>Also, the French win if they hold out until the British Navy departs. <br/>And the British can win by taking Quebec.<br/><br/>Highlights of 1759: Siege of Quebec (2nd Edition):<br/><br/>New art style to the game board and cards<br/>New rules and game pieces for artillery<br/>New white French/red British/brown Indian pieces<br/>Updated rules<br/><br/>",

        "description": "Play 1 of 4 LEGO X-Pod models (Yellow/Red/Green/Blue) and construct a team of special units from set plans to deploy in head to head combat against those of your opponents.  Move your units across a 9x6 grid game board with various obstacles to score in your opponents home row.  The first player to score 3 units wins the game.<br/><br/>Each X-Pod has unique strategies and abilities:  The yellow Aero Pod has many flying and Jumping units, which allow it to navigate the board very easily. The Red Wild Pod has a wide variety of units and abilities, including the special EAT action, which allows its unit to destroy a weak enemy unit and repair itself simultaneously. The Green Robo Pod has very slow units, but it is very good at disassembling and destroying opposing units. Finally, The Blue Auto Pod. This pod has the fastest units in the game, allowing them to score quickly.<br/><br/>An additional X-Pod is included in the Game Pack. This black pod is a recolor of the Robo pod, and is included as a special edition pod.<br/><br/>In 2005, Lego released 4 more pods. A lime green pod with a Dragon theme, an orange pod with an Arachnid theme, a purple pod with a Monster theme, and finally a light blue pod with an aquatic life theme. Although these pods are not included in this or any other Game Pack, they can be used to play the game, using downloadable cards and boards available on Lego.com.<br/><br/>The five individual pods included in this pack are available individually under the names stated above, however they will not include any X-Pod Playoff game content, such as cards. If purchased individually, the cards, boards, rules and Inventory sheets must be acquired off of Lego.com<br/><br/>",

Not even from its Hanafuda deck, but also from materials (like cake tickets, Dharma tiles, war-fan, monthly track plate and small baskets), you will discover its uniqueness and grace.<br/><br/>Game system is very similar to fishing games like Casino, or Scopa, but only Japanese Hanafuda (and Korean Hwatu) includes turning a card from draw pile at your turn. And sometimes, splendid combination of taken cards becomes big score. These rules make the game more thrilling and brilliant. Hand combos are a bit complex but the basic is easy. Soon, you can learn them from charts. Because these hand combos have handicap points, you can select to play even with such a weak hands. In this case, turning a card becomes more thrilling.<br/><br/>After seen your hand, if you decided no chance to win, you can drop from the round like Poker. But you must pay dropping fee to the pot (winner of the round get the pot). This system may teach players self control.<br/><br/>It is convenient game for playing with 3 to 7 players. Active players are always 3 (or 2). Thus voluntary or not, other players should drop (If you have to drop involuntary, you can get compensation). Its playing style is loose paced, you shall feel the time of gentle (but hot hearted).<br/><br/>MOVIE : <a target='_blank' href=\"https://youtu.be/PW-_zUlbtzs\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer noopener\">https://youtu.be/PW-_zUlbtzs</a><br/><br/>",

To insure their survival, players must choose their loyalties wisely.<br/><br/>\t\t\t\t<br/>\t\t\t\t<br/>\t\t\t\t\tAim of the GameThe aim of Woodlands is to influence the war in your favour, and align yourself with the right Clans at the game's end. This is a done using a hand of 7 Warrior Cards. As the game progresses, players will shift their loyalties to suit their agenda. But only at the end will their final allegiances be revealed.<br/><br/>Players collect 1 Loyalty Cube for each successful attack or defence between their chosen clans. The player with the most Loyalty Cubes wins the game.<br/><br/>\t\t\t\t<br/>\t\t\t\t<br/>\t\t\t\t\tGameplay OverviewOn their turn players will be placing 1 or more cards from their hand, next to a chosen Burrow. These represent Warriors preparing to attack or defend a Burrow. Players will then draw back an equal number of cards from any of the 5 Burrows. This continues in a clockwise manner, until 2 of the 5 Burrows have been emptied of Warriors (there are no cards left to draw).<br/><br/>Once the war has ended (2 of the 5 burrows have been emptied of warriors), the most loyal players score points for their chosen clan's successes. Each player's loyalty is determined by the 7 cards in their hand. The player with the highest score is the winner.<br/><br/>",

You have a minimum value of gems to take out (bottom left on your player board) and a maximum. If you ever take out more gems than your maximum, you need to take a black coal and place it into your bottle immediately! If you empty your bottle, you need to place 2 coals in your bottle immediately. Black coals are bad, as they score -2 points at the end of the game.<br/>- discard one gem from your player board (meaning from the ones you shook out of the bottle or ones that you bought, can also be black)<br/>- activate an ability or end game scoring card. I just mentioned you have a maximum and minimum amount of gems you need to shake from your bottle, indicated by the cubes your your player board. You can increase either of the values by taking the cubes and placing them on either an ability or goal card. However, doing this costs you X Fairy points.<br/><br/>Abilities can be: you can buy an extra gem, discard an extra gem, if you take out an odd number of gems you get a coin, an even number gives you a point, or when you shake out a green gem you get a point. <br/>Goals can be a specific set of gem colours, no gems of a specific colour, most or least gems or coins. There are 10 different goal cards in total, so enough variety.<br/><br/>When the purple gems are all bought, the game is over! Score points for the objectives with your marker on them, the points you gained throughout the game, purple gems and deduct points for the black coals.<br/><br/>By the way, you can also call the help of the fairies, meaning you can spend X fairy points to perform an extra action on your turn.<br/><br/>There is also a B side to the player board, about 12 different goals and different player powers, which means enough variety and interesting choices.<br/><br/>",

In this adventure, an expedition of explorers will arrive in balloon to the mythical eighth island of the Canary Islands to find a fabulous treasure. The terrain is dangerous and the objects that can be carried are few, so all the players have to work together to be able to advance, find the treasure and return to the balloon.<br/><br/>The game consists of a board made of 49 reversible tiles and 10 tiles that form the treasure map, so that each game will be completely different. In addition, 12 inventory items and two decks of cards will make this journey a true survival adventure. As if this were not enough, a volcano in the middle of the island threatens to cover it all with lava, so the search will have to be against the clock.<br/><br/>In every round, players will make a movement (up to 3 tiles), reveal an event card and make an action (resolve the event with objects from the inventory, help another player, etc). The last phase of the round is to place a new lava tile.<br/><br/>",

Each player gets a dog-meeple and places it on the castle tile.<br/><br/>The active player picks up the two robber cards in the middle and either keeps them or gives them to one or two other player(s). A card may be kept only if the player doesn't have this card yet. (There are five different robber cards.) When the active player gives a card to another player and that player keeps it (i.e. doesn't have it yet), he or she may move his/her dog as many tiles as the number of cards the receiving player holds. If the receiving player has the card already, however, s/he shows it, discards one of the two and the active player's turn ends.<br/><br/>When a player has five different cards in his or her hands, he or she can draw a treasure card. If a dog moves around the track and reaches the castle again, the owner also draws a treasure card. The first player with either five treasure cards or 10 gold coins shown on treasure cards is the winner.<br/><br/>(User summary by HilkMAN)<br/><br/>",

The game shares some characteristics with Ludo/Parcheesi, except with two moving tracks and cards instead of dice.<br/>A variation using a color die instead of the ticket cards is: Stop the Train !<br/>In 2020 the game experienced it's reincarnation with LAMA Express published by Piatnik.<br/><br/>Roughly translated from Jurgen Herz's description on the Spiel des Jahres site:<br/><a target='_blank' href=\"http://www.spiel-des-jahres.com/spiel/1983/fuzzi.html\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer noopener\">http://www.spiel-des-jahres.com/spiel/1983/fuzzi.html</a><br/>On a small round track made from plastic rails, run two trains, each with five cars.  Each player receives four passengers - colored wood pieces - who must be brought to their destination station.  A passenger can only board a railroad car if the vacant car is directly before their entering space.  Once a passenger is on their way, it may happen that the railroad car stops at a changeover station.  Then the passenger must leave and wait for the next free railroad car to come by.  The movement of the trains is determined by small colored cards, which are drawn from a deck.  Since one can choose which of the two trains one moves, here begins the tactical possibilities of this game, which lift it above the mass of simple dice games for children.<br/><br/>",

Each player has 2 rooks and 2 bishops, each in its own warm or cool color. As each piece moves, it literally leaves a paper trail of cardboard chits showing its progress through the game. A piece can be captured at any point on its timeline by landing on a square containing a chit, and any actions taken since then by that piece are reversed. In this way a piece can capture an opposing piece 'earlier' than when that piece captured a friendly piece, thereby returning the friendly piece to the board. The game continues until all four opposing pieces have been captured.<br/><br/>",

A card is flipped over to start the discard pile<br/><br/>Each player on his turn can do one of the following actions:<br/><br/>Discard a card if its value is higher than the top card in the discard pile or if it has the same value and is the first card of equal value (there may never be more than two cards with the same value)<br/><br/>Playing the Photobombing paper, exclaiming the word photobombing loudly. When the card is played all the other players try to get rid of one of their own cards, only the fastest one will get rid of his card.

Competing pet monster creators are working on their own beasts, and aren&rsquo;t above sabotaging your monster with adorable features or an awkward waddle. Can you overcome their insufferable meddling to craft the most terrifying of monsters? Find out in Adorable Monsters!<br/><br/>Each player is dealt a hand of 7 adjective cards and draws 2 monster cards. Each player selects which monster to use and places that monster face up ion the table. You can only play adjectives that match the colors on your monster card. All players simultaneously make their monsters scarier by placing scary adjective cards on the table next to their monster. Once everyone has played their scary adjectives on their monster, everyone draws back up to 7 adjective cards.<br/><br/>During their turn, a player can challenge any other player to a Scare Off. The scariness of each player's monster is the number of scary adjective cards displayed next to their monster card. The winner of the Scare Off takes the losing player's monster card as a victory point, and does not daw any cards. The loser of the Scare Off draws 2 new monster cards, chooses 1, and draws back up to 10 adjective cards.<br/><br/>The first player to collect 3 victory points (opponents' monster cards) wins the game!<br/><br/>",

By providing entertainment for the delegates from seven different worlds, a player tries to curry favour. But if they give too much to one of the aliens, they will be penalised for favouritism. They will lose points, and their rivals may gain.<br/><br/>The game follows normal trick-taking rules, players following the colour lead. The cards shows an alien and the amount of hospitality the player is offering. Winning the trick gets the player the host spot and the cards go to their tableau.<br/><br/>Rounds end when a player exhausts their hand. The game end when somebody reaches enough points or enough rounds are played. The player with the most points wins.<br/><br/>However, the different alien races trigger effects, either when the card is played or scored. For example, a player might be forced out of a round, or lose points for having too many cards of one alien. This means players have to make more choices than simply playing high cards.<br/>user summary<br/><br/>",

SWING STATE is designed around the electoral college and the strategies involved in winning the 12 swing states during a US presidential election. It is super fun, super suspenseful, and the most realistic &quot;game&quot; about running for president you will ever experience.<br/><br/>The game can be played between 2 players.  It can also be played between 2 teams, ideally with 2 players for each team. One is the presidential candidate for the red team -- she chooses which states to visit each turn. Her teammate is the campaign manager for the red team -- he chooses where to spend the money on advertising.<br/><br/>The game begins with a map that reflects the way all 12 swing states actually lean. Pennsylvania leans Democratic by 4 percentage points (based on a historical average of recent presidential elections). That 4% point lean is reflected by four blue chips placed on PA during setup. Virginia, as you can see in the image, leans Red by 5% points (chips). As players campaign and advertize in these states, the chip stacks rise and fall and often flip from one color to the other.<br/><br/>A big part of the fun is that Swing State is a game that is easy to learn, easy to set up, and easy to play, but has a very rich mix of strategies that change each time you play. There are seven turns before election night.  And what makes this one of the most exciting games you will ever play is that the results of how each state will vote are not revealed until the very end.  At the end of the game -- election night -- all of the campaign funds you have invested by playing cards face down on each state are finally revealed.<br/><br/>",

It is not for a specific product or release. Versions will appear on the individual item pages.<br/><br/>    <br/><br/><br/>Future Card Buddyfight is a Japanese collectible card game from the same creators as CardFight!! Vanguard and Weiß Schwarz. It was released in January 2014 alongside an anime series by the same name. A manga adaptation began circulation in November 2013.<br/><br/>In it, players take turns playing monsters and other cards in an attempt to reduce the opponents life points to 0. Monsters are played in one of three zones&mdash;center, right, left. If the center space is empty, that player is vulnerable to attack.<br/><br/>There are five card types: Flags, Items, Monsters, Impacts, and Spells. A player&rsquo;s deck consists of 52 cards: 1 Buddy (a monster card), 1 Flag&mdash;both of which start the game in play&mdash;and a main deck of 50 cards which cannot contain more than four copies of any given card.<br/><br/>1 booster box contains 30 booster packs. Each pack contains 5 random cards. The rarities of cards are categorized into Common (C), Uncommon (UC), Rare (R), Double Rare (RR), Triple Rare (RRR), Buddy Rare (BR) and Special Parallel (SP).<br/><br/>",

If a player can defeat a band in each of 16 cities, they can then move into the center city, and attempt to win one last battle to score a record contract, and win the game.<br/><br/>The band names and logos, printed onto the old-school wooden 45rpm record adapters that are used as the player pawns, the board, and the card art and text combine to portray a world out of the school notebook of some mid-1970's Led Zeppelin loving, Dungeons and Dragons obsessive teenager.<br/><br/>Players take turns moving around the board a number of spaces determined by the roll of a standard die, either fighting a band battle, rolling for movement again, or passing play depending on where they land. Each player holds a hand of five &quot;Fate&quot; cards, which might be one of four kinds of band members that can be played in front of the player, and persist from turn to turn; bonus cards that can help the player in battle; and cards that can be played to penalize other players. During a battle, the player draws a &quot;Foe&quot; card, representing a band they will battle, rolls a four-sided die to determine which band member will battle, and plays Fate cards to boost their chances. The result of the battle is found by rolling a twenty-sided die, plus whatever bonuses from the players own Fate cards, penalties from cards played by other players, versus a score on the Foe card. If the player wins the battle, they collect the &quot;banner&quot; for the city, tracked by each player on a card reminiscent of an auto-bingo card. Play passes around the table until a player collects all 16 of the banners, allowing them to finally enter the center city, &quot;Numenor&quot;, and battle one last time in a bid for victory.<br/><br/>",

You play the role of an ambassador on board Babylon 5. You explore the vast stretches of space, lead huge fleets into battle, and control the economy of your faction. There are several ways to achieve victory ranging from economic growth to all out militaristic control of the universe. Diplomacy is not to be neglected either, as the more powerful game changes are brought up in Babylon 5 council vote to be decided.<br/><br/>You construct your playing 'board' using hexagonal shaped pieces that come with the game. The various pieces are different and can represent a multitude of things so that the game is different every time you play. In addition to the board and the ships that move on it, there are cards. Players may buy cards allowing special actions above and beyond the normal game, like an extra move or more EPs.<br/><br/>Using your faction's wealth and resources you play the game and explore the map. You search for planets to colonize and possibly conquer. Use your fleets to engage in battles and use characters to assist you in reaching your faction's goals. The choices are yours and will decide if your faction is successful.<br/><br/>",

Belarusian citizen has internation passport by default, but he can visit a little amount of countries without visas.<br/><br/>A board is a map of Europe. The goal of the travellers is to collect as many points as they can for visited countries. And this is not always about countries' quantity.<br/><br/>In the beginning of a game a player gets citizenship (Russia, Belarus, Ukraine or Kazakhstan), 100 euro and three bonus cards. A player puts his meeple on the board in a country of his citizenship.<br/><br/>In a player's turn he can do one of the following actions:<br/>- to visit a new country by bus, by plane or <br/>by hitchhiking. A player moves his meeple to new country on the board. In order to do it he needs to pay corresponding money (price for bus travel or plane travel) or roll a dice (using luck in hitchhiking).<br/>- to earn money by working in a player's current country.<br/>- to make Visa (Schengen Visa or UK Visa). Without Visa it is impossible to visit most countries in the game.<br/>- to make international passport.<br/>Also a player in his turn can play bonus cards.<br/><br/>For visiting new country a player gets a flag of the country and gets corresponding points; then he gets a bonus card.<br/><br/>A game ends when all countries are visited. A player with the most points wins.<br/><br/>",

With the help of 2 dice we set the machine's clocks in successive turns and thanks to that we move on the time track. Requires very careful planning of subsequent moves.<br/><br/>We use 2 D6 dice each turn. Using their results we decide how to set the 2 hands of the clock, one result directs one of the hands, the other the next. The result is also compared to the other clocks (whether it is greater, lesser or equal) which can give a point bonus. Next, we move a given number of fields on the time map in such a way as to stop exactly on the field with the historical event which gives a lot of extra points. The game lasts 6 turns after which the player who moved back in time the most while visiting the highest scoring events wins.<br/><br/>-description from designer<br/><br/>",

The malevolent Corporation is ever expanding its sphere of influence, annexing more and more star systems. Their strategy is to make contact with alien civilizations, dazzle them with a few gifts of techno-bauble and then offer membership &lsquo;as equal partners&rsquo; in the Great Galactic Co-prosperity Sphere. In the space of a few years, of course, the governments of those worlds will be changed by bribery, corruption, political intrigue, blackmail, threats and assassination, into puppet-states. They will devote all of their planets&rsquo; resources to enriching the Corporation and the few local bureaucrats that &lsquo;run the business&rsquo; for it, while their populations plummet into a state of poverty and servitude...<br/><br/>Warpath is a 28mm sci-fi wargame, in which you control teams of soldiers around a wartorn landscape. Warpath follows a new concept for mass battle miniature wargaming -- a game that is both easy to learn and fast to play! With few and simple rules, there is little to get in the way of the fun and slaughter.<br/><br/>This is a challenging game of strategy, where you can pit your wits against your opponent without devoting half of your brain power to remember a plethora of convoluted rules.<br/><br/>And that&rsquo;s not all, the innovative turn structure allows you to play using a time-keeping tool (like a stopwatch or a chess clock) to time your moves. As the seconds tick away, the pressure and excitement this adds makes Warpath unlike any science fiction wargame you&rsquo;ve ever played before.<br/><br/>Units are given simple ratings such as'Melee Attack', 'Defence' and 'Nerve' and then augmented with special abilities that characterise the different races that inhabit the universe.<br/><br/>It comes with 8 races struggling for power, as far four have been revealed; the Marauder Orx, the Forge Fathers which are technologically advanced Dwarves, the Human Corporation Marines and Enforcers, and the mysterious rat-like Veer-myn.<br/><br/>",

Each turn, you draw two cards from a common draw pile, and use these cards to form and assist your gang members. If you draw a gang member, you can add him to your gang (but have to pay him money each turn). If you draw a special ability (like drug king) or a racket (selling stolen cars, owning an illegal gaming club) you can attach it to any of your gang members. You can also happen to draw crack cards (alcoholic, drug addict, rat) that you have to attach to any of your members.<br/><br/>&quot;Smugglings&quot; and &quot;heists&quot; usually require more gang members than you have in your gang. Team up with another gang, decide on how to split the loot, roll the die to determine success. If the hit/smuggling failed, all participants must roll the die to see if they were caught (in which case the gang members are lost). If it succeeds, all gangs involved secretly choose the card &quot;deal&quot; or &quot;you're fucked&quot; and show it to the others simultaneously. If all shows &quot;deal&quot;, the loot is split according to the deal. If one of the gangs shows &quot;you're fucked&quot; he takes the lot. If two or more shows &quot;you're fucked&quot;, there is a shootout, the police arrives, and no one gets anything.<br/><br/>There is also the option to use your gang members to kill off your opponents cronies in order to take command of their rackets or to steal their money.<br/><br/>The game is language level 2 or 3 borderline case.<br/><br/>",

As a character gains more power-ups, they become stronger and harder to kill.

(&quot;Koro&quot; is the Japanese onomatopoeic word for the sound of rolling, as in &quot;Saikoro&quot; &mdash; dice rolling.)<br/><br/>In the game, players work to complete constellations of stars and build up victory points to win. There is a pool of dice &mdash; e.g., ten dicee in a four-player game &mdash; and after the dice are rolled, each player chooses two from the pool leaving two that are shared by all players. Now each player combines the two dice they have and the two pool dice to create two pairs of dice. If a player grabbed a 1 and a 3, and the remaining pool dice are a 2 and a 5, they could make the following pairs:<br/><br/><br/>    a 3 and an 8 (1+2, 3+5)<br/>    a 4 and a 7 (1+3, 2+5)<br/>    a 5 and a 6 (1+5, 2+3)<br/><br/><br/>Using one of these pairs, the players place cubes onto the constellation cards. When a card is full, it scores for each player who has cubes on it. A round ends when a player is out of cubes or a fifth card has been completed. Players score bonus points, then the game is reset and play continues. When a player gets to 40 points, the game ends after the completion of the current round, then the player with the highest score wins.<br/><br/>Whilst there is some luck in the game, there is choice as well. The last player to take from the pool decides which two will be the pool dice, and turn order affects outcomes, so there is plenty to consider.<br/><br/>&bull;&bull;&bull;<br/><br/>サイコロを振って、選ぶ、思考型ゲームココに星誕！プレイヤーは天文学者となって、星座に光を灯すゲームとなってます。<br/>やることは、ダイスを振ってキューブを置くだけのシンプルなルールです。しかし、すべてがオープン情報なので、ダイス選びやキューブ置く陣取り要素までが、とても悩ましいゲームになっています。<br/>星のためにできることやってみませんか？<br/><br/>",

        "description": "For many decades, Bangalore was the Garden City of India, but now it sports a different avatar. With the rise in IT companies all over the city, Bangalore became popular as the Silicon City of India, sometimes also referred to as the start-up capital of India. Ask a local about the Bangalore they remember, and you will be taken on a walk down memory lane of an era gone by: Sprawling green parks filled with trees, beautiful lakes, bustling markets and shopping centers contrast the buzzing business and industrial areas against the solace of cosy residential areas.<br/><br/>Namma Bengaluru &mdash; or &quot;Our Bengaluru&quot; as translated from the native language Kannada (which is pronounced &quot;Kun&quot; like in &quot;gun&quot; and &quot;nada&quot; like &quot;na-da&quot;) &mdash; is a game inspired by the publisher's hometown of Bangalore, India.<br/><br/>In the game, you plan and build neighborhoods in the city of Bengaluru. To start, you have a hand of two tiles (with tiles coming in five types) and a neighborhood card that shows a way to score points. On a turn, you either play a tile into the city, matching tile types or roads to do so; swap the tiles in hand for two new ones; draw a neighborhood card; or remove a neighborhood card in hand to place a tile on top of an existing tile. When no tiles remain in the draw pile, each player takes a final turn, then reveals their neighborhood cards, scoring for each pattern of tiles in the city that matches what's shown on their card; some cards provide bonus points based on your ability to place tiles of the right type next to scoring patterns you have.<br/><br/>Whoever scores the most points wins, with ties being broken in favor of whoever holds fewer cards.<br/><br/>",

The pieces are things that came from hardware supply stores (those little plastic caps for twisting wires together make nifty rocketships, eh?), including the magnets one must mount into the board.  The roulette I mentioned is spun now and then during the game, and the magnets and iron bars ensure it &quot;clicks&quot; into proper alignment every time.<br/><br/>Basically a two-player game, it can be played by teams of two or three.  There are nine &quot;winning levels&quot; of varying point value: the Weeble (conquer three star bases of different colours), the Skunk (conquer the Time Zone, e.g. 8 blue planets plus a Quasar Shield), the Sweep (conquer all six Star Bases without Weebling first), the Shield (possessing both Quasar Shields), the Shaft (Weeble and Shield), the Level (Skunk and Shield), the Fase (Sweep and Shield), the Scoop (Weeble, Shield and Skunk) and the Quase (Sweep, Shield and Skunk).  And then it gets complicated...<br/><br/>The game is just plain weird, with a distant whiff of Cosmic Encounter to it.<br/><br/>",

The player with the most pegs surrounding a hexagon has temporary ownership, denoted by putting a disc in the hexagon (in the case of a draw, ownership remains unchanged).  Once a player gets half the vertices around a hexagon, they get permanent control, denoted by putting a peg in the disc.<br/><br/>Once all hexagons are permanently controlled, the game ends, and the player with the most pegs wins.<br/><br/>Clearly biased in favor of the first player, but rather nice nonetheless.<br/><br/>",

The remaining piece is placed in the center of the board. Each player then places one of his pieces on the board. The first to put a piece with a the same color or shape as another piece already on the same diagonal, row or column, loses the game.<br/><br/>The loser gets point equal to the value of all his remaining pieces.

Players then draw the top 3 cards to form their hands. In a preliminary round, players take the top card from their piles and play them onto their board space. If no cards match but one is a Mr. T card, the player who played Mr. T wins all the cards. If two or three cards match, a showdown takes place in which players play cards from their hands trying to be the only player to match one of the non-matching cards played by another player. The winner gets all the cards played. If you lose all your cards you're out. When only 2 players remain, the one with the greatest number of cards wins.

It is a standalone game with Japanese, United Kingdom and US Vehicle, Weapon and Organizational tables in the same format as Angriff. It was published in 1976 between the Third printing of Angriff in 1974 and the Fourth printing of Angriff in 1978. If you have played Angriff, you will be able to play Banzai. Banzai adds Jungle fighting, amphibious assaults, Naval bombardment, snipers and ambush optional rules. You do not need Angriff to play Banzai, although there are rules in Angriff that could be applied in this theatre of operations but would most likely not what Pacific fighting was known for (like urban fighting)<br/><br/>",

If it is farther than a rod's length, leave it where it stopped, and you will flick it again on your next turn.<br/><br/>You can bump your opponent's floes, but never flick them. If a penguin is bumped off a floe, just place the penguin back on. If you  knock your own penguin off, flick from next to the South Pole on your next turn.

        "description": "Sixteen is an original card game for two players, ages 8 and older. It is easy to learn (about 5 minutes) and takes about 15 minutes to play, though players will find themselves wanting to play again and again before they put the deck away.<br/><br/>Each player is dealt three cards. The remaining cards are placed face-down in the middle of the table as the draw pile. The cards are numbered 0-6. There are two of every card, but only one zero card for each suit. There are also two wild cards. Players take turns, picking a card, and then adding a card to a fanned-out, face-up play pile.<br/><br/>There are two ways to win a set: when the face-up cards total 16, or when the last three cards in the win pile are all the same color or number. So, you have to pay a lot of attention to what's in the pile, as well as what's in your hand, as well as make some educated guessing about what could very possibly be in you-know-who's hand. If the play pile goes over 16, a &quot;bust&quot; is declared and the other player gets the win. The player with the most sets when all cards have been played wins the round.<br/><br/>All of this results in some rather delicious strategic implications. The game can become quite competitive, but the elegance of the game, and the element of luck, keep the competition focused, and light-hearted.<br/><br/>The instructions describe four optional play variations, one of which extends the game play to younger children (perhaps as young as 6), but the game plays best with the recommended ages.<br/><br/>",

The game is based on the comic book character &quot;Batman&quot; by DC comics.  It includes 1000 questions covering 65 years and multiple decades of Batman history.<br/><br/>Depending on the space the player lands on, when the player answers a question correctly they receive a power card that gives them bonuses to being either a) Batman or b) a villain.  If the player answers a question correctly from a villain space, they receive a villain card.  The player must then make his way to the currently upturned location card.  Once there, the player attempts to &quot;capture&quot; the villain by using power cards against the player sitting next to them with the added luck of a dice roll for each.  When a player captures 3 villains, he wins the game.<br/><br/>The question cards each include 5 questions representing 5 difficulty levels. i.e.:<br/><br/>1. Batman's secret identity is what playboy billionaire?<br/>2. True or false.  The Wayne manor grandfather clock is set to the time of death of Bruce Wayne's parents.<br/>3. After the Grasshopper stole the batmobile, batman installed an alarm to ensure it never happened again.  What villain was subsequently tripped up by that alarm?<br/>4. Selina Kyle's brother Karl is better known as whom?<br/>5. Several incarnations of the batmobile were designed by what stuntman?<br/><br/>As you can see, the questions get progressively harder.<br/><br/>",

Working from a hand of 6 tiles, players create paths/designs by matching the design along 1 card edge in play while alternating colors. The &quot;black-color-black-color&quot; sequence can only be broken by the Corner tiles, which must be mated to a Full tile in the *same* color as the corner.<br/><br/>A round ends when the 8th Corner tile is played. Each Corner is worth 2 points; all other cards are 1 point; and the player who placed the round-ending corner deducts 3 points from his/her score.

        "description": "This is the Lone Canuck scenario pack that covers WW II actions from Operation Autumn Mist.  The pack contains 18 scenario cards.<br/><br/>Here is a description of the scenarios from the Lone Canuck web site:<br/><br/>16 December 1944..... The village was defended by Company B, 1st Battalion, US 110th infantry Regiment and M36 tank destroyers from the 630th Tank Destroyer Battalion. Company B was well dug in and the German assault companies assaulted the village but were unable to pierce the perimeter and were forced to infiltrate the woods north and south, heading for their primary objective, Clervaux.<br/><br/><br/>16 December 1944..... The German Volksgrenadier Division 212, made a successful and relatively uneventful crossing of the Sauer around Bollendorf in the early hours, overrunning small American outposts along the river line without giving them a chance to radio a warning. Although Colonel Chance commander of the US 12th Infantry Regiment, 4th Infantry Division immediately opposing them was aware because of reports from the US 28th Infantry Division further north that an attack was in progress. Even though speed was of the essence, the German assault companies of Volksgrenadier Regiment 423 with their objectives the American command post in Consdorf and artillery positions in Scheidgen. Partially ignored orders to bypass pockets of resistance became involved in costly and time-consuming battle for the insignificant villages of Berdorf and Lauterborn.<br/><br/><br/>17 December 1944..... General von L&uuml;ttwitz&rsquo;s orders required Volksgrenadier Division 26 to establish bridgeheads across the river Clerf by nightfall on the 16th, so any enemy resistance had either to be subdued quickly or bypassed. As it turned out, the biggest stumbling block turned out to be the Company K, 3rd Battalion, 110th Infantry Regiment and Company B, 103d Engineer Battalion in Hosingen. The American defenders were simply too well dug in to be shifted easily and the close-range battle, with dozens of individual hand-to-hand encounters, swayed backwards and forwards all day. In the evening, four Shermans arrived from the 707th Tank Battalion, but failed to bring any rifle ammunition with them. The constant delays imposed by the defenders in the handful of villages along Skyline Drive forced KoKott to unleash his reserved Grenadier Regiment 78 whose 1st Battalion was thrown into the struggle for Hosingen, supported by a few Jagdpanzer 38(t) from Panzerj&auml;ger Abteilung 26.<br/><br/><br/>17 December 1944..... Screened by the mist which aided all of the Volksgrenadier Division 352&rsquo;s assault companies, the leading two battalions fortuitously struck at the junction between the US 109th Regiment&rsquo;s 2d Battalion, whose Company E was in F&uuml;hren and the 3d Battalion&rsquo;s Company I deployed in front of Bettendorf. Lt. Colonel James Rudder, the commanding officer of the US 109th Infantry Regiment immediately drew upon his meagre reserves and sent A and B companies of the 1st Battalion supported by 1st Platoon Company C, 707th Tank Battalion into a counter-attack. Although progress was slow by nightfall Company A was in sight of Longsdorf and Company B was overlooking Tandel. The morning of 17 December brought as series of uncoordinated attacks by 2nd Battalion Volksgrenadier Regiment 915 against F&uuml;hren while the 1st Battalion had its hands full with the Americans counter-attacks at Longsdorf and Tandel.<br/><br/><br/>17 December 1944..... Alerted by the Seventh Armee&rsquo;s preliminary artillery barrage, Colonel Rudder moved Company G up on the right of Company F, replacing it in Brandenburg by Company C from the 109th&rsquo;s reserve 1st Battalion, which was stationed in Diekirch. During the night remembering his orders to avoid confrontation and leave American strong points to be mopped up by the reserve Fallschirm Regiment 13, Oberst Gr&ouml;schke took advantage of a wooded defile to continue advancing west in between the 109th&rsquo;s companies F and G. But early on the 17th the 2nd Platoon from Company C, 707th Tank Battalion moved into position to block the regiment. By daybreak on 18 December the GIs were completely cut off, even though they had not been attacked Colonel Rudder ordered them to fight their way out south to Diekirch helped by the tank platoon.<br/><br/><br/>17 December 1944..... Before dawn on 16 December the engineers of the Fallschirm-Pioniere Battalion 5 began ferrying the assault companies of Fallschirm Regiment 14 across the Our. Their instructions were to head as rapidly as possible west to the river Clerf, establish a bridging site near Kautenbach and press on west to Wiltz to establish a blocking line behind the river S&ucirc;re south of Bastogne. Their line of advance actually lay at the intersection of Lt-Colonel James Rudder&rsquo;s US 109th and 110th Infantry Regiments and immediately in their path at Weiler was Company I, 3rd Battalion 110th Infantry Regiment. Generalmajor Ludwig Heilmann&rsquo;s orders to both his 14th and 15th Regiments called on them to bypass any pockets of resistance in the villages. Leaving those to be mopped up later by his reserve 13th Regiment. One such village was defended by six 105mm and three 75mm Shermans from Company C 707th Tank Battalion and a part of the 110th Regiment&rsquo;s anti-tank company.<br/><br/><br/>19 December 1944..... By early evening Volksgrenadier Regiment 916 had command of the heights in the Our/S&ucirc;re triangle and Volksgrenadier Regiment 914 taking up its place in the centre of the division&rsquo;s line, could begin to make more headway. The US 109th Regiment with Colonel Rudder&rsquo;s command post back in Ettelbruck was now formed in an arc in front of Diekirch. However, it was a sadly depleted regiment. So far the Volksgrenadier Division 352 was handsomely repaying Colonel Rudder for his audacity on Omaha Beach six months earlier.<br/><br/><br/>20 December 1944..... While Panzer Lehr was still struggling toward the Clerf River on 18 December, Panzer Division 2 was rolling west across the river through Clervaux. In the van, was the reinforced Aufkl&auml;rungs Abteilung commanded by Hauptmann von B&ouml;hm. Taking the road which skirt to the north of Donnange and Lullange, the Kampfgruppe ran into the first of the Bastogne roadblocks at the Antoniushof farm road junction a task force from CCR/9th Armored Division. The next opposition lay at Baraque d&rsquo;Allerborn, where a second task force of CCR/9th Armored Division was waiting. Kampfgruppe von B&ouml;hm attacked here at dusk and within 15 minutes destroyed 24 Shermans. Kampfgruppe von B&ouml;hm had its last encounter with the Bastogne roadblocks at Herbaimont on 20 December, which was manned by an outpost of the 327th Glider Infantry Regiment, 101st Airborne Division.<br/><br/><br/>20 December 1944..... General der Panzertruppe Eugen Walter Kr&uuml;ger&rsquo;s LVIII Korps encountered difficulty when the Aufkl&auml;rung-Abteilung 146 found that the bridge over the river Ourthe west of Bertogne had been blown. Kr&uuml;ger then ordered Panzer Division 116 to retrace its footsteps and head northwest through Houffalize towards La Roche and Sam&eacute;e instead. The US 7th Armored Division&rsquo;s trains were at La Roche, but their main supply depot had been moved to just outside Sam&eacute;e. Early in the afternoon of 20 December, Panzer Grenadier 60 began assembling in the woods south of Sam&eacute;e while Panzer Grenadier 16 prepared to attack straight down the road, with Volksgrenadier Regiment 1129 on its right. The US 7th Armored Division&rsquo;s quartermaster delayed destroying the supply dump because he was told a task force from CCR/3rd Armored Division was on it way to Sam&eacute;e. CCR was only able to send a small armoured force commanded by Major John Tucker and consisted of a company of Shermans, a troop armoured Cars, a platoon of light tanks and a battery of M7s. Task Force Tucker moved into Sam&eacute;e from the north.<br/><br/><br/>20 December 1944..... After helping Oberst Heniz Kokott&rsquo;s Volksgrenadier in their final assault against Holtzthum, Oberst Paul von Hauser&rsquo;s Kampfgruppe 901 followed the rest of Panzer Lehr, which had already crossed the Clerf at Drauffet. The division&rsquo;s reinforced Aufkl&auml;rungs-Abteilung, Kampfgruppe von Fallois and the following Kampfgruppe 902 had had a brief skirmish at Eschweiler just north of Wiltz but Bayerlein left the subjugation to this thorn in the division&rsquo;s flank to the following Volksgrenadiers and Fallschirmj&auml;gers. However the Bastogne defences, which a day earlier had lain wide open were now being rapidly reinforced as the 101st Airborne Division deployed. Company I, III/501st Parachute Infantry Regiment started entering the village of Wardin from the northwest, unseen in thick morning mist. Part of Panzer Lehr&rsquo;s Aufkl&auml;rungs-Abteilung moved into Wardin from the northeast at the same time and the two groups inevitably collided in the middle.<br/><br/><br/>23 December 1944..... The biggest problem faced by Oberst Hans-Joachim Kahler&rsquo;s F&uuml;hrer Grenadier Brigade, is that it was committed piecemeal and unable to launch a full-scale counter-attack against either of the American III Corps&rsquo; division it ran up against, the 26th in the west and the 80th in the east. Called out of OKW Reserve on 22 December the brigade was originally intended to cross the S&ucirc;re at Ettelbruck and then head directly to the support of Fallschirm Division 5 around Martelange but the threat posed to Ettelbruck by the arrival of the US 80th Infantry Division caused this to be amended. Kahler put one company of F&uuml;siliers apiece into Eschdorf and Heiderscheid and sent two south with a platoon of Panthers to Grevils-Br&eacute;sil hoping to establish contact with the leading Regiment of the Volksgrenadier Division 352. The American 80th Divisional Commander, Major-General Willard Paul, had decided earlier that the ground was unsuitable for tanks so for once it was the GI&rsquo;s who had no armor support.<br/><br/><br/>24 December 1944..... Recognizing that Fallschirm Division 5 was out on a limb and although Volksgrenadier Division 352 had finally captured Diekirch that a wide and dangerous gap had opened between the two divisions. Heersgruppe B Commander Field Marshall Model reassigned the former to LII Korps on 22 December and reinforced it with the F&uuml;hrer Grenadier Brigade. At the same time he also released Oberst Alois Weber&rsquo;s under strength Volksgrenadier Division 79 from reserve and assigned it to Kniess&rsquo; LXXXV Korps. The village was weakly defended by Colonel Bandy&rsquo;s 2d Battalion US 319th Infantry Regiment who had captured in a fierce fight the night before from the F&uuml;hrer Grenadier Brigade. The F&uuml;hrer Grenadier Brigade StuG&rsquo;s and Sdkfz 251&rsquo;s would spearhead the attack.<br/><br/><br/>24 December 1944..... The Battle of the Bulge was only days old and Fritz Bayerlin&rsquo;s Panzer-Lehr Division pressing westward throughout the day. Kampfgruppe von Poschinger took St. Hubert without any resistance late that night. The advance continued towards the important road centre of Rochefort. Early the 23 December the town was shelled and a German reconnaissance patrol was sent in and reported that the town was empty. Rochefort was in fact well defended by some of the US 3rd Battalion, 335th Infantry Regiment reinforced by with Regimental anti-tank guns and one platoon each from the 638th Tank Destroyer Battalion, 309th Engineer Combat Battalion and 29th(Separate) Infantry Regiment. At about 0200 hours, Panzer-Lehr Division resumed the advance and was stopped by intense crossfire. Bayerlin was forced to set up a systematic and time-consuming attack. The American defenders fought back stubbornly from house to house. The Panzer Lehr&rsquo;s field guns were brought up to pound the eastern approaches. Then supported by weight of Panthers the Grenadiers of Poschinger&rsquo;s Kampfgruppe launched their assault crossing the L&rsquo;homme River by early afternoon.<br/><br/><br/>24 December 1944..... The intention was to cut the Hotton-Marche road capture Marche and advance toward Ciney on the right flank of Panzer Division 2. Brigadier General Boiling&rsquo;s US 84th Infantry Division had deployed along a 12-mile defensive front from Hotton to Jamodenne west of Marche. Von Waldenburg began his attack towards the Hotton-Marche road by infiltrating two companies of his Aufkl&auml;rung-Abteilung 146 through the woods southwest of Verdenne on a ridge just to the north of the village. This lay at the junction of the 84th Infantry Division&rsquo;s 334th and 335th Regiments outflanking them both. They were detected and thrown back in an American counter attack at noon on Christmas Eve. At the same time Oberst Voightsberger&rsquo;s Panzergrenadier Regiment 156 supported by five panzers from I/Panzer Regiment 16 launched the main assault against Verdenne.<br/><br/><br/>25 December 1944..... By midday of 23 December, Kampfgruppe von B&ouml;hm had reached Buissonville and by nightfall was just outside Ach&ecirc;ne, only 20 kilometres from the Meuse at Dinant. Montgomery was given command of Allied ground forces in the northern sector of the bulge, had begun deploying British forces to support the American defences and the under strength 3rd Royal Tank Regiment was now at Dinant. During the night 23-24 December, patrols scouted out the positions of Kampfgruppe von B&ouml;hm and shellfire began rain down around Foy-Notre-Dame.

You are the driver of Bus 13, which has stalled in a nearby beanfield.  The bobbies are upon your brothers and sisters, and you must see how many you can save!<br/><br/>Since the Battle of the Beanfield occurred in a neighboring beanfield, you don't need the board or the trilithons - although having them set up nearby might help you picture the scene.  The eight pawns represent the bobbies, and each of them will have corralled eight random hippies.  Each will also have a random card in front of him.  Each round, you will reveal eight cards, one at a time, which you will generally try to place in front of a bobby according to certain rules that depend on the card in front of him.  The card you place will indicate which color of hippies you can free from that bobby's clutches.  In this fashion, you have seven rounds to liberate as many of your brothers and sisters as possible.<br/>  <br/>Battle of the Beanfield is an official game for Stonehenge: An Anthology Board Game and the Nocturne Expansion.<br/><br/>",

You pick up five chess cards and if you have the corresponding chess piece, then you can move it like regular chess. But because your opponent does not know what cards you have, they may make very risky moves and may even try to bluff you!<br/><br/>After you play a card, you pick up a new one and always have five cards to choose from. There are also two Jester cards (wild cards) which can be played to re-claim or move any of your pieces.<br/><br/>",

        "description": "The players move trough squares at the sides of the board, like in Monopoly. The central part of the board is a map of Western Europe, with 18 squares over each country divided in sets of three. Each set of three has a different colour, and a letter inside. The three &quot;I&quot; stand for Industry, T is for Tecnology, P is for Pesca (fishing), Tr is for Transport, A for Agriculture, and E for Energy. At the beginning of the game each player picks a card with the objective for the game, for example: &quot;Take control of all the Fishing of the Mediterranean countries plus Portugal&quot;, or &quot;Take control of the Energy and Industry of Netherlands, Belgium and Luxembourg&quot;. Each player has plastic counters to put over the map, on the squares with letters he needs, so when all three squares of one resource have plastic colours of one colour, their owner takes control of the resource. To put a counter on one map square, the owner must first gather a license of the resource he wants, then land on the squares of the board that allow you to place counters on the map, and then pay for them. A player can put any number of counters in one go, as long as he has the license needed, and as long as he can pay for them. <br/>The sides of the board, where players move, have several different squares. In some of them, the players can get money, or purchase licences, in others the players can put plastic counters on the map, in others they can alter the price of each counter (for example, &quot;Rise 4000 ECUS the price of Tecnology&quot;), and in others they can put counters at half-price or for free.<br/>The game includes a table to track the ups and downs of the prices of each resource, and money (1000, 5000 and 10000 ECUS banknotes. ECU, by the way, was the first name proposed for the currency that we all call Euro now.).<br/>When one player gets his Objective, the game ends, and the player who has gathered more money wins, so sometimes the first to get the Objective is not the winner.<br/><br/>",

        "description": "Matakana is a game for 3 to 5 players of planting seeds, harvesting vegetables and selling them to customers at the bustling Matakana market.<br/><br/>Players will compete for sunshine, soil &amp; gnomes (of course!) in a race to plant seeds and create the most bountiful garden.  Those vegetables are then harvested and taken to the local market where players sell to the waiting customers.<br/><br/>A game of Matakana takes place over rounds of two distinct phases: Gardening &amp; Harvesting.<br/><br/>GARDENING PHASE<br/><br/>In the Gardening phase, players will compete with each other to take a row of cards that will allow them to cultivate their garden. The cards that players collect are:<br/><br/>1) Gnome cards - allows players to collect gnomes which act as a currency of sorts when planting seeds<br/><br/>2) Soil cards - allows players to take soil tiles and lay them in their garden (soil tiles come in various shapes and sizes and you will need them before you can plant any seeds)<br/><br/>3) Sunshine cards - dictates which columns in your garden you are able to plant seeds in this round.<br/><br/>Depending on the draw of the cards some rows will be more lucrative than others and it will be up to the players to decide when is time to compete for those cards. Once players have collected their cards they will lay soil and plant seeds according to those cards.<br/><br/>HARVESTING PHASE<br/><br/>The second phase of the round involves rolling 3 regular dice to determine which column of your garden will harvest vegetables.  The player rolling the dice choices a pair of dice from the roll and the sum of those dice is the column in the garden that all players can harvest.  Players then take vegetable cards that match the seeds they have planted into their hand.<br/><br/>Players will now have an opportunity to openly trade with each other for vegetables that they do not have.  Players will do this to sell a certain group of vegetables to waiting customers at the local market.  The market is a 9x9 grid made up of 9 customers of varying colours.  Each of these customers is wanting different combinations of vegetables and the players who can serve that customer with the vegetables that they are wanting will take that &quot;Customer&quot; and place it face up in front of them.<br/><br/>SCORING<br/><br/>Once the deck of Customers runs out the game will end and players will tally up their scores.  Points are given for:<br/><br/>1) Creating full columns of seeds in their garden<br/>2) Having the majority of Customers of a certain colour (with points available for those in 2nd and 3rd)<br/>3) Having the most money at the end of the game<br/><br/>To do well in Matakana requires a player to do well in all areas of the game: creating a bountiful garden that harvests often, trading wisely with other players to ensure you have the vegetables that you need and finally, keeping an eye on what customers other players are serving so that you can maximize your scoring opportunities.<br/><br/>A game of Matakana takes approximately 60-90 minutes and players 3-5 players.<br/><br/>",

Two players or teams direct the actions of the German and Soviet forces as they seek to capture or regain territory and to inflict losses on the opposing forces while minimising their own losses.&quot;<br/><br/>The Russians try to create a pocket, and then destroy the German forces, while the Germans sek to free their trapped comrades. Simple, but subtle mechanisms, reflect trade offs between all out attacks and greater losses, and the mobility of armoured units.<br/><br/>",

To emerge the victor, you must carefully manage a mismatched court of nobles to create the most prestigious kingdom the world has ever seen.<br/><br/>Bloodlines is a micro game using 20 playing cards and 5 cubes. Each player drafts a hand of cards, each of which has a special ability and a point value that contributes to your influence in that suit's bloodline. Once all cards have been played, the prestige of any lines you control is based on presence of cards of that type in your opponent&rsquo;s kingdoms.<br/><br/>Each card you play has an associated special ability, and that card remains in your Kingdom as influence in that bloodline. The card abilities are:<br/><br/><br/>     Ace (1 Influence): The Assassin may eliminate any unprotected card from the game, including any heirs placed on the card. <br/>     10 (2 Influence): The Castle protects all of the played cards in your kingdom from the effects of the Assassin and the Jack.<br/>     Jack (3 Influence): The Jack may swap any two unprotected played cards of equal Influence value. You may swap for a lower valued card if swapping from your own kingdom. <br/>     Queen (4 Influence): The Queen may produce an heir on any card you have played, including herself and cards in Castles. The heir increases this cards influence in that bloodline by 1.<br/>     King (5 Influence): The King has no ability, but he may be played directly into an empty Castle already in your Kingdom.<br/><br/><br/>Full Rules available in the files section below<br/><br/>",

But this is not an easy task: the practitioners will first have to collect the ingredients for the powerful spells &ndash; Lucky Clovers &clubs;, Bleeding Hearts &hearts;, Dead Man's Spades &spades; and Powdered Diamonds &diams;. Only then they will be able to kidnap the members of the merchant families and bend the authority to their will!<br/><br/>The Salem Conspiracy is a dice drafting game that is played with seven character cards, a standard 52 card deck and four 6-sided dice. At the beginning of the round, players roll the dice, which determines which of the seven character cards that are laid on the table can be used that round. Players take turns assigning the four dice to the different character cards and execute their abilities, which allows them to draw cards, impair their opponent or manipulate the deck or their hands of cards. If players are holding three cards of the same suit, they can choose to discard them at the end of the round and take a J, Q or K of the corresponding suit, provided they have used the specialized character on that round. The first player to get one J, Q or K of every suit under their control wins the game!<br/><br/>",

During Winter, the game is set up. During Spring, players add tiles into an empty play area to form an initial group in any shape. During Summer, the group changes and grows as the players add two tiles and take one away each turn. The first gist of the game is that all these three actions must be used on different colours. Finally during Autumn, only one player takes a single tile and the game ends.<br/><br/>The second gist is that at the end of the game, the value of a collected tile is based on the tiles remaining in the group: multiple small, separate areas of the same colour make it valuable, but many of them might vanish or be easily connected into one large area, resulting in lots of negative points. Players also have control over the game's length and Autumn can arrive unexpectedly.<br/><br/>The basic two-player game has no structural hidden elements, it consists only of 11 red tiles, 13 blue tiles and 15 yellow tiles, and the rules are easily adaptable for thematic additions and personal variants.<br/><br/>",

So, you should beware your competitors, other villains who are eager to add the prefix super to their proud title.<br/><br/>Today becoming the Supervillain is even simpler than ever! A new boardgame by Right Games and Anton Lozovskiy provides you with everything you need for this fascinating activity. But for opponents &mdash; I assume every self-respecting villain must have some.<br/><br/>Become Supervillain is a boardgame for two&mdash;five players aged 12+. While competing for the title of the principal anti-hero, players spend their minions to complete secret projects, spin vicious intrigues and shatter opponents' plans with meteorites. You must be first to collect secret projects valued 5,000 points to win the game. Besides, the game can end earlier if all plan cards have been drawn. Then a player with overall maximum points becomes the Supervillain.<br/><br/>There're two types of cards: plans (they are also secret projects and meteorites) and intrigues (they are also minions). Before the game starts, cards are shuffled into two separate decks and each player draws two intrigues. At turn's start, the active player draws a card from each deck, puts the intrigue in his/her hand and decides what to do with the plan card either by playing it face-up as a plan or face-down as a meteorite. To complete plans you need minions: as soon as the total value of minions on one of your plans become equal or exceed its cost, it becomes the secret project and yields victory points. Often it also gives you special abilities. If you don't want to handle some plan, you may turn it into a meteorite and send at somebody as a valuable gift. Then the card is put face-down with the arrow pointing at your victim. The latter has time before your next turn to deal with the flying meteorite (some intrigues allow shooting them down or even redirecting them). If your meteorite has successfully hit the victim, you draw an extra card from the deck and &mdash; the most important &mdash; destroy a minion on any of his/her plans.<br/><br/>Intrigue cards can also be played in two ways. First &mdash; as an intrigue itself, in accordance with its text. Their effects are versatile and cunning as true villain's thoughts: take cards from opponents, charge meteorites, protect yourself, accelerate plans, etc. Second &mdash; as a minion, by placing it on your plan (its value is indicated in the upper part of the card). During your turn you may play only one intrigue and one minion or just keep them for some better time.<br/><br/>Become Supervillain is a speedy and funny parody boardgame with simple rules and lively gameplay. It learns not only to be cunning and vicious but also to shatter other villains' plans. Finally, if our world has to face the Supervillain, let it be you and not some thorough scoundrel.<br/><br/>",

The massacre of Canadian prisoners by the SS, who viewed such measures as rather common-place when they fought on the Eastern Front, was never forgotten or forgiven by the Canadians. The conduct of the fanatical 12th SS Hitlerjugend unit made it very clear what the war on the western front would become, and what the stakes were in this conflict.<br/><br/>Each copy of Nemesis  is comprised of the following:<br/><br/>--One 11 by 17 inch hex map with game charts and tables <br/>--52 double-sided, un-mounted counters <br/>--4 pages of rules with designer notes<br/><br/>Players use a standard deck of playing cards to activate their units and resolve some game events. A six-sided die is also needed to play the game. A complete game takes about 1.5 to 2 hours to complete. Designed for two players, Nemesis is very interactive, and is also very solitaire friendly. The game is designed by Paul Rohrbaugh with graphics by Bruce Yearian.<br/><br/>A cardset for Nemesis, that replaces the standard deck of playing cards called for in the rules, is also available. It features appropriate graphics and rules reminders on pertinent cards.<br/><br/>",

They would hold a contest with each clan's best warriors...<br/><br/>In Shadow Strike, you take control of a small group of ninja warriors; trying to be the last ninjas standing on the map. You will fight using each ninja's personal inventory, consisting of Shuriken, Smoke Bombs, and... Candy Bars. Throughout the game you will gain access to better equipment for you ninjas, such as Swords and Grappling Hooks. You will also earn precious action cards that will really screw over your enemies.<br/><br/>Shadow Strike mainly focuses on movement tactics on a hexagon board, as well as dice rolling and &quot;take that&quot; card play. Once only your ninjas are on the board, you win!<br/><br/>",

Corner rooms have a slightly different mechanic, and the end game is a sort-of Choose-you-own-adventure storyline. You win by visiting all Corner Rooms and then returning to the center of the map. You lose by running out of light or a party wipe. All of this combined will give you about an hour of a comedy of errors... err, entertainment. Enjoy!<br/><br/>",

        "description": "A Simple Game<br/>Dark War uses a simple system, based on a single rule. Anytime you role a 4 or greater you get a success. That success might mean you pump two AK-47 rounds into a werewolf, or that your nurse heals a team member, or a witch gains control of a weak-minded soldier, forcing him to fire on his comrade. What varies are the dice that you use. When building your own character, you assign a fixed number of dice (4 x D4, 3 x D6, 2 x D8) to seven attributes--Shooting, Melee, Speed, Intelligence, Charm, Will, and Dodge-- to determine what type of individual you control. The more dice and the better the dice assigned to an attribute, the greater chance you have or rolling successes. But the customization doesn't end there. You can use experience points to buy Kickers, such as &quot;Rifles,&quot; which adds an extra D6 when firing a rifle or &quot;Power of Prayer&quot; that allows a character to heal a teammate within two squares. Two many options? Just choose a group of pre-generated characters from the bestiary, slap them on the provided map, and have at it. Or, if you prefer, you can fight out one of the three, included skirmishes<br/><br/>Obviously attributes such as Charm and Intelligence can be put to great use when roleplaying, but Dark War's unique Action Cards ensure they are relevant even when fighting a quick skirmish.  For example, when an opponent activates a character you can slap the Fear Action Card on them, forcing them to pass an Intelligence test or lose all their actions. Other Action Cards can reload a weapon, add a die to melee, or even heal a wound.<br/><br/>When the fighting breaks out, characters determine initiative by rolling a combination of their Speed and Intelligence dice. The total determines when they act (higher is better, obviously) the number of successes determines how many Actions they have. Simple, fluid, and highly interactive.<br/><br/>Many RPGs say &quot;Here are the rules, now go buy your own stuff to play with.&quot; Dark War is different. In each game you get the core rule book, 18 Action Cards, a 17&quot; x 22&quot; battle map depicting a West German village, and 70 1&quot; square counters that include Russian and American soldiers, civilians, werewolves, vampires, witches, dead folks, zombies, and more. Better still we include a handful of stands, enabling the counters to functions as standees. It's like having your own set of Dark War minis. Furthermore, the rules include three ready-to-play skirmish scenarios (In the Beginning, Stranger Things, My Enemies' Friend) and a beginning-level, one to two session adventure titled, The Escape, complete with generated characters.  When we say &quot;Ready to play,&quot; we mean it.<br/><br/>It's a small unit skirmish game, it's a roleplaying game, it's straight-up fighting or weird war combat. It's whatever you make it. It's the Dark War Roleplaying game.<br/><br/>Frequently Asked Questions<br/>Can I play the skirmish game solitaire? Sure, you just have to play each side to the best of your ability.<br/>Can I use my own miniatures? Of course you can. You can use your own minis, terrain you have made, 1&quot; square battle maps that you have bought, or even hex maps. Nothing in the game precludes that. The difference in Dark War and many RPGs is that you aren't REQUIRED to buy that. We give you everything that you need.<br/><br/>",

        "description": "The Road to Bethlehem - Journeys Through Time and Space is a family-weight, Christian-themed, RPG-style, cooperative game where players must work together, guided by a GM, to journey through ancient Palestine to arrive in Bethlehem to witness the Nativity and encounter the newborn infant Jesus.  Players play as modern day travelers who have been spirited away by the Archangel Gabriel (the GM) to partake of this journey.  Players must go through a series of scenarios, drawn randomly, during which they are offered choices by the GM which then dictates what challenges and choices they next face.  Players must conserve equipment and, most importantly, time on their journey, while also working to increase their individual attributes of Authority and Reputation.  The game uses the REAL System - a mechanic where the players do actual, physical interactive challenges at various points as part of the gameplay, the outcomes of which determine their progress in the game (such as identifying objects moved by the GM in a given room, finding commonplace house items within a certain time limit, or dexterity challenges). Once the players have gone through all 8 scenarios, they arrive at Bethlehem where which ending they've achieved is based on how much time they used on their journey.  The GM guides the players using 'The Book of Adventures' which contains step by step instructions for each scenario and narrative text that is read to the players.<br/><br/>The game is geared primarily towards families and can be played by multiple age levels from age 8 and up, but with the caveat that an adult always play as well and serve as the GM.  The total campaign with all the scenarios takes 4-6 hours to play, but the game can easily be saved between the scenarios, with each scenario taking roughly 30-60 minutes to complete.<br/><br/>&mdash;description from the publisher<br/><br/>",

        "description": "Gadzooks it&rsquo;s the Apocalypse is a fantasy battle game set in the first half of the seventeenth century, a time of widespread warfare, religious strife and general unrest. It was a time when very bad things were happening and when people saw signs of the end of days and the coming  of the Apocalypse. So we thought - that sounds like fun times lets make a game!<br/><br/>Each player in the game will control one character figure and a bunch of dubious looking henchmen. The character will have a detailed profile, a number of skills and qualities that can be improved upon if scenarios are survived and experience is gained. Henchmen are cheap and expendable and there are always plenty more to hire. But players should beware, evil forces are at work at every turn and as their characters grow in power, the temptation to follow the path of evil will be strong. Will characters risk their humanity by gaining sinister new powers or will they take the path of good. All will have to decide as the end time approaches.<br/><br/>&mdash;description from publisher<br/><br/>",

Each player has an identical set of pieces in a unique color. The goal is to get rid of all of your pieces by placing them on the hexagonal game board. Each piece that you place after the first cannot touch previously-placed pieces of the same color; instead each piece must be a distance of &quot;1&quot; from another piece of the same color, where 1 is the length of a side of one of the small hexagons. Another restriction is that the distance being measured can't directly cross another player's piece, but it can lie at the junction of two pieces. Once all players have placed as many pieces as they can, they count the number of hexagonal units in the pieces they couldn't place, and the player with the lowest score wins.<br/><br/>",

        "description": "Boba Boss is a fast-paced, brain-twisting, color and word association game. The game is crazy simple and easy to figure out. It takes less than a minute to learn and even less time than that to play it. A round can be over in mere seconds!<br/><br/>Boba Boss can be played with 2 to 6 people, but packing the table to the max is more fun. Everyone plays as an employee at a boba tea shop. Your goal is to win employee of the minute, by filling all of your your seven tea cups before anyone else finishes filling theirs. Complicating the situation a little is the fact that not only are players filling their own cups, they&rsquo;re also spilling their opponents cups at the same time.<br/><br/>The game cleverly employs the stroop effect to test players' deciphering abilities and reaction times. Insani-tea is  inevitable and that's a big part of the fun. The cute boba ball theme and the delightfully simple game play make this game accessible to most anyone who isn't afraid to rub elbows at the table.<br/><br/>Do you have what it takes to become the Boba Boss?<br/><br/>&mdash;description from the publisher<br/><br/>",

The goal of DBT is to help us live in the moment, cope healthily with stress, regulate our emotions, and improve our relationships.<br/><br/>The Game teaches DBT skills by presenting a Conflict card.  Each player must use a dealt DBT Skill card to argue why their Skill is best suited to solve the conflict and win the round.  When you win a Conflict round, you gain points towards your Life Goal card.<br/><br/>There are two ways to win The Game: 1) Win the most rounds of Conflicts; or, 2) come closest to reaching your Life Goal Card points.  And even if you're not playing The Game, you can always refer to the Skill cards when you feel overwhelmed, or you need to make a difficult decision.<br/><br/>&mdash;description from the publisher<br/><br/>",

It takes something that a lot of people find intimidating and lonely&mdash;creative writing&mdash;and tries to make it lighthearted, fun, and just a little competitive. (Maybe more than a little for some of us.)<br/><br/>In Tall Tales, your group will write an original story together. Players each write their own scenes and submit them to the group in the hope that their scene will be chosen for the group&rsquo;s tale. A player wins by scoring the most points, which players score by having other players vote for their scenes and also by voting for the scenes that are popular with other players.<br/><br/>Tall Tales begins with a warm-up called the Quest Round in which players begin to imagine the world they're building together. After the Quest Round, the game plays out over three Scene Rounds. Players in the Scene Rounds each draft a scene for the tale and then anonymously vote on which of the scenes best meets the criteria for the round. The scene with the most votes becomes part of the tale in each Scene Round until your group has a final, three-part tale.<br/><br/>At the end of Round 3, players should count up their point tokens. The player with the most points wins the game. The winner of the game reads the completed tale aloud to the group, and all players live happily ever after.<br/><br/>-description from designer<br/><br/>",

The original 2022 version was a decently cutthroat competitive game.  The 2023 release is a friendly teams-based version.<br/><br/>The deck consists of two each of cards numbered 1-28, with each card representing a day in the month of February (one card is daytime, the other is nightime).  Each week (1-7, 8-14, 15-21, 22-28) is a different colored suit.  Additional special cards (such as a &quot;Leap Year&quot; card and a &quot;Reschedule&quot; card) are included and worked in based on player count.<br/><br/>\t\t\t\t<br/>\t\t\t\t<br/>\t\t\t\t\t2022 Rules<br/> Players must follow either the colored suit of the lead card, or the must play a card of the same day of the week.  Thus, the &quot;1&quot; card could be followed by either a card of that suit (a 1-7) or another Sunday (the 1st, 8th, 15th, or 22nd).<br/><br/>The highest card played which follows wins the trick (cards not following can't win the trick); in the event of a tie, the nighttime card wins.  The winner gets to mark the day on the calendar as theirs; if a marker is already there, it gets replaced.  The card winning the trick is removed from the game.<br/><br/>Once a full hand has been played, players shuffle the remaining cards, adding in a pre-determined number of special ability cards, and then play another hand, again competing for calendar space.<br/><br/>Having the most markers in a particular week earns two points; ties are broken by the marker closest to Sunday.  Having the most markers on a particular day of the week (i.e. Monday) earns one point; ties are broken by the earliest date.  Most points wins; ties are broken by the earliest date.<br/><br/>\t\t\t\t<br/>\t\t\t\t<br/>\t\t\t\t\t2023 Rules<br/> Players must follow the colored suit of the lead card. Unlike in the original game, players cannot follow by playing the same day of the week. However, the latest day following either the colored suit or the same day of the week will win the trick.<br/><br/>The winning team gets to mark a day on the calendar as theirs; if a marker is already there, it gets replaced. They can choose any space represented by a card in the trick. The card winning the trick is removed from the game.<br/><br/>Once a full hand has been played, players shuffle the remaining cards, adding in the special ability cards, and then play another hand, again competing for calendar space.<br/><br/>Having the most markers in a particular day of the week earns two points.

        "description": "This is a story-telling game that follows the structure of classic dramatic formulas. As a result, the stories created by players will have a complete structure and include exciting conflicts and twists.<br/><br/>The basic game consists of 6 rounds, each representing a chapter of the story, in order:<br/><br/>     Purpose<br/>     Obstacle<br/>     Breakthrough<br/>     Defeated<br/>     Turning Point<br/>     Ending<br/><br/><br/>Each round consists of four steps:<br/><br/>1. Ideation and Card Play<br/>All players brainstorm and think about the plot for the current round's chapter. For example, in the first round, players must state the story's purpose and include one or two cards in their hands.<br/>This step is not round-specific; any player can play his/her cards face down and place his/her marker at any time once he or she made the story in the head.<br/>As soon as three players have played their cards, this step ends.<br/><br/>2. Story-telling<br/>According to the order of play cards, players reveal their cards and describe the content of their story.<br/><br/>3. Vote for the Plot<br/>All players take one of their Admire tokens and hold them in hand, then simultaneously place them on the story they like the most, excluding their own. <br/>The story with the highest number of votes becomes the main plot.<br/><br/>4. Scoring and clean-up<br/>The highest-voted cards are placed on the Chapter board for this round, reminding everyone of the main plot's content.<br/>The players who told stories received Admire tokens, earning 1 point each.<br/>The players who voted for the main plot receive a Scroll token, earning 1 point each.<br/>Each player can adjust their hand of cards and then discard other cards played this round.<br/><br/>These four steps are repeated for the next round, continuing the storyline. For example, in the second round, players must describe the obstacles the protagonist encounters while trying to achieve their purpose.<br/><br/>After 6 rounds, the player with the highest score wins!<br/>At the same time, you will have created a structured, complete, and interesting story!&quot;<br/><br/>",

This deck includes 36 cards and some new rules.<br/><br/>3 cards are set aside at the beginning, and one of them is turned up to establish the current trump. The remaining cards are divided in 3 groups of 11 cards; each player takes one, and the remaining one forms the dummy deck. Three cards are turned face up from the dummy deck.<br/><br/>Players bid on how many tricks they think they will take in the coming hand. Next the first player plays a card from their hand, then a card from the dummy's hand, and then the second player plays a card. The trick goes to the first player who played a Wizard, or by the player who played the highest trump, or to the player who played the highest lead card. Jesters always lose. The dummy player may win a trick, and in fact its role is to help the first player winn or lose a trick as needed.  The player who won the round becomes the first player and starts the next round.<br/><br/>When players run out of cards, they check their bids and score. You score for making your bid exactly, and lose points if you did not make your bid.<br/>This version also has a special card that cancels the trick in which it is played - no one scores that trick.<br/><br/>First player to score 100 points is the winner.<br/><br/>",

But watch out for the traitor... they will keep it all for themselves.<br/><br/>SlackJack is a fast-paced 4-8 player hidden role game that plays in 10 minutes. Each round, one player takes the role of captain who must choose 1-2 pirate players to join them, aiming to form the best Blackjack hand. Every other player has hidden roles with powers and values that could be favorable or treacherous for their crew. Can you convince the captain that you are the right pick? Be warned: if the Captain picks the devious SlackJack, he&rsquo;ll steal the whole pile of gold for himself.<br/><br/>Once the captain picks their crew, the remaining players form their own treasure hunting party and all roles are revealed. The team that is closest to 21 in pirate value will all win gold for their own pockets. Pass the captain role to the next player and head back out on another hunt. The game ends when any player reaches 5 gold: exactly enough to retire to a tropical, traitor-free island.<br/><br/>-description from publisher<br/><br/>",

The pack consists of 72 cards - 50 unique station cards which have small photograph of area around station, 16 junction cards i.e. EARL'S COURT, BANK &amp; MONUMENT, HOLBORN [x2], KING'S CROSS, OXFORD CIRCUS, TOTTENHAM COURT ROAD, LEICESTER SQUARE [x2], PICADILLY [x2], BAKER STREET and CHARING CROSS [x4]. and 6 exactly the same Season Tickets [which act as jokers for interchange cards.]<br/>The Object of the game is go LOBO by making up a hand of two or more completed journeys either exposed or unexposed.  A completed journey consists of a junction card together with two station cards.  On the junction card are printed the names of starting or finishing stations made through that particular junction.<br/>Although rules state that game can be played by any number there is a limit to number of players which is constrained by the size of the pack which I suggest is 6 at most.<br/><br/>",

Each player also has 18 special &quot;moves&quot; cards in a shuffled deck, with a few lined face up. Each turn, a player plays one of his battle cards, and the turn winner (of the rock-paper-scissors) does 1 damage. The battle cards stay turn after turn, building up a line. After winning a turn, a player can use one of his face up moves if the requirements for that move corresponds with what he has in his battle card line, to release combos, dealing more damage. Each move also has a special effect that triggers when released.<br/><br/>For each damage a player gets, he reveals the top card of his moves deck. So, for each damage, the player gets access to more moves.<br/><br/>",

The player can turn freely but cannot move through the same hex twice. After the movement the player takes the tile he started from and put it in his/her personal supply. There is one restriction in taking tiles. A player cannot take a tile if this would cause the board to split up. In this case the player moves without taking a tile.<br/><br/>If in 4 consecutive turns none of the players takes a tile, the game ends. Then the players compare their fruits. Each fruit is worth one point, but a player will take the points only if he is one of the two players (one in a 2-player game) that has the biggest amount of this particular fruit.

        "description": "Rudder&rsquo;s Line is an AREA MOVEMENT game that simulates The Battle of Normandy, specifically the landing of the 2nd Ranger Battalion at Point du Hoc on D-Day, 6 June 1944. Players take the sides of the German 726th Infantry Regiment or elite US Army Rangers of the 2nd Ranger Battalion. Following an unprecedented invasion by landing and cliff-scaling in the face of enemy fire, the battle devolved into the quintessential hedgerow battle in Normandy&rsquo;s bocage. The Rangers were literally &lsquo;backs to the sea&rsquo;, cut off from friendly forces until a relief column reached them from Omaha Beach on 8 June 1944. The German defenders pushed James Rudder and his men to the point of annihilation. It was a &lsquo;near run thing&rsquo;.<br/>The game depicts the hedgerow fighting that followed the D-Day landing of the 2nd Ranger Battalion. It is meant to be a hard-hitting, fast playing board game that recreates the close-in and deadly nature of the battle, fought for each individual field.<br/><br/>Game Scale: The game is scaled at about 100 yards to the inch. Units for both sides are small groups of soldiers approximating squads, non-commissioned officers, FO&rsquo;s, weapons crews, and individual machine-guns, mortars, and shoulder-fired Bazooka and Panzerschreck rocket launchers. Each game turn represents six hours.<br/><br/>Game Board: The game board uses a US Army map of the battlefield, divided into a collection of 35 numbered areas or &lsquo;sectors&rsquo;. Areas come in various shapes and sizes, with a dotted green border separating them. Each area contains two numbers: an identification number in a green box, and a Terrain Effects Modifier number (proceeded by a + sign) in a yellow circle.<br/><br/>What You Get:<br/>One 11&quot; x 17&quot; hard backed game board;<br/>80 color mounted die cut counters;<br/>One 4-page rulebook;<br/>Players must provide one or more six-sided dice.<br/><br/>",

The FACs control all aspects of game play.  Teams are rated for their offensive and defensive ability, their ability to draw penalties, and their power play and penalty killing.<br/><br/>Players are rated on their scoring, passing, and penalty abilities.  Goalkeepers are rated as to saves and breaking up 2-on-1 chances.<br/><br/>The game has everything ... penalties, penalty kicks, bank shots off the dasher boards, goalkeeper assists and penalties.  The FAC deck keeps play moving right along ... a complete game, plus stats, can be done in as little as 15 minutes once a familiarity with the game exists.<br/><br/>",

To forestall this, von Hindenberg transferred four German corps from Prussia to the southwest corner of Poland and launched an offensive toward Warsaw.  By 12 October, they had driven the Russians back to the Vistula, just south of Warsaw, but there, outnumbered and over-extended, they ran out of steam.<br/><br/>Von Hindenberg in Poland simulates the intense back-and-forth struggle that began 16 October, with von Hindenberg's retreat from the Vistula.  Over the course of the ensuing six weeks, both sides surged forward and back, east and west, alternately threatening the other with potentially disastrous encirclements.  Special rules cover the effects of inferior Russian intelligence (hidden movement for the Germans), the combined effects of poor Russian logistical capacities and German scorched-earth policies.<br/><br/>Included in the The Great War in the East: Four World War 1 Battles Quadrigame.<br/>Folio edition contains Standard rules, Special rules, 17&quot; x 21&quot; map and 200 counters.<br/><br/>",

        "description": "Lixso is a new and original logic game, somewhere in between Sudoku and a puzzle. Fill a grid entirely using L-shapes with the 4 colors (or matching symbols I,X,S &amp; O), respecting the pre-filled cells, and in such a way that L-shapes with the same symbol/color don&rsquo;t touch &ndash; neither on a side or a corner.<br/>It sounds easy, but there are many ways to fill a 9 by 9 grid with L-shapes.  Each grid has only a single correct solution, you will need to use logical reasoning to find it. There are 6 difficulty levels. Try level 1 or 2 to learn the game &ndash; one can easily see which symbols fit or not, and with each added L, others become clear. But for level 4, 5 or 6, it is more difficult. Sometimes you have to imagine or place a whole chain of L-shapes to find out if it leads to the solution. First, place those L-shapes of which you are certain. Do observe the entire grid, as sometimes you have to continue on a whole other part of the grid.<br/><br/>Lixso can also be played with 2 to 4 players &ndash; rather than solving the puzzle, this becomes a competition to place the most L-shapes on the grid.<br/>The symbols/colors are divided among players. With 2 players each has 2 symbols, with 4 players each has 1. With 3 players each has one symbol, and the remaining symbol is shared among players. <br/>The purpose of the game is to place the most L-shapes.<br/>Place L-shapes in turns, while possible &ndash; and keep the count for each player. If you can&rsquo;t, skip a turn. The game ends when no-one can place another L-shape. The Player who placed the most L-shapes wins.<br/>Rules number 1 and 2 apply: respect the pre-filled cells, and L-shapes with the same symbol cannot touch. (an L-shape also cannot touch a pre-filled cel of the same symbol!)<br/>Rules 3 does not apply &ndash; the grid does NOT need to be filled, empty cells can remain.<br/>And herein lies the whole interest of the multiplayer game: rather than placing the L-shapes to solve the puzzle, you place them competitively, trying to limit available space for the other player/s. You can try to place tiles in such a way that parts of the grid (with the symbols/colors) of your opponent/s) become impossible to use.<br/>As a variation, all players can play any of the symbols/colors. (don&rsquo;t forget to keep count while playing!) This way it is very hard to gain an advantage over the other player.<br/><br/>",

These images are selected from some of the most unforgettable panels of Mr. Lovenstein's catalog.&nbsp;<br/><br/>On their turn, players will select another panel from those available in the comparison row and place it in one of their section of the board's spaces.&nbsp; They will place the card with the green check mark side face up to indicate their target image is like this card in some way, or with the red x side up saying that their target image is unlike this card in some way. Each player will be able to do this process 3 times to give some guidance to the other players for guessing.<br/><br/>However, at any point if a player feels confident they know what target image card belongs to another player, they may place their corresponding numbered bet card face down in that players bet spot. Players only have one copy for each space so make sure to bide your time or know the risks if you go sooner.&nbsp;<br/><br/>Once all bets are in, players will take turns revealing the&nbsp; guesses made about their card and what card was actually theirs. Correct bets get points in the order they were placed so those who wait too long may miss out on points even if they were correct. Be ready to explain yourself after the round is done as hearing the thoughts behind why your friends made the connections they did is the funniest part of the game!<br/><br/>-description from developer<br/><br/>",

Each Player takes the role of a Dodo, trying to build the best nest possible.<br/><br/>To do so, the Dodos can go on Adventures, Trade and Build.<br/><br/>Each player starts out with the drawing of 3 starting cards, of which one is discarded to create the exchange stack.<br/><br/>To gather nest building materials, the Dodo Players have to go on Adventures in one of three card stacks (drawing cards). Those stacks consist of 2 different card types: Material and Action. To get better material cards, you need the right action cards on your hand to counter certain effects and be able to take the materials on your hand. Material cards from your hand can be built into a nest by playing them on the table in front of you. A nest consists of a maximum of 6 cards. Goal of the game is to score as many points as possible with different combinations of cards in your nest.<br/><br/>Another option to get the cards you need is to trade with other players, but not in a direct way. Depending on the number of players there are some cards available as an exchange stack. Players can trade cards from their hand with the exchange stack.<br/><br/>Each material card has one of three types, one of four themes and an individual value between 1 and 3. To build the perfect nest you require 2 cards of each type, preferably of the same theme and with an individual value as high as possible.<br/><br/>The game ends when one of the adventure card stacks is used up or one of the Dodo characters has lost all of its hit points.<br/><br/>Dodoresque consists of 90 cards, over 60 of them with unique artworks of our Dodos and their adventures.<br/><br/>While the mechanics of Cherry Blossom are the same as in the first Dodoresque, the game has all new illustrations, characters, landscapes, and some new special action cards.<br/><br/>Dodoresque: Cherry Blossom can be combined with Dodoresque: Jungle Fever for a game with up to 8 players.<br/><br/>&mdash;description from the publisher<br/><br/>",

Players take turns placing coins from their hands onto the map based on a simple set of rules with the goal of capturing coins that have already been situated on the map.<br/><br/>Coins are never flipped in this game, and the random element is determined by the pool of coins used to play. Thus every game is different and strategy varies based on the coins available. The length of the game is also determined by the deck of coins - when the pool is exhausted, the game ends.<br/><br/>Despite the geographical suggestion of the art, the game is not about conquering territories from neighboring territories, but involves planning ahead and placing coins to capture the most coins for yourself, while not creating an advantageous position for your opponent(s). Coins are captured based on comparative sizes of the coins (sometimes smaller, sometimes larger) and simple rules that are written on the territories.<br/><br/>",

You choose!<br/><br/>Just saying the word gladiators conjures up visions of vicious combat between desperate men, who fought to the death for the amusement of the crowd. These games of death continued throughout the Roman Empire for over 900 years. Now, with Heroes of the Colosseum, you can recreate the glory and splendor of these games.<br/><br/>While gladiator matches were the &ldquo;bread&rdquo; of the &ldquo;bread &amp; circuses&rdquo; that was used to placate the Roman citizens, chariot racing was the &ldquo;circus&rdquo;. Included in Heroes of the Colosseum, is a complete second game that lets you race chariots at the Circus Maximus.<br/>As a gladiator or charioteer, you start your journey to Fame &amp; Fortune far from the eye of the crowd. With luck and skill, you increase in abilities and work your way towards Rome. On the way, you will stab, slash, whip and bash all opponents who stand between you and your ultimate goal &ndash; freedom!<br/><br/>Inside you&rsquo;ll find:<br/>&bull;    Rules to personalize your gladiators and charioteers, making each truly unique.   <br/>&bull;    A way to generate Non-Player Opponents, totally controlled by the game mechanics.<br/>&bull;    Two Gladiatorial Arenas, one Racing Oval, beautiful counters, and Roster Sheets to represent the gladiators and charioteers, their equipment, and horses. <br/>&bull;    Quick to learn, but hard to master, combat and racing rules that accurately reflect the challenges of gladiatorial combat and chariot racing.  <br/>&bull;    An easy to use Campaign System, to track the success of your gladiators and charioteers, as they rise in abilities.<br/>&bull;    Three different Locales to fight in, from the Fringes of the Empire to Rome herself, where only the greatest can gain their freedom.<br/><br/>In Heroes of the Colosseum, you have everything you need to do this and much more. But perhaps the best thing about the game is that it can be played solo against the game mechanics, cooperatively with all players against the game, or competitively against your friends.<br/><br/>",

The player then declares to the other players which of the three types of cards he or she has played.

At this time, it does not have to be served as declared.<br/><br/>Finally, the cards placed by everyone are turned face up and the score is calculated according to their combination.<br/><br/>&mdash;description from the designer<br/><br/>",

Both economy and battles are affected greatly by the ability of staffs and generals. And the key to success is to strategically allocate proper subordinates to best provinces.<br/><br/>There are 129 characters in the Three Kingdoms and 40 castles on the map. The tactics cards are based on Sun Tzu's Art of War and other ancient books. The miniature armies are made of metal. Different scenarios are planned to be available on the web.<br/><br/>",

Players gain control of the cards by correctly answering curious census questions, then test their skill and luck by determining if the next card is higher or lower than the previous card. Complete with the action-packed Money Round, play Card Sharks and win BIG!&quot;<br/><br/>Based on the classic game show, two players compete to flip over their row of cards by correctly predicting the response to various surveys (one player gives a number, the other guesses &quot;higher&quot; or &quot;lower&quot;). Whoever wins that question then plays a higher-lower game with their row; players may freeze after a correct card prediction, as a wrong guess removes and replaces all unfrozen cards; the player also loses their turn if the next card is the same as the one before it. Completing the row, or having your opponent fail to do so by the fourth &quot;Sudden Death&quot; question wins the round, and two rounds wins the match.<br/><br/>The winner of the game plays the Money Cards, which offers up to $32,000 in winnings. Unlike most of the late-1980s run, there is no car game.<br/><br/>While using the logo of the 2001 revival, the format is that of the 1970s and 1980s runs. As a result, it does not resemble the 2001 format in any way.<br/><br/>The &quot;Second Edition&quot;, released in 2020, is based on the currently-airing 2019 ABC revival hosted by Joel McHale, and featuring McHale on the box art. The game plays much like the original format, but the front game is shortened to a single 5-question round, with each player having to flip a row of 7 cards (10 in the first season) to win and take $10,000 to the Money Cards, which now also uses a single 7-card line and no money add-ons but can bring the player's winnings to $640,000. And like the revival, the player uses &quot;poker chips&quot; (cardboard markers with poker chip designs) to keep track of their winning s during the Money Cards round.<br/><br/>",

        "description": "Attack The Pack is a card game that replicates the experience of a pro bike race from your jersey pocket. It can be played at home, at the coffee stop or after dinner during a three-week grand tour...<br/><br/>In Attack The Pack you deploy a team of riders against your opponents to attack the peloton, create a winning breakaway and finally take on that agonizing sprint to the finish. Will you collude with your opponents, backing them up until the final sprint? Will you conspire against them, building an alliance and leaving them trailing in your wake? Or will you just go hell-for-leather from the starting line, trusting everyone else to do the dirty work?<br/><br/>Whatever you choose, that&rsquo;s only the beginning of the challenge! The course itself, weather conditions and individual moments of brilliance from riders make Attack The Pack as beautifully unforgiving as real racing. The game is for 2-4 players and lasts approx 20min.<br/><br/>Gameplay:<br/>Each player has a team of up to five riders played in front of them, at the start of the game everyone is the peloton. Each rider has stats for four different road types (Flat Road, Hill, Moutain &amp; Cobbles) which can be changed at any time during the game. To win you need to have a rider with the highest stat number for the current road type at the end of the game, ideally in the break. Players choose to make an attack with their riders and other players can either join the attack or defend against it. The break is created by the difference in the attacking players and the defending players, which would be then counted in minutes. The riders in the break would be moved forward in front of the riders in the peloton to signify they are in the break.<br/><br/>Players then use cards to change the break, attack and join the break, or reel the break in and everyone is back in the peloton. Other cards will help and hinder riders, including changing their stats.<br/><br/>When deck runs out, then players enter the Sprint Finish, and every player gets one turn to try and change the outcome of the game and win!<br/><br/>",

        "description": "For about 1800 years many Roman cities had four-horse chariot races almost daily. They were popular with the rich and poor. There was pageantry, favorite factions (defined by the colors worn by the drivers), and substantial wagering. Table-top chariot races have been popular at board and miniature game conventions for years as well as with a group of friends. Circus Maximus for Miniatures distills the best features of these games, focusing on quick play with rules that include player aids, charts and examples of play, so that players can focus on the action.<br/><br/>During setup, each player uses a dry-erase marker to track their team on a laminated Driver&rsquo;s Log. A team is defined by the Weight of its Chariot, the Speed and Endurance of its Horses, and the Skill of its Driver. A lighter Chariot and Team is faster, but more easily damaged than a heavy one. Players eventually develop their team preferences, favoring light, speedy chariots with an emphasis on better die rolls, or sturdy Heavy chariots that can dish out damage.<br/><br/>Each race involves three laps around the track. During a turn, chariots are selected for action by a random pull of a colored d6 (matching the Chariot&rsquo;s color,) then roll 2d6 for movement. The selected team and may choose to move, attack, move, attack again and Block. In addition to avoiding damage caused by opposing teams, a team must not enter corners with too quickly, as disaster lurks. Players record actions and results on every turn. The most used rules and tables are printed on the reverse of the Driver&rsquo;s Log, with additional rules printed on cards for quick event resolution. Each turn is a raucous affair, as nearly every Chariot/Team is passed, attacked, or dodged.<br/><br/>The game comes complete with a large track (designed to fit 15mm chariot and team miniatures), counters for each of 12 colors of Chariot in all three Weights, and other Counters to keep track of laps, chariot speed. (movement), and the occasional wreck or running driver. The game and it&rsquo;s components fit on a 30 x 96-inch table.  Both unpainted and painted Miniatures are offered as options.<br/><br/>Big Board Games also offers 15mm miniatures of chariots and four-horse teams typical of the ones used by the Romans.  They are offered as unpainted and unassembled, as well as painted and assembled.<br/><br/>",

In the standard 4-player form of the game, the game has two teams - the fielding team and the batting team. On the fielding team one player takes the role of the bowler while the other takes the fielder role. On the batting team the two players each take the role of the batsmen.  The batting team will have ten overs to score runs, unless the bowling team can take ten wickets first. The team with the highest score wins.<br/><br/>How it works: The game contains three decks of cards; batting, bowling, fielding. Each over, the batter, the bowler and fielder receive a new set of possible deliveries(bowling cards), shot options (batting cards) and field positions (field cards).<br/>The bowler will try to restrict runs, bowl the batter or appeal for LBW. The batter will try to smash a six. But no, you'll only be able to get a single off that one.<br/><br/>There are optional rules for a two-player game.<br/><br/>The game is broadly speaking a trick-taking card game where the player controlling the batsman tries to follow suit and play a lower-valued card than the bowler.  Play then moves on to the fielder who tries to follow suit and play a card that's equal in value to the batting card played.<br/> Home Page: <a target='_blank' href=\"http://homepages.slingshot.co.nz/~ckc/index.htm\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer noopener\">http://homepages.slingshot.co.nz/~ckc/index.htm</a><br/><br/>",

        "description": "Timeline: Korean History, a card game in Timeline series, consists of 110 cards that depict various historical events in Korean history. Each card has two identical sides, except that one of them shows the year that the particular event happened.<br/><br/>Players take turns placing a card from their hand in a row on the table. After placing the card, the player reveals the year on it. If the card was placed correctly with the year in chronological order with all other cards on the table, the card stays in place; otherwise, the card is removed from play and the player takes another card from the deck.<br/><br/>The first player to get rid of all their cards by placing them correctly wins. If multiple players go out in the same round, then everyone else is eliminated from play and each of those players are dealt one more card for another round of play. If only one player has no cards after a bonus round, that player wins; otherwise, play continues until a single player goes out.<br/><br/>",

Eleven states are key swing states, the same states that were considered &quot;battleground states&quot; in the 2004 election.<br/>    Larger states tend to stay undecided through most of the game keeping the final outcome in doubt until the very end.

Different character types have different strengths and weaknesses, and each player starts with a different Quest card explaining exactly what objects and locations must be found in order to obtain the Moonsword.  Players then wander the board battling monsters, acquiring objects and drawing random event cards.  The first person to meet the quest goals, obtain the Moonsword, and find their hidden magic gate is the winner.<br/><br/>",

Like similar word games, you don't need to be a mastermind to be good at it.<br/><br/>You can learn the rules in a few minutes. Here are most of the rules:<br/><br/>1 Draw 20 tiles at random, pick the 10 you like best and put them on your row #1 (the row facing you)<br/>2 Roll 2 dice, select one and move a tile that many spaces in a straight line. Save the other one to use later.<br/>3 Your opponent does the same. As your letters move together, you can form words with either player's letters.<br/><br/>You score based on how far away from your home row the letters are, times the length of the word.  There are blank tiles and a special * tile, used to replace any letter.  The * tile can only be used by the player who owns it; the blanks can be used by either player.  There are a couple of other simple rules involving capture of letter tiles, but you get the idea.<br/><br/>The board and pieces are made of hardwood and are laser engraved.

Each card displays a letter, which becomes a different letter with a different point value when the card is rotated 180 degrees. The instructions include rules for:<br/>i) The Final Word, in which two players take turns forming words from a selection of 12 cards. The player who forms the final word keeps the cards that were used to form it. Twelve more cards are drawn; the process is repeated; and the player with more cards after four rounds wins;<br/>ii) Finders Stealers, in which 3 to 6 players each play two cards simultaneously face up onto the table. The player who is able to form the longest word within 30 seconds keeps the cards used to form that word, and the player with the most cards after three rounds wins;<br/>iii) Word Wars I.II.III, which has its own BGG entry; and<br/>iv) Solitaire Dare, in which each of five columns contains ten overlapping cards, with only the bottom card in each column face up.

These actions will vary slightly depending upon the last number &quot;called&quot;.<br/><br/>At the end of a round, players score points for their place in getting their first bingo; numbers circled; and tens-digits of numbers circled.

Whoever has contributed the highest value of building stones to the construction of a building receives points upon its completion. At the beginning of each turn, dice are rolled to determine which building stone will be delivered to which city gate. The players try to block each other's paths in the city with their carts in order to be faster than the others.

To set up, shuffle the 28 double-sided trail cards, flipping half the deck repeatedly to randomize which sides are face up, then lay out the cards in a trail with the Golden Ei inn card at one end and the Fox at the other. Place the bunnies 8-10 spaces away from the fox depending on how difficult you want the game to be, with each bunny on their own card.<br/><br/>To start, roll the die, then move the matching colored bunny (blue, red, yellow) forward one space. Next, choose the closest vacant trail card either in front of or behind the bunny just moved, then flip it. If the card shows 1-2 eggs in yellow, red, or blue, move the matching bunny forward 1-2 spaces, then once again flip over the closest vacant trail card either in front of or behind the bunny just moved. If you instead reveal 1-3 fox paws, move the fox forward 1-3 spaces, then pass the die to the next player, who rolls the die to start a new turn.<br/><br/>If the fox lands on a bunny, you lose, but if any bunny first lands on the inn, then they all reach safety!<br/><br/>Golden Ei includes six helper cards, such as a dice squirrel and a taxi stork, that you can add to the game. You start only 6-8 spaces away from the fox, but each helper animal provides a one-time benefit that will ideally keep you out of the fox's jaws.<br/><br/>",

All prototypes submitted must conform to the technical and style requirements, fixed components and a given theme which changes every year. Everybody can join the contest and this is a great opportunity for emerging game designers to see their idea published.<br/>For more information:<br/>giocoinedito@luccacomicsandgames.com<br/><a target='_blank' href=\"http://www.luccacomicsandgames.com\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer noopener\">www.luccacomicsandgames.com</a><br/><br/>There are no unsolvable mysteries for the Zoo Police detectives! <br/>The Zoo Police know no impossible crimes, but when they are perpetrated by Zebras and Rhinos, they sure are unlikely crimes! Framing the real culprits will be a challenge!<br/>1 &ndash; Play your Suspects in secret.<br/>2 &ndash; Score points by guessing the other players&rsquo; Suspects.<br/>3 &ndash; Get the Crime cards up for grabs, but watch out: you can only keep three types!<br/>Who will be the best &ldquo;zoocop&rdquo;?<br/><br/>In Zoo Police every player is an animal-policeman. At the beginning of each round there are formed four rows of Crimes represented by cards. Each row may consist of one or several cards. When the Crimes are known the players place their Suspect cards simultaneously face-down one card per row. Now we're moving to the guessing phase. Each player in her turn gets one guess and says what's the value (from 1 to 5) of chosen opponent's Suspect card. If the guess is right the Suspect is removed and the player who guessed correctly receives a point card. If the guess is wrong the card stays face-up and nothing happens. When each card is turned face-up or removed the Crime phase occurs. The player that placed the highest Suspect card in each row gets the appropriate row of Crime card(s). In case of a tie the tied cards are removed and the next high wins if any.<br/><br/>After several rounds the players score the points for the best three types of Crime cards that they gathered plus the bonuses for right guessing. The player who scored the most points is the winner.<br/><br/>",

Many centuries ago humans encountered other sentient &ndash; yet alien &ndash; races, but only Kalmians were as aggressive and as technologically advanced as the descendants of the inhabitants of Earth. In the remote outer rim of the universe Tellurians and Kalmians keep fighting in their spaceships for domination. In those fierce and deadly skirmishes only a few things really count: commanders&rsquo; skills to maneuver huge astral vessels, the ability to foresee your opponent&rsquo;s next move as well as wise management of energy in different ship sectors and proper assignment of power to shields and laser cannons.<br/><br/>Only one ship shall leave this accursed vastness of space, while the burnt-out wreck of its rival shall remain here as a warning to all enemies or a prized loot for lucky scrappers...<br/><br/>Outer Rim is a simple and quick, science-fiction battle game for two players. One player commands the starship of Tellurians, while the other player becomes the captain of the star vessel belonging to the alien race of Kalmians. Players wage a deadly duel in the cosmic space. Victory depends on proper allocation of energy around the starship, a little luck when rolling dice and smart use of special abilities of modules and crews.<br/><br/>The battle ends when one of the starships has two sectors destroyed. The commander of such vessel loses and his opponent wins!<br/><br/>",

General Sharon's Ugda (an Israeli Division) leads the offensive into Egypt and in a hard fought set of small fights ends up cutting off the Egyptian 3rd Army.<br/><br/>Armored Knights: Operation Gazelle the battle of the Israeli offensive to cross the Suez Canal and invade Africa and cut off the Egyptian Army elements that were on the east side of the canal. This game focuses on combat at the battalion level on a scale that makes representing large battles real fun. It will also have its own innovative and unique way to handle the combat mutlipliers for engineers, anti-tank, intelligence, and recon elements. The players will find this does not always work the way they want and the support troops sometimes fail to do the mission they are assigned to do. They might even have a detrimental effect.  Both players will be challenged from the start of the battle.  The Egyptians will find that counter-attacking is very difficult as the higher command did not beleive what they were told about the Israeli positions on the west bank of the Suez Canal.  The Israelis will find that getting across the canal is one thing, holding the crossing is another, and spreading out across the west bank is another still.  Players will be rewarded for mixing the different combat support elements to enhance each attack or defense.  As happened during the battle the Israelis will find it very hard to attack Egyptian infantry alone or against their anti-tank screens.  Six scenarios are available to play the whole battle through the cutting off of the Egyptian 3rd Army, or just some important parts dealing with the attacks on Ismailia or Suez City.<br/><br/>This game comes with:<br/>    (8) 11x17 Color Map Sections<br/>    (4) Color Order of Battle Cards<br/>    Approximately 600 Die Cut Counters<br/><br/>(from publisher's website)<br/><br/>",

Meanwhile, everybody else will try to intuit your answers and, more importantly, also which silhouettes you have chosen to represent them.<br/><br/>When it is your turn, you will answer one of two randomly drawn conundrums. To do this you will have eight of your ten silhouettes to pick from. For each of the three questions that make up your conundrum you will secretly decide on the best and the worst answer from your point of view. Question by question, everyone else will try to guess your favorite answer. Whenever someone is correct, both you and that player will get a point. However, if a player mistakenly thinks that your least favorite answer might be your favorite one, that player loses one point. The game ends when everyone has had the same amount of turns.

As no one starts the game with cards, everyone must collect from the grid on their first turn.<br/><br/>Collect card(s) from the row and column that the chef's hat is on. If there are multiple matching cards, you get to take all of them (as long as it doesn't take you over 7 cards in your hand!). Draw new cards to replace the card(s) you collect, and move the chef's hat token to a newly placed card. All cards, apart from the card underneath the chef's hat, are face up. Instead of selecting the available face up cards, players can choose to take the mystery face down card underneath the chef's hat.<br/><br/>Collect the biggest sets, while cunningly moving the chef's hat to stop other players grabbing the pasta they want. Create the same set as another player and you can shout &quot;Pass the Pasta&quot; and steal one of their cards... but be careful not to lose points by making things too al dente! Whenever you bank less than 3 cards, you must take the al dente token and place it in front of you.<br/><br/>The game ends as soon as the draw pile runs out. Each banked card is worth 1 point at the end of the game. The player with the al dente token must minus 2 points from their score. Whoever has the most points, wins!<br/><br/>-description from publisher<br/><br/>",

An older player reads a story and when any of the figures is named, each player tries to be the first to grab it. If the figure has already been named, the player takes a marker instead.  At the end of the story the player with the most pieces wins.<br/><br/>In the second game, the pieces are laid out in an order and the player must identify them to get a point.<br/><br/>The last game is one of remembering which pieces have been named.<br/><br/>It is similar to the earlier Ratz-Fatz and some of the scenarios can be used to make a larger combined game, so in some ways this is an expansion kit.<br/><br/>Integrates with:<br/><br/>    Ratz-Fatz<br/><br/><br/>",

One player will play as Talibans, the other as a group of Polish soldiers who get ambushed by the Afghans.<br/><br/>Before the game each player will pick several characters that will represent his forces. The goal of the game is to gain victory points by killing the opponents characters. Stronger characters will be of more use during the game but will also give the opponent more points once killed.<br/><br/>The game lasts four rounds and each round last three phases:<br/><br/>- Straighten + draw phase<br/>Each player straightens his characters so he can use them in the new round. Also each player draws cards until they have four cards in hand.<br/><br/>- Action phase<br/>In the action phase players can perform actions until both of them decide to pass. For an action they can play a card from their hand (events or attachments), use an ability of a character or shoot using one of their characters. Each character can shoot once per action phase. <br/>When a character shoots players form an &quot;exchange fire&quot; pool by adding into it two &quot;miss&quot; cards and as many &quot;hit&quot; cards as is indicated on the shooting characters card. Now players can manipulate the &quot;exchange fire&quot; pool by playing cards that add either &quot;hit&quot; or &quot;miss&quot; cards. When both players don't want to play anymore cards they randomly pick one card from the pool.

As the Pharaoh falls ill, the possible heirs to the throne each builds a pyramid for the Pharaoh. The player who builds the biggest and tallest pyramid shall be the next Pharaoh.<br/><br/>In the game of Colorful Pyramid, you build a four-tier pyramid with stone cards.<br/><br/>There are 64 stone cards in the game, each of which has a color and a number. At the beginning of the game, each player has four stone cards in front of them as bottom tier of their pyramid.<br/><br/>Each turn, you may take one stone card from the six revealed cards. To do so, you must use the power of your stones. Rotate or discard at least two of your cards so that the bottom digit of the total of these cards is equal to the number of the card to be taken.<br/><br/>When you add a stone at second tier or above, look at the two stones immediately below it. Both must share its color or number with the stone to be added.<br/><br/>Instead of taking a stone card, you may rest and return all your rotated stones to upright position.<br/><br/>You win the game when you have made a perfect four-tier pyramid. When the stone deck runs out, the player whose pyramid is closest to perfect is the winner.<br/><br/>Your goal is simple: complete a four-tier pyramid, but to do so, you have many aspects to consider. You must plan ahead, or other players will go ahead of you. Watching your stones built into a colorful pyramid will satisfy your eyes.<br/><br/>Publisher's summary<br/>ピラミッドを４段まで積み上げる単純明快な目的ですが色と数字の縛りが効いており考え所はたくさんです。計画的に石を購入しなければ兄弟（他のプレイヤー）達に先を越されてしまうでしょう。石を積み上げていく視覚的充足感は楽しさを彩ってくれるでしょう！<br/><br/>",

Armed with a sword, two axes, throwing knives, and a pistol, she jumped out of the Buckingham&rsquo;s Palace window, straight into the darkness of the night. The rumours say that the queen was bored and decided to conquer a new colony &ndash; Hell itself. There must be something going on because London is getting quite&hellip; hot. And there are more and more infernal hounds around and no one to clean after them. And more infernal chasms&hellip; and portals&hellip; Whew!<br/><br/>It sounds like a true adventure.<br/><br/>Penny Dreadfun: Second Edition will take you to the year 1888, to Victorian England, full of occultism, British humour, and more or less historical characters. You play as one of many unusual heroes, who &ndash; driven by various motives &ndash; set off to the city to find the source of disaster and save the world,  which is becoming more and more taken over by forces of hell.<br/><br/>Join The Adventure<br/><br/>Action-packed adventure with British humour: Penny 2nd Edition offers various game modes &ndash; story driven campaign, co-op boss rush mode and an open world experience.

Also the fights driven by the PD card system are simple, dynamic and they plays just like rolling dices but without randomness!<br/><br/>New approach to move and board mechanics<br/><br/>With each round the world known to us (or at least to those who are well over 120 years old) is getting more and more infernal. This will be reflected in the constantly changing board with playable 3D elements.

Each player has six octagonal and five square playing pieces and plays with either the black or the red pieces. To start the game each player's pieces are placed on the nearest two 'rows' to that player, on the spaces the same shape as the pieces. The object of the game is to get any one of your own playing pieces onto the opponent's back row.<br/><br/>All the playing pieces can move onto either the octagonal or the squared shaped spaces, however they can only move forward, not sideways or backwards. It should be noted that as the squared shaped spaces do not touch each other, a player cannot move directly from one squared shaped space to another. In addition, octagonal shaped pieces can capture any of the opponent's pieces standing on octagonal shaped spaces and squared shaped pieces can capture any of the opponent's pieces standing on square shaped spaces. Considering its simplicity, the game can develop in a surprising variety of ways. For example, pieces of both players may bunch up on one side of the board, several 'skirmishes' may occur all over the board, or a large stand off may arise across the center of the board. This variety adds to the attractiveness of the play.<br/><br/>",

The player whose dragon overcomes the attacks and stands tallest when the cards run out wins.<br/><br/>The game is a simple building challenge. The cards are coasters, with slits in them, so you can slide them together and they'll hold fast fairly well - at least until the whole thing comes crashing down.<br/><br/>You won't lose the game (necessarily) if that happens - the game isn't over until all the cards are played. That's a nice change of pace from most dexterity games, where a crash is a loss.<br/><br/>&mdash;user summary<br/><br/>",

Study the form (different for each race), check the odds (favorites don't always win) and place your bets! Betting chips are provided so you don't have to bet with real money.<br/><br/>Fortunes to be won or lost! By studying the odds you may have more chance of winning -but, just as in real life, the outsiders can take the race -so a lucky name or number, a whim or a fancy, can sometimes serve you just as well!<br/><br/>The &quot;Dogs&quot; run against the turn of a set of specially formulated cards which automatically adjust the odds and form, which is determined before every race, so that the outcome of each race is as predictable (and unpredictable) as in the real world of dog racing.<br/><br/>Each race lasts around 5-8 minute. There are 10 races per card but you can play as many races as you like as each is excitingly different and unpredictable.<br/><br/>This really is an exciting game and you don't know the outcome of each race until the last card is played!&quot;<br/><br/>Brief Notes:<br/><br/>Fast and interesting wagering game. Since you can play as many races as you want, it can be as quick as 10 minutes, or an all evening game if you wish.<br/><br/>",

The Sultan's absolute reign has lasted 33 years and he has no intent to surrender his power. He controls his entire Empire using the spy network he created. He suspect the Young Turks would dethrone him. thus, the Sultan rules the Empire and paranoia rules the Sultan.<br/><br/>In İttihat, there are 3 factions: The Unionists, the Sultan Abdulhamid II and his Spies, and (with at least seven players) and the Separatists. In the game, the roles of unionists and spies are hidden, while the player who plays the Sultan has his card face up. Other players build their strategies without seeing each others' roles. Players bid for control of key provinces, some of which grant military strength. The Unionist players win if their side controls four of the of the provinces in play at the end of the game or when they stage a successful coup. The Separatist player wins if no other faction controls four provinces at the end of the game. Otherwise, the faction of the Sultan and of the Spies wins.<br/><br/>",

We can assure you that everything you see in Ahotnik is related to the fictional world we created for our game. The only place we can accept fighting and war is in a boardgame, other than that, as authors, players and human beings, we strongly reject war and violence and we firmly stand for peace and inclusivity.<br/><br/><br/>In Ahotnik, the players form pairs and act as the pilots of giant robots called &ldquo;Ahotniks&rdquo;&mdash;each of which has its own unique designation of &ldquo;OXO-##&rdquo;, for this reason, they are also known as &ldquo;OXOs&rdquo;. Their goal is to be the first team to eliminate a rival Ahotnik. But, during their battles, otherworldly creatures referred to as &ldquo;Demons&rdquo; emerge from mysterious Portals and try to wreak havoc on Earth by destroying the Ahotniks. The teams must fight on both fronts if they are going to be the one to bring glory to their nation! But beware: Your thirst for power must not come at the cost of total global annihilation&hellip;<br/><br/>A game of Ahotnik is played over a series of rounds which are divided into 4 phases:<br/><br/><br/>     Pilot Phase:<br/> Pilot pairs try to coordinate by using their Action tiles, which represent the cerebral commands they send to the Ahotnik. The success of their strategy depends on their level of synchrony. <br/>     Ahotnik Phase:<br/> The Ahotniks operate in this phase depending on the actions thought up by the pilots in the Pilot Phase. In order, the OXOs will carry out:<br/>         Tactical Actions: A set of actions that can have offensive, defensive, or strategic effects.<br/>         Movement Actions: Move the OXO on the game board.<br/>         Attack Actions: The main (though not the only) method to damage your enemies.<br/>    <br/>     Demon Phase:<br/>Beware of incoming threats! This is the turn of any Demons in play. The Radar will also indicate if any new Portals open and increase the Global Threat Level this turn.<br/>     Recovery Phase:<br/>Certain game elements are restored so a new round may begin. <br/><br/><br/>Rounds are repeated until an Ahotnik falls victim to another OXO or a Demon.

Over the course of a turn, you roll a die to determine if you get to mutate, and then move to run away from predators.<br/><br/>Mutation is easier if you are in a warm climate. And if you are lucky enough to get a mutation card, you will either evolve, or pick up some mutation which can affect your movement or mutation abilities.<br/><br/>At the end of your turn, you flip up a card which lets you move and introduce certain type of new predators, evolve predators, and move continents.<br/><br/>Yes, the continents drift around the board, offering you chances to break a land bridge to strand your opponents on a plate along with a few hungry dinosaurs. Or drift yourself southward to bask and mutate in the sun.<br/><br/>The only other twist is that predators can only eat during certain player evolutionary stages. So trying not to mutate can be a very good idea at certain stages of the game. Being eaten costs you an evolutionary stage-so picking on the leader can help keep the game even.<br/><br/>",

These points are expended when units move or fight and also just to maintain a unit's existence. They're moved from the ports to the forward battle area and require record keeping.<br/><br/>This game's supply system portrays the situation that existed. Even if you're just digging in and awaiting an attack, you still need supplies flowing to your troops to feed (and water) them. Also, because all units must be able to trace supply to exist, players are rewarded well when successfully able to cut off enemy units from their rear areas. You can even capture enemy supply depots that are located too close to the front.<br/><br/>It can be linked with the game La Regia Marina, also published by Simulations Canada. When playing this way, the available number of operations points is based on how well you manage your fleets and convoys in La Regia Marina rather than the fixed supply schedule that comes with D.A.K.<br/><br/>One full map is divided into Eastern map and Western map.  The whole map covers from Damascus to Casablanca.  This is one of the widest map of this theatre, I think.<br/><br/>",

You may re-roll any die that has not landed special side up as often as you like. Sooner or later though you will roll two chinchillers and have to close an eye.<br/><br/>Once both your eyes are closed, you can not re-roll any dice any more when it is your turn again. Instead, your left neighbor will tell you what you have rolled after just one roll. Your neighbor will also be the one who will have to pay for any sand you are scoring while blind. As a result, there is a good chance your neighbor will try to cheat you. It will be up to you to either accept your neighbor's word blindly or to try to catch them in the act. However, if you are greedy while your neighbor is telling the truth, you will be the one losing precious sand.<br/><br/>&mdash;description from the publisher<br/><br/>",

Any number of players can play simultaneously as all players use the same die results.<br/><br/>Players draw areas such as neighborhoods, businesses, factories, farms, and parks that each score in different ways along with drawing the roads to connect them all. Each game is made different by the inclusion of a set of special building cards that can be drawn under special circumstances for big points. These special buildings help direct players into a strategy.<br/><br/>But you must be careful when drawing. Certain types of roads and buildings generate waste and when you get too wasteful, an opponent can fill up one of your empty spaces with an unusable junk pile!<br/><br/>Since any number of players can play at a time, Scribbletown is a a great &ldquo;thinky filler&rdquo;&ndash;it plays in around thirty minutes, but has a ton of heavy tradeoffs without a lot of setup or teardown time.

The game depicts this conflict at a strategic level, with most operational and tactical details represented by fast and easy-to-play systems, rather than intricate mechanics. The intent of the game is to provide a broad overview of the historical events while being fun to play. The object of the game for the Japanese player is to control the sea areas around Japan to prevent Russian combatants from bombarding and cutting off supplies to the island nation, and to destroy the naval forces of Russia. The object of the game for the Russian player is to disrupt Japanese sea control, retain sea control around the Russian and Manchurian coastline for as long as possible, and destroy Japanese naval forces. Both players must obtain their objectives by deploying their naval resources into the sea areas on the map, earning victory points at the end of each of six turns for areas under their control, and for opposing units destroyed.<br/><br/>Setting Sun, Rising Sun owes its original inspiration to War at Sea, designed by Jon Edwards and Don Greenwood and published by The Avalon Hill Game Company, a game which covered the war in the Atlantic in World War Two. Setting Sun, Rising Sun borrows a number of concepts from this earlier game as a starting point, such as area movement, individual capital ships, battle line resolutions, and rolling sixes to hit, and then diverges significantly to reflect the Russo-Japanese War situation. The game includes about 280 counters, a 22&quot;x28&quot; map sheet of the combat areas including charts and tables, and a set of rules to play the game.<br/><br/>",

        "description": "Assault on Tobruk is a game type simulation of the successful assault by German and Italian forces in North Africa lead by Erwin Rommel on the Allied held fortress of Tobruk in the summer of 1942 ... [It] has an historic scenario and six alternate scenarios covering the actual and potential events at Tobruk. After choosing a scenario one player takes command of the Allied forces and the other player the Axis forces.<br/><br/>Each turn represents 2 hours, each hex is 650 meters, and counters represent company size units.<br/><br/>Description from &ldquo;The SimCan Newsletter&rdquo; #2 Fall 1980<br/><br/>From March to December of 1941, the forces of Rommel&rsquo;s Africa Korps surrounded the Allied held fortress of Tobruk in North Africa but were unable to subdue it.  On 20 June 1942, Rommel got another chance to cut off Tobruk as the Allies retreated from the loss of the Gazala battles.  This time Tobruk fell and it did so in a swirling action lasting less than a day.  Assault on Tobruk depicts this situation.<br/><br/>The map covers the the entire fortress of Tobruk past its perimeter strongpoints in hexes equalling about 670 meters across.  Double impulse turns represent 2 hours and most units are of company size.  Seven scenarios are provided, one of the historic and the other six examining the various effects of improved Allied command control tactics and artillery coordination as well as alternate attack plans for Axis forces.  Assault on Tobruk is a fast playing game of low complexity showing an assault that could very easily have come out differently.<br/><br/>",

The alcohol is all gone, and it is up to you to give the people what they want! Challenge up to four of your friends as you each race to collect enough sets of booze to satisfy the populace of a roaring American city and catch a sweet ride to get there. Just remember, the first one there gets the business while the others get caught! Use your connections with the crime families and famous gangsters to sabotage your opponents and bolster your own operation. And if you&rsquo;re feeling lucky, your whole situation could change with the roll of the dice using the exciting underground casino cards!<br/><br/>This simple to learn, competitive game for two to five players is a great way to liven up any game night. No two games are ever the same as you strive to pull off the most profitable bootleg operation each round!<br/><br/>The game is played by drawing two new cards from the deck on each turn. You may then take up to three actions playing action / casino cards, placing a booze card into your collection or cash / action card (for cash value) in your bank, or buying one of three cards from the shared Speakeasy. Additionally, you may use an entire turn (don't draw or take any other actions) to purchase either a vehicle or drop-off location. Make sure you have plenty of cash in the bank because if you don't, other Bootleggers can take booze from your collection as payment for actions taken against you!<br/><br/>The first Bootlegger to have three full sets of booze in their collection, a vehicle, and a drop-off location satisfies their city's craving first to win the whole round! Play can be extended by tracking the total value of the winning Bootlegger's haul and compete to be the first to a pre-set value.<br/><br/>",

Players bet their hard-earned monies in the hope of buying the perfect cards to crush their enemies, but goblins are always hiding just out of sight to cause all sorts of mischief! Bet, bribe, and battle your way through the marketplace and the arena to become the King of the Creepies!<br/><br/>Each round of the game is played in three phases. In the market phase, players buy and sell cards to try to assemble a team of well-equipped creepies. In the match phase, players reveal their chosen combatants, then bet their monies on the outcome; after bets have been placed, a mischief card is drawn, which affects the battle in an unpredictable way. The battle phase is where the majority of the game takes place. Players battle each other using one of thirty unique creepies, using gear, items, and special abilities to help their cause. The winner earns a victory crystal, and whoever collects five crystals first wins!<br/><br/>The game includes a variant ruleset for &quot;poker mode&quot;. In this version of the game, players draw an entirely new hand each round and go through a series of rounds of betting before battle, with the combat winner gaining the pot. Players then draw a whole new hand and try again until one player has all the monies!<br/><br/>",

They can each play up to three Character cards in front of them, forming their party of mythological heroes.  As they play their cards on their turns, they draw from a common deck to replenish their hands.  Players can play Monster cards on their parties, challenging the monsters with their heroes, or pit the creature against one of another player's heroes.  Dice are rolled and Assistance cards played to help either heroes or monsters.  The side with the higher resultant value wins the battle, eliminating the opposing cards from play.<br/><br/>Each monster is worth a score to its vanquisher, and each defeated hero penalizes its player.  When a player has accumulated a predetermined score (which depends on the number of players), he or she wins the game.<br/><br/>",

The game depicts the various areas of potential conflict on a series of maps scaled to about 24 miles to a hex. The interactions of surface, subsurface, and naval air forces are depicted by silhouette style counters. The data base of Seapower &amp; the State, our strategic modern naval game, is used for the unit<br/>values, thus providing a degree of mateability between the games. The operational nature of the game is emphasized by five-hour turns and a simple but effective combat system that reflects the lethality of modern weapons systems. A number of scenarios are provided for likely conflict areas as well as a system to use Seapower &amp; the State as a campaign game scenario generator.<br/><br/>&mdash;description from the publisher<br/><br/>",

        "description": "A game of man-to-man urban combat in World War II featuring German, Russian, and American forces. Each turn is fifteen seconds and each square is 10 feet across.<br/><br/>From the rulebook: &quot;The game is designed to recreate, as close as possible, the 'feel' and 'flavor' of infantry combat and the problems and decisions faced by the small unit leader . . . The combat units involved represent the average organizations of the U.S., Germany, and the U.S.S.R. The playing area represents typical European buildings and streets. All names on the maps are in German, but represent typical small town architecture and street plans left over from the Middle Ages . . . Proceed with caution: the town is unfriendly, the enemy is experienced and your men aren't expendable. You have your mission and your organization. As soon as you read the rules and set-up, it will be H-HOUR.&quot;<br/><br/>From designer's William A. Comito's comments in the rulebook: &quot;A game is one man's view of a particular subject, and is only as good as the author's research and experience. I designed this game from the viewpoint of a professional soldier who has spent 6+ years in the infantry, including two combat tours, and who has been an instructor in small unit tactics and map reading. My training has been in all aspects of infantry combat, and my research has included not only books but interviews with combat infantry veterans of WWII . . . The game is, honestly, an attempt to combine a miniatures game and a boardgame together. Most of the rules are written from a boardgame viewpoint, but can be readily applied to miniatures.&quot;<br/><br/>",

Thematically, it is uses elements from a television series of the same name.  Players assume the roles of Wickie and his friends as they race each other to board a Viking ship.<br/><br/>Each player selects a character and takes four tokens.  They play their turns by first rolling the dice.  There are four lanes to reach the ship.  The squares (of which some are colored) on the lanes are printed with the faces of a die.  A player can move his or her token to the next square if one of the rolled dice matches the square's.  If the token moves onto a colored square, it can jump once to the next square of the same color.  Each character can take a short at certain points along the path.  As each square cannot accommodate more than one token, blocking is possible.  However, a token can jump across blocking pieces if the player has a die that matches the square at the opposite side of a block.<br/><br/>The game ends when one player gets all four of his or her tokens aboard the viking ship at the end, making him or her the winner.<br/><br/>",

In &quot;Transpose,&quot; be the first to exit 8 checkers off the board, but watch out... some opposing pieces may switch places with yours! In &quot;Peregrine,&quot; circumnavigate the board's perimeter to bring 5 checkers to the exit point; they can travel as stacks to advance more quickly, but also risk greater setbacks. In &quot;Upper Hand,&quot; cover or capture all opponent pieces. And in &quot;Amazons,&quot; block in the opponent's four pieces with arrows: where an arrow lands no move can cross, and each turn adds another block to the board. Four other good games, plus some solitaires, are included. Challenging and entertaining for 1 and 2 players, Ages 8 and up. &quot;<br/><br/>",

All playing pieces are in full view allowing the players to anticipate each strategic move.<br/><br/>Contents:<br/><br/>    1 Playing Board with 93 hexagon (six sided) shapes called Tangle Tiles.<br/>    116 Playing Pieces &ndash; 29 of each color.<br/>    4 Scoring Keys<br/>    4 Storage Trays<br/>    4 Scoring Rims<br/><br/><br/>Object Of Game:<br/>The object of the game is to have the highest total points when the game ends.<br/><br/>How To Score Points:<br/>1. When a player encloses all six sides of a Tangle Tile with his particular color playing pieces, he has captured that tile and scores points.<br/>2. Tangle playing pieces-values:<br/><br/>    Only the final piece that completes the surrounding of the Tangle Tile counts toward point value and only if all six sides of the Tangle Tile are surrounded by the same color.<br/><br/><br/>3. Each playing piece has its own point value.<br/>Note: There are six shapes from small to large point values are: 1, 2, 3, 4, 4, and 5 points.<br/>4. Tangle Tile values:<br/>The Tangle Tiles on the board also have point values, which are added to the value of the final playing piece that completes the surrounding of a Tangle Tile. These values are as follows:<br/><br/>    Plain Tile &ndash; 1 point.<br/>    Circular Design Tile &ndash; 2 points<br/>    Triangular Design Tile &ndash; 2 points plus double the value of the completing Tangle playing piece.<br/>    Square Design Tile &ndash; 4 points plus double the value of the completing Tangle playing piece.<br/><br/><br/>The Play:<br/>1. Each player&rsquo;s first turn must start with one side of his playing piece touching one of the six sides of the Center Star Tangle Tile.<br/>2. Players alternate turns.<br/>3. All pieces in play must be continuously connected (regardless of color) even when blocking.<br/>4. If a player places a playing piece on the board which does not complete a Tangle Tile his turn ends.<br/>5. A player is entitled to an immediate extra turn for every Tangle Tile he completely surrounds in his own color.<br/>6. Total points are kept on the scoring rim as each Tangle Tile is surrounded.<br/><br/>Conclusion Of Game:<br/>Play is ended when one player has used all his playing pieces or when one player has reached the total of 50 points.<br/><br/>Winner:<br/>The player with the highest total of points when the game ends.<br/><br/>Play For Partners:<br/>Partners sit facing each other. If Green and Blue pieces are on one team, points are scored for that team when tiles are surrounded 1. All in Green, 2. All in Blue, or 3. In Blue and Green.<br/><br/>",

The object of the game is the same: players take turns using weapons (both &quot;pivoting&quot; and &quot;forward firing&quot;, which amount to high-tech catapults and crossbows, respectively) to shoot projectiles at their opponent's forces. The prime target for these projectiles (and they are quite literally shot, using rubber-band powered mechanisms) are the five boundary sensors, which hide behind and around Protective Barriers and Battle Fortresses. The first to destroy all five wins.<br/><br/>However, unlike Crossbows and Catapults, the weapons in Immortals of Change can be built into different configurations. While additional combinations are possible, the base Battle Set promotes five different official combinations: Battle Falcon, Bull Rover, Big Strut, Battle Creeper, and Robot. Each combination has both strengths and weaknesses. Additional expansion sets allow even more formations, objectives, and scenarios.<br/><br/>From the box:<br/><br/>In a different time, enemy warriors will do battle using strange and menacing weapons. You are the commander of your forces, your opponent, the commander of his. Both commanders have great arsenals of weapons that convert from offensive to defensive weapons as the tides of battle change. But the one who possesses the greater skill and better strategy will conquer.<br/><br/>Immortals of Change - The fun is only limited by your imagination.<br/><br/>",

Included are 4 dragster Control Consoles, 88 play cards, 80+ counters, the track, dice, and four custom miniatures representing the dragsters.<br/><br/>This game plays a bit like &quot;Robo Rally lite,&quot; with players selecting cards in secret and arranging them in the order they are to be revealed to determine their dragsters' movement for the turn. The number of cards, from 1 to 3, each player selects, and when they are revealed, depends on the speed of his/her dragster, which generally increases from the start line. As dragsters collide with each other, they are knocked off course, and may rebound from the &quot;walls&quot; of the track. Each dragster has a supply of mines and missiles, as well as a certain amount of power for shields to deflect hits. Before the race starts, each player customizes his/her dragster with one secret piece of equipment which confers a special ability.<br/><br/>The winner is either the player to cross the finish line first, or the only player to survive the battling for position along the way.<br/><br/>This demo game was produced in a set of 150 and distributed at conventions to test the waters for a full-size Great Space Race game in the future.<br/><br/>Re-implemented as:<br/><br/>    The Great Space Race<br/><br/><br/>",

        "description": "This old game, designed by Captain William J. Chapman, an army pilot, is based on actual blind flying conditions. When &quot;flying the beam&quot;, the pilot hears a steady radio buzz when he is on his true course. If he flies to one side of the beam, he hears the Morse code letter &quot;A&quot; (.-); if to the other, the letter &quot;N&quot; (-.). As he nears the &quot;On Course&quot; signal, the letters &quot;A&quot; and &quot;N&quot; will superimpose on the &quot;On Course&quot; buzz in what's called the &quot;Twilight&quot; zones. Finally, as the pilot approaches the radio sending station adjacent to the airport, the signal fades out into what's called the &quot;Cone of Silence&quot;.<br/><br/>The object of the game is to land safely at the airport. Each player places his marker on the &quot;Leg&quot; of the beam nearest them. The start space tells you which lane (A, N, or center) your plane begins its approach on. On your turn, you spin the spinner and move your plane the number of spaces indicated towards the &quot;Cone of Silence&quot; in the center of the board. You must follow the directions for any space you land on (usually these cause you to shift lanes). When the &quot;Cone of Silence&quot; is reached, you spin for a runway number to land on. The first player to land by exact count on their assigned runway space wins.<br/><br/>",

It is advisable that at least one skipper knows the rudiments of sailing and yachting terms.&quot;<br/><br/>&quot;Although dice are used, there is a strong element of judgment in choosing the best course, when to change direction and when to risk hoisting your spinnaker - because the wind may change and catch you out.&quot;<br/><br/>Racing is carried out on a nautical chart - there is one supplied and other charts could be used - in conjunction with the acetate overlay grid supplied. Players design a course by using the marker pen to designate a start line and a number of buoys which define the course to be sailed.<br/><br/>The game seeks to emulate the tactics of a real yacht or dinghy race, with a pre-start period of jostling for position followed by the start gun. The wind direction is recorded on a compass rose marked on the acetate and is variable, by reference to a D12. Different tacks (e.g., running or beating) allow different distances to be traveled in a turn, again mirroring the tactics of a real race.<br/><br/>Real yacht-racing rules must be observed, including penalties for infringements. Advanced rules are provided for regattas and handicaps.<br/><br/>",

The 20,000 troops that Brazil sent to fight in Europe were completely integrated into the U.S. command structure.<br/>Early in the war Brazil was undecided to which side she would join - Axis or Allies? Both sides wooed her. However, by 1942 the U.S. and Brazilian navies were conducting joint naval and air patrols. This angered Hitler who ordered U-Boat attacks on Brazilian shipping. After a few high profile sinkings, the Brazilian public became enraged and Brazil declared war on Germany.<br/>Hitler was not impressed by this new threat. He was overheard to say that Brazil would actually send combat troops when &quot;snakes began smoking pipes.&quot; This inspired the FEB to begin calling themselves the SMOKING COBRAS.<br/><br/>",

        "description": "SPIES - The Sneaky Spy Game is a maze solving game.  It contains pads, pencils, card stands, 47 numbered cards, 10 spyglass cards, and 24 Spy Route Cards.<br/><br/>Each player takes a Spy Route Card and places it in a card stand so that he can see it, but no-one else can.  On each card is the route of a spy, starting from one of six embassies, passing through the Secret Service building, and progressing to a point where the Spy is caught.  Each route is 12 points long, passing through 12 of the 47 numbered points on the card.<br/><br/>The aim of the game is to determine the route of the spy on the card to your left.  Every turn you may ask the player on your left about one location on the Route Card.  This is done by the use of the number cards by:<br/>-  Taking the top card from the number deck and playing one card from what is then a hand of 5 (4 cards remain in the hand).<br/>-  Calling out the top card from the discard pile.<br/>-  Using a Spyglass card to ask about any location on the route.<br/><br/>When a number is called the player to the left checks the route and provides one of the following responses:<br/>-  If the number is on the spy's route then the sighting is &quot;Confirmed&quot;.<br/>-  If the number is adjacent to and in visual contact with the spy's route then the sighting is &quot;Witnessed&quot;.<br/>-  If it is neither of the above then there is &quot;No Sighting&quot;.<br/><br/>Information gained is marked accordingly on a Detector Pad.<br/><br/>At any time during a player's turn a player may try to guess the spy's route.  To do this he must call out the 12 numbers of a continuous route, in sequence, starting from the embassy to the spy's point of capture.  The first player to do this correctly is the winner.<br/><br/>",

A &quot;running back&quot; on a motorized cart carried the ball on running plays, bursting through a line of scrimmage consisting of figures placed on a pegboard &quot;scrimmage rack.&quot; The defense had &quot;linebackers&quot; mounted on wheeled carts that were propelled by hand toward the onrushing cart to tackle the runner. Violent collisions ensued - and were necessary to bring down the runner as the cart was quite powerful. Passes were attempted by positioning receiver figures down field, followed by the defense setting up coverage. The offensive player then tried to toss a Styrofoam football to one of the receivers using a passer/kicker figure with a spring-loaded arm. If the ball hit any part of a receiver it was a catch; hitting any part of a defender resulted in an interception. The passer/kicker also had a spring-loaded leg to attempt field goals, extra points, and kickoffs.<br/><br/>",

It is not intended to be comprehensive and cover every possible situation that could arise out of the U.S. civil war.  It is, rather, a playable game... a framework around which you can build as elaborate set of rules as you wish.&quot;...&quot;The game is extremely bloody.&quot;<br/>The game is intended for 1:1200 miniatures on a table top of at least 3' by 5'.  Each turn represents 5 minutes of real time, and ships move 1&quot; (100 yards) for every knot of speed.  Each ship gets a card with hit boxes for armor, speed, midships, stacks, draft, guns, and battering ram.  A ship is sunk when all draft boxes are gone.  Forts get similar cards.<br/>The rules are only about 12 pages, plus a couple more for charts, pictures and background data.  There are charts for penetrating and non-penetrating gunfire, critical hits, lucky hits, ramming, minefields, and loss of stack.  There are also three different turning circles.<br/><br/>",

Super Tank is more than just an expansion of SPI's game, however, it is a complete revision of the infantry rules.  Armored Vehicle rules are mostly in SPIs's rules folders for Tank.  The infantry in Super Tank are played sequentially while the vehicle and gun units remain simultaneous.  This makes large numbers of infantry easier to game...<br/><br/>The hexes on the large map are one inch to allow play with 1/285 miniatures.<br/><br/>The player will find that he has all the units he needs for all WWII types of attack and defense, including cavalry, machine guns, mortars, bridge laying AFV, rocket launchers and many other new types of units.  Super tank is truly a combined arms game.<br/><br/>Game components include one 34&quot; by 54&quot; map (!) two mini 11&quot; by 17&quot; plotting maps, two Terrain and combat tables, eight (!) 11&quot; by 14&quot; die cut counter sheets (448 infantry, 960 Armored Vehicles) one booklet of rules, and three zip Lock bags.<br/><br/>Game includes just about every tank made by anyone in WWII, each unit rated for Front, Side and Rear armor, as well as AP/HE factors, Range and Movement.

You fight with ground and air units, but you don&acute;t have atomic strike forces. There are two parties (red and blue), but you can play it with up to ten people, so that everybody can lead a part of the army. There is a large board, 80x150cm, with a painting on it, including power stations, railroads, roads, hills and rivers. Each party rules the following units: Commandos, Infantry, Recon, Grenade launchers, Engineers (Anti-mines and bridges), Tanks, Artillery, Flak, Minefields, Air-bases, Paratroops, Jet-fighters and bombers. Every unit has different move and battle strengths. You must coordinate your movements with the players in your team. A commander in staff will be elected, before the battle starts. First the units will be set-up face-down, so that your opponent can&acute;t see your troops. Every player has 100 numbers, to determine each unit on a small sheet of paper, showing the whole map. Unfortunately this game is not well known.<br/><br/>",

        "description": "DESIGNER'S NOTES:<br/>This is the third set in my card driven wargame rules, and although still loosely inspired by the Battle Cry &amp; Memoir '44 games by Richard Borg, the game no longer has a battlefield divided in 3 sections. Battlefield sections are great for ACW and WWII, but spreading a (smaller) imperial force across the battlefield would not always be realistic or playable, since in most colonial battles a smaller well armed imperial army faces hordes of natives. The left-center-right wing Battle Cry/Memoir '44 principle has here been replaced by color-coding the units red, green and blue (activated by cards of the same color) thus enabling the imperialist player to concentrate his units anywhere on the battlefield if he wishes to. Also, compared to ACW or WWII, there was a much bigger difference in quality of weapons used by imperialists and natives. Therefore the symbols on the dice are no longer representing the targets but rather the type of ammo/weapon used, whereby the more modern weapons have a better chance of scoring hits than outdated ones (see rules).<br/><br/>Since many colonial games are played in &quot;Darkest Africa&quot;, an (optional) set of &quot;event cards&quot; is added in order to spice up the &quot;adventure&quot; type games. When using the fast play variant, games with 20-30 native units (and about half of that number of imperial forces) can be concluded in 90-120 minutes (ideal for a club night). In order to have a balanced game, the number of victory points to be scored by imperialist armies should be around 1.5 times higher than for native forces.<br/><br/>",

In the game, a class of international students are ferried over to a deserted island by a teacher on a field trip. Unfortunately for them, the teacher is a big fan of the novel &quot;Battle Royale&quot;. Once the students awake on the island, their biggest fears are realized: There is only one way off the island - to be the last one standing. Kill or be killed, true survival of the fittest.<br/><br/>Intended as a party game, Survival of the Fittest mixes together hand-management and bluffing of Bang! with the second guessing and alliances of Werewolf, bringing in up to 12 players to play as twelve of the fourteen unique characters which are dealt out randomly (along with a starting weapon) to the players.<br/><br/>Each turn the players secretly (or openly!) choose one of the twelve map co-ordinates to go to that turn, each space giving different advantages (an extra health, a new melee weapon). However, once there, it's time for action! Players ally together to take down other players before turning on their friends. Killing an opponent allows the player to take the weapon, strengthening their own position and in turn making themselves more of a target. However, hiding like a coward is an acceptable tactic, as players can only attack others in the same co-ordinate. With plenty of meta-gaming and whispering going around the table, you can never be sure who to trust!<br/><br/>As the game goes on, co-ordinates get randomly taken out of play to close down the areas and force confrontation until only one player remains - the fittest, the survivor.<br/><br/>Designed by Luke Morris and published by Games On The Way, Survival Of The Fittest aims to push itself head first into the big group and party game genre.<br/><br/>",

Studying the &quot;personal description&quot; given by the dice in the tumbler, you can help Paul track down the crooks in a thrilling chase. Who will be the best assistant policeman and the quickest at catching the right crook?&quot;<br/><br/>This is a game in Haba's range of tumble-dice games, which include dice inside a sealed tumbler with a clear plastic dome. This game has 3 six-sided dice, two of which are essentially D3s, with 3 different faces repeated once. There is a die with dots (1, 2 or 3 dots), a colour die (yellow for the beach, green for the park and blue for the town) and a crook die (Policeman Paul, a chubby crook, a woman crook [on 2 faces] or a crook with a loot bag[on 2 faces]). Besides the dice and the rules, there's a large wooden piece representing Policeman Paul and a deck of 27 cards, showing all possible combinations with crooks of the three dice.<br/><br/>The 27 cards are placed face up on the table around the Policeman Paul piece. A player shakes the tumbler. Depending on what the dice in the tumbler show, players try to claim the corresponding cards on the table. If the crook die shows the Policeman Paul face, the other dice are ignored and players try to grab the Policeman Paul piece - the successful player gets to choose any card on the table and place it in front of himself. If the crook die shows a crook, the players try to cover with their hand the card showing the corresponding number (on the die with dots) of that kind of crook in the venue specified (by the colour die). Players can only use one hand and the player who successfully covers the correct card with his hand gets to place the card in front of him. Players who wrongly grab Policeman Paul or cover the wrong card can make no further attempt to claim the right card that turn. Cards in front of players can be captured by other players if the same combination of dice get rolled again.<br/><br/>The first player to claim five crook cards wins.<br/><br/>",

The game has 2 phases:<br/><br/>First the two players (or 1 player vs several, in a multi-player variant) first take turns placing their 8 tiles valued 1, 2, 3, 4, 4, 5, 6, 7 on a 4x4 square grid to create a payoff matrix which will be more favorable for them than for the opponent.  Then simultaneously one player chooses a row and the other a column for that payoff matrix to earn points, i.e. directly playing a classical game theoretic game, until one side reaches 25 points.<br/><br/>The multi-player variant in fact gives no upper bound on the number of players, but the example uses 4 players.<br/><br/>",

The King and Queen are weak, and there is no love lost between the King&rsquo;s musketeers and the Cardinal&rsquo;s guards. In a castle in Normandy, four musketeers have just broken out of solitary confinement. The castle is well garrisoned, with a full company of the Cardinal&rsquo;s guards, but the musketeers are determined to locate evidence of the Cardinal&rsquo;s treachery against the King, that they know is somewhere within the castle. They form a plan; each musketeer will search a different set of particular halls and chambers, and then attempt to escape from the castle while defeating as many guards as possible. Hopefully the musketeer with the evidence will reach the King. The task ahead won&rsquo;t be easy, but there is hope, and the musketeers have knowledge of a secret network of underground passages beneath the castle that the guards are unaware of.<br/><br/>In Cardinal&rsquo;s Guards, the player moves the musketeers around the castle, defeating or luring guards, while searching various chambers, before trying to escape.<br/><br/><br/>     The musketeers are represented by the four pawns.<br/>     The coins represent the guards.<br/>     The tiles represent castle chambers.<br/>     The dice are used to keep track of the chambers searched.<br/><br/><br/>The player&rsquo;s score at the end of the game is based upon the number of chambers searched, the number of guards defeated, and the number of musketeers who escape.<br/><br/>",

Use historical scenarios, explore the &quot;what might have been&quot; of great campaigns, or use a &quot;points&rsquo; system to build your own optimal force.<br/><br/>The diceless combat system means it all depends on your tactical skill... to know how unit strength compares with terrain advantages and enemy capabilities. You may groan at an error, but you&rsquo;ll never wail about bad die rolls&mdash;the results are entirely up to you and your opponent.<br/><br/>(Game description taken from Lost Battalion Games Website)<br/><br/>",

        "description": "In  Fist Full of Coins players arrange playing pieces according to instructions on a card and receive coins based on the complexity of the task and how well it was carried out.<br/><br/>With the game comes a game board that serves as the holding area for the games pieces, the four levels of game cards, and is where the player assembles the pieces.  The pieces in the game are various unique boxes and colored items which are arranged to match the instructions on a particular game card. There are four levels of card complexity in which the amount of instructions, and memory work increases.  Players decided on how many turns to take, and at the end of those turn the person with the most coins is the winner.<br/><br/>The game can be used daily to aid in communication and reading comprehension, dyslexia, and memory. Designed for solo up to four players. For ages 5 and up.<br/><br/>The game is in English but French and Spanish add-ons are available.<br/><br/>Home Page: <a target='_blank' href=\"http://www.nomorelearningdisorders.com\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer noopener\">http://www.nomorelearningdisorders.com</a><br/><br/>",

Printed in full color the book fills in areas that were hinted at in the Basic set with rules for:<br/><br/>-Vehicles<br/><br/>Rules for vehicles enhance the game play of USX by making cars and trucks more than just terrain pieces to hide behind, although they are still great cover! Damage, speed and handling all play a part in how your vehicle performs with a skid table, collisions and Hollywood type explosions all covered.<br/><br/>-Armor<br/><br/>Armor is handled through a simple yet effective modifier system that can be applied to vehicles and special units within the game.<br/><br/>-Mythos creatures<br/><br/>RAFM's Cthuhlu range of miniatures adds an element of horror to the game and allows players to face off against Mythos creatures. The use of a unique Horror check system compliments the Cthulhu element of the USX rules.<br/><br/>-Spells<br/><br/>You'll need some extra juju to deal with those horrors from beyond so we have included a few basic spells to help the budding cultist or investigator.<br/><br/>Specialty weapons and ammo such as flash bangs and man stopper rounds augment the game with special &quot;Advanced rules&quot; that work well when fighting off hordes of zombies or blinding the bad guys before your forces make their assault.USX is a flexible and fast game system capable of handling 2 player contests or group games with 4 and more players. Additional players do not slow USX and games will be concluded in 2 hours or less depending on the scenario. USX also features our &quot;Dual initiative system&quot; making the game more fun for all players involved.<br/><br/>",

        "description": "The name roughly translates to &quot;Open Sea Race&quot;. This is a sailing game where players decide on a course to run (St. Malo to Quebec, Lorient-Bermudas round trip, The Rum Route and others on the North Atlantic). Each player runs a boat and tries to be the first to finish the course. Winds will change from turn to turn, and players must adjust sail and attitude to the wind (i.e. course) according to the winds encountered. A unique mechanism is that players can master risks (incurred by carrying an inappropriate amount of sail in the prevailing wind conditions) by answering trivia questions about sailing. The questions come in 3 levels of difficulty; the correct answer allows to continue travel unharmed, a wrong incurs a penalty. Penalties can damage the boat, but each player has two repair cards to be used in case of emergency.<br/>The game board shows a map of the Atlantic Ocean from the equator to Newfoundland overlaid with a square grid. Certain currents and prevailing wind zones are marked and influence actual movement. Also on the map are obstacles in the form of completely blocked squares (ships, icebergs, large islands) and partly blocked squares (small islands).<br/><br/>",

        "description": "A Somali mancala game with Indian-style sowing.<br/> From Mancala World:<br/><br/>&quot;Bosh is a game played by the Darod clan in Somalia. It was first described by the ethnologue G. Marin in 1931. The game is similar to Indian mancala games such as Pachgarhwa and Sat-gol.<br/><br/>Rules<br/><br/>Bosh is played on a board of two rows, each consisting of five holes dug in the ground. There are four stones in each hole at the outset of the game.<br/><br/>At his turn a player distributes the contents of one of his holes anti-clockwise, one by one, into consecutive holes. After the last stone has been sown, the contents of the next hole are taken and distributed. These are Indian-style laps.<br/><br/>If the next hole is empty, the move is over. The contents of the hole immediately next to the empty one are captured. However, if the hole where a player has dropped his last stone is followed by two empty ones, he gets nothing.<br/><br/>If a player cannot move because all the holes on his side are empty, he forfeits all the remaing stones to his opponent.<br/><br/>Next round: each player fills his holes with four stones from his winnings. Any hole with less than the full amount is closed down with sand and considered as non-existent, but can be re-opened in a later round.<br/><br/>The aim of the game is to close down all the opponent's holes, that is to reduce his provision to less than four stones.&quot;<br/><br/>",

France, eager to continue flexing its military muscle, sent troops to colonize and control the Ukraine region while disarming the German troops there. The local population welcomed them to some degree thinking the French and Greek troops were sent to liberate them from the Red menace. Armed with tanks, aircraft and armor cars, the French sent the Greeks out to remote areas to secure it. However, the Red followers had secured vast amounts of weapons from the Germans, much to the dislike of the French, and were more than eager to fight. By March 1919, the Ukraine was on fire. The French and Greek troops were greatly disliked by all Russians after their true intentions had been revealed to the general public. This further emboldened the Red forces who were outnumbering the Allies.

        "description": "In Babel each player gets ten cards and trades cards with the other players in an attempt to form poker combinations. When a player has a good enough hand - two five-card combinations which are high enough, or a ten-card straight or flush - they go out. When a player reaches a certain target score the game ends.<br/><br/>With three to five players a single deck is used and players all sit at the same table. Trading is free-form and players may trade unequal numbers of cards. If trading bogs down and all players agree, they all draw one card from the deck but do not discard any (obviously not possible with five players). A player must have two combinations of flushes or better (or a ten-card set) to go out; when a player goes out the hand ends and all players score. Combinations lower than flush still score for the players not going out. If players drew extra cards only ten can be scored.<br/><br/>With more than five players multiple decks are used and the game is played as a party game with players circulating around the room. All trades must be equal since no extra cards can be drawn. When a player has two combinations of straight or better (or a ten-card set) they can take their hand to be scored and get a fresh hand. Pairs and triplets are not scored. This version is called Super-Babel in some editions.<br/><br/>",
