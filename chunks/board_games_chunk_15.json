The Germans move north from St. Louis while the Japanese move in from western Missouri and Iowa. MB's map has hexes 12 kilometers across, and counters represent 8,000 to 15,000 men, or 180 to 300 vehicles.

We'll have to go tracing the most favorable route as the scenario takes shape, always 4-row vision. We will have to manage wisely our progress chips and exploit our character ability. We will also have the help of the treasures that we will find on the way. The player that crosses first the last row, row 24, wins.<br/><br/>",

        "description": "This new version of Destruction of Army Group Center is a thorough redesign, by Ty Bomba, of the game originally published by old-SPI in the early 1970s (in S&amp;T#36). The campaign under examination is &ldquo;Operation Bagration,&rdquo; the Red Army&rsquo;s summer offensive of 1944 during which they destroyed more German manpower and equipment than had been lost at Stalingrad.<br/><br/>Without question a one-sided affair in terms of which side is &lsquo;shaping the battlefield&rsquo; and &lsquo;controlling the tempo,&rsquo; we&rsquo;ve managed to make things more interesting for both players by broadening the map to cover not only Byelorussia, but all of the Baltic Republics as well as the northwest Ukraine. That expansion gives both players more interesting options and strategies in terms of how to pursue victory.<br/> Each hex on the 34x22&rdquo; large-hex map equals 16 miles (26 kilometers). Each of the nine game turns equals one week, from IV June through IV August. Units of maneuver are corps (and static &ldquo;fortified localities&rdquo;) for the Germans and armies for the Soviets. The latter&rsquo;s great airpower advantage is represented in the form of 10 &ldquo;air armies.&rdquo; There are 176 large-size unit-counters included, most done in NATO-style, but also with iconic markers. The system is an adaptation of the one used in issue number three&rsquo;s Bulge, which means two experienced players can finish a match in about three to four hours.<br/><br/>The historical scenario provides exact set ups for both sides, but there are also free-deployment options. The &ldquo;Bold Stroke&rdquo; scenario allows the Soviet player to try the approach the Germans were expecting: putting the weight of the offensive in the western Pripyat Marsh and driving straight for Koenigsberg. Other options allow the investigation of such historical &ldquo;what ifs&rdquo; as the failure of the Western Allies&rsquo; D-Day landing or no July bomb plot against Hitler.<br/><br/>",

Back in the late 17th century, this would have allowed goods from the Pacific to be quickly traded across the Atlantic (and vice versa), and it seemed a fortune was there for the taking. Regrettably the adventure was beset by disease, shortage of supplies, the unremitting hardships of the jungle, and the Spanish! After all, they were trying to build a trading hub right in the middle of Spain's Empire.<br/><br/>Darien Apocalypse is Ragnar Brothers' second Quantum game, and it features four similar but different worlds together with the four Horsemen of the Apocalypse. One world may prosper, whilst another suffers deprivation. Scots are enlisted, ships sail, lands are explored. The original Caledonians managed to build a small encampment a fort and a watch tower. So buildings feature and drive the game, providing goods to raise more capital and special abilities to help build the colony and counter the Horsemen threat.<br/><br/>This game can be played co-operatively or competitively. It feels like a struggle &mdash; it was a struggle!<br/><br/>",

Two maps cover Europe and North Africa from Caucasus to Ireland and from Sweden to Egypt. 780 counters personify land and naval units as well as every corps-commanding leader of that time. The combat units are army corps and fleets, and sometimes entire armies. Their content varies with the player&rsquo;s will and the contingencies of that era; Guard, line infantry, Elite, light cavalry, heavy cavalry, militia, Cossacks, and so on. The game turns are season-based and interactive, including a variable number of impulses. A budget phase occurs every fall.<br/><br/>The game can involve two players (one French and one anti-French), or five players (France, Great-Britain, Prussia, Russia and Austria), or even seven players (Spain and the Ottoman Empire have their own player). Of course, victory conditions vary accordingly.<br/><br/>The operational part of the game points out the importance of leadership and line of communication; attrition can be very high. Evasive actions and interceptions lead to the deployment of armies followed by battle. Battle occurs in the same hex; troop quality, tactical choices and leader values are taken into account in the issue of the battle.<br/><br/>At the strategic level, the players are responsible for their unit&rsquo;s production and maintenance. Diplomacy is the key point in creating alliances with other powers, major or minor. Moreover, many random events improve the Napoleonic flavor of that time.<br/><br/>The overall purpose of the Grand Empire is to provide a strategic Napoleonic game that takes into account historical, military and diplomatic sights, and that can be played in a short period of time (one year is four turns and can be played in two hours) with a reasonable amount of rules.<br/><br/>Contents :<br/> * Two maps<br/> * 3 countersheets (260 double sided counters each).<br/> * one rulebook and one scenarios booklet.<br/> * 2 dice.<br/> * Tables and charts<br/><br/>",

You never use both halves of the card at once &mdash; either one or the other.<br/><br/>A turn consists of first playing a card to cover the shot your opponent played, then playing another card to dictate which of the six zones you'll hit the ball to. Finally, you play a preparation card, indicating which zones you're prepared to cover. The preparation card can be used to cover a shot if the appropriate zone is highlighted; otherwise you must cover the shot with a card from your hand, in which case the preparation card becomes the attack. Thus, by playing cards that your opponent cannot cover with her preparation card, you maintain control of the match because you'll see from where the next attack will come and will be able to prepare for that. Of course if a player cannot cover a shot at all, then the point is lost.<br/><br/>Combinations of cards can create special shots, which if not covered by the corresponding combination of cards, leave a player off balance, with her drawing only one card at the end of the turn instead of the usual two. This will leave her with fewer options and make it less likely that she'll cover your shots.<br/><br/>",

It is a wargame, but the heavily themed weapon aspects are abstracted to a very basic level, without loosing it's high technology appeal. After 30 minutes study of the rules you should be able to set up the first scenario, where you have one task force each, an Arleigh Burke class destroyer against a Sovremennyy class destroyer.

        "description": "From the publisher's blurb:<br/><br/>&quot;Players create marriages with the King and Queen cards in this classic trick-taking strategy game of timing and memory.  The winner is the first player to earn 7 Game Points over several rounds!&quot;<br/><br/>This is identical to the traditional trick-taking card game Schnapsen, except for the addition of a 0 in each suit.  Players take turns playing tricks in order to score game points -- after each round, scoring occurs, and the first player to reach 7 game points wins.  Rounds may end early if a player claims to have earned 66 trick-points during the round.  Marriages allow players with both Queen and King of a suit in their hand to claim additional trick-points for the round, provided they immediately lead with one of those two cards.<br/><br/>User summary:<br/>This is a standard trick-taking game. Each trick is won by the player who played the highest card of the leading color. A player that wins enough tricks during a round wins Game Points. The game continues for several rounds until a player wins by reaching seven Game Points.<br/><br/>NOTE: This game was available as a free, secret bonus for the Pack O Game Set 2 Kickstarter.<br/><br/>",

        "description": "From Khyber Pass Games website<br/> George Armstrong Custer and The Battle of the Little Bighorn have long overshadowed the Battle of the Rosebud.  Preceding the Little Bighorn by a week, the outcome of this battle directly influenced what happened to Custer and the 7th US Cavalry.<br/> General George Crook was given command of the Southern column of the Bighorn Campaign.  With Gibbon's column coming in from the West and the Terry/Custer column from the Northeast, the campaign's objective was to trap the Sioux and Northern Cheyenne and forcibly return them back to their reservation.<br/> Tactically the battle was inconclusive.  Casualties on both sides were relatively low, and in the end Crook held the field.  But strategically the Rosebud fight was a great victory for the Sioux and Cheyenne.  Crook expended a huge amount of ammunition; most soldiers were down to 10 rounds or fewer each.  Many horses were killed, injured, or worn out. Because of these reasons Crook decided to withdraw his command back to his base camp, effectively taking his column out of the campaign.<br/> Had Crook been able to continue operations he could have linked up with Custer's column, adding his infantry and cavalry to the 7th Cavalry.  Custer's last stand would have, in all probability, never have occurred.<br/> Game scale:<br/>Each combat unit represents:<br/> - one US Cavalry company<br/> - approximately 100 Indians<br/> - individual leader<br/>Each hex equals 1/4 mile across.<br/>Each game turn represents 20 minutes.<br/><br/>This game will be re-released by Legion Wargames as a boxed game with die-cut EasyPunch counters. Also being re-released is Volume I in the series Battle of the Little Bighorn.<br/><br/>This game is part of a series: The Battle of Rosebud Creek, The Battle of the Little Bighorn, and The Battle of Adobe Walls, November 25, 1864.<br/><br/>",

Each full-strength German infantry regiment contained some 4,000 men and three-dozen cannon; each full-strength British battalion had some 2,000 men and 18 cannon.<br/><br/>Since this battle was fought over only two days, and both sides' forces entered pretty much fully supplied, there are no supply rules.  Similarly, there are no replacements.  And finally, there are no concentric assault rules, since the British were too proud to become scared when they were surrounded, and the Germans wer too inexperienced to know they should be scared when they were surrounded.<br/><br/>(from section 1.0 of Rules)<br/><br/>",

        "description": "Castle Von Loghan is a co-op, group-decision making, survival board game that offers a unique narrative and dungeon-crawling gaming experience. The game includes several game modes, such as Story Campaign and Exploration.<br/><br/>Working together as one group, the players adventure inside Castle von Loghan where they will face an array of dangers but also will find several valuable treasures.<br/><br/>During each turn, players have to decide where to go next, solve the secrets of the room in which they have arrived, battle the enemies protecting it, then prepare for the next encounter.<br/><br/>The only route to winning the game is through survival &mdash; and to survive, they need to work together.<br/><br/>Notable mechanisms: Sharing of health and clarity, unique narrative events that require careful listening and decision making, a ten-game-long Story Campaign that is filled with the best RPG elements one could expect, easy-to-understand card-based tactical combat that comes with a variety of outcomes.<br/><br/>Intro to the story:<br/><br/>In 1970, inside the Albatross Scientific Institute (LOS ANGELES), a group of scientists make contact with a group of hyper-intelligent beings known as the CeDI (Celestial entities from the Downing Ipsys) who claim that humankind is doomed. They have brought with them some of their advanced technology, instructing the humans to make use of it in order to evacuate the Earth which, according to the aliens, will become uninhabitable in approximately 100 years. Aided by the scientists at the Institute, the aliens unlock G.O.D.O.S., an AI they have brought with them from their galaxy. They claim G.O.D.O.S. will help all of humanity... but the aliens seem to have a personal mission linked to G.O.D.O.S. as well; one which they haven&rsquo;t revealed to anyone else. On the 27th of August, G.O.D.O.S. is activated.<br/><br/>A council is formed and, with the help of the aliens, they begin work on Project KARR. The goal is to build at least five ships that are not only capable of carrying about 1 billion people each, but can keep them alive for hundreds of years. The KARR also serve as colonization units. The news of the aliens and of Project KARR is shared, bit by bit, with the humans, and by 2067, the ships are ready to launch.<br/><br/>In 2068, the ships leave earth, leaving behind all those who refuse to go.<br/><br/>Each ship heads towards a different point in space in the hopes of finding a suitable planet to serve as a new home. They cannot go to the aliens&rsquo; solar system, since humans can not survive such a long journey or the interstellar travel required to get there. After several years in transit, the KARR-5 ship collides with a huge meteorite and is heavily damaged. Hundreds of thousands of humans die, and many of the ship&rsquo;s sectors are damaged beyond repair.<br/><br/>In his desperation, a certain human decides to take matters into his own hands. Owning the only copy of G.O.D.O.S., a man named Deacon Padjin, the Prime Commander of the KARR-5, uploads G.O.D.O.S. to the KARR-5 ship&rsquo;s operating systems. G.O.D.O.S. takes over the entire ship!<br/><br/>With the help of G.O.D.O.S., the ship is saved. Humans learn how to resurrect the dead by placing the &ldquo;souls&rdquo; of deceased individuals into androids. The newly-resurrected individuals, known as the Resurrected, remain ignorant of their death and subsequent resurrection. This technology becomes so advanced over the years, that it is almost impossible for someone to tell if they&rsquo;re human or a Resurrected. The KARR-5&rsquo;s population begins growing back to its original size.<br/><br/>G.O.D.O.S. secretly develops a semi-functional time-machine, but after extensive testing, the results are grim: it can only send people to the past, but it can&rsquo;t bring them back, and it cannot send anyone into the future. G.O.D.O.S.<br/><br/>A few years pass; the KARR-5 is still stationary. Deacon Padjin, who is still deeply involved with the time-travel project, develops a module that allows time-travel to the future. After managing to remove G.O.D.O.S. from the ship's systems, he uses the time-machine to escape to the past, safely, taking the AI and some other people back with him.<br/><br/>The remaining leaders of the KARR-5 assess the situation and, after 10 years of testing and many different iterations, manage to partially replicate the time-machine.  Having done so, about ten years later, they send a group of KarrSEC agents after Deacon and G.O.D.O.O.S. armed with a state-of-the-art tracking device, capable of following someone through time.  As there have been no changes to their timeline, it is a widely-believed hypothesis that Deacon succumbed to an untimely death, either during the jump or as a result of it.  However, the KARR-5 Council, and the KarrSEC, want to ensure that G.O.D.O.S. be dismantled so that it can&rsquo;t make any modifications to the timeline, thus changing the course of History forever.<br/><br/>Meanwhile, the CeDI engage in secret meetings with some of the scientists from the Institute, informing them that the loss of G.O.D.O.S. will most likely have disastrous consequences. The CeDI finally reveal their true intentions: they need G.O.D.O.S. to break through a time bubble that has been placed around their planet in which an intergalactic battle is being fought. Without G.O.D.O.S., the CeDI will likely lose the battle, which could easily spread to other parts of the galaxy, a threat that none but the CeDI is prepared to face.<br/><br/>",

Each turn they have to perform one movement with their family members; other players at their starting location can decide to join them. While some locations allow players to collect goods, others have to be visited to fulfill goal cards which grant influence (victory points). The game ends immediately once a player has fulfilled five goal cards or chooses to reveal that they've collected one good of every kind. Players then tally up their points and the most influential Celt wins.<br/><br/>Celtic is an easily accessible family game for 2 to 4 players, ages 8 and up. Quick turns that allow inactive players to profit make for a light tactical game without downtime.<br/><br/>&mdash;description from the publisher<br/><br/>",

Skillfully unlock the best route up the ever-changing game board. Use strategy and tactics to jump over as many play pieces as you can, and prevent other players from getting to the top first by bumping them down.<br/><br/>Spin, Climb, Jump, Bump; Be First to the Top<br/><br/>GAME MATERIALS<br/>- Game Board &ndash; Six multi-colored rotatable rings, with 12 colored squares each and a black, stationary top level;<br/>- 18 Pawns &ndash; Three of each in six different colors &ndash; red, orange, yellow, green, blue and white;<br/>- Deck of Cards &ndash; 42 playing cards, as follows:<br/>   - 36 cards in six different colors and numbered 1, 2 or 3,<br/>   - Three &lsquo;any-color&rsquo; wild-cards, and<br/>   - Three &lsquo;unlimited-spin and any-color&rsquo; wild-cards.<br/><br/>OBJECT OF THE GAME <br/>Move all three pawns up the six rings and enter them all onto the top stationary 7th level.  First to do this wins the game. Second, third and fourth place winners follow continuing the game until the last pawn reaches the top level.<br/><br/>PAWN MOVEMENT <br/>- Pawns always move by one, up down or sideways, but never diagonally;<br/>- Two pawns cannot occupy the same color square<br/><br/>Jumping <br/>- A pawn can jump over or &lsquo;leapfrog&rsquo; any pawn;<br/>- The number of pawns in a row that you can leapfrog is unlimited, provided that the color card played is the same color as the square that the pawn lands on; and<br/>- Jumping can start from the first move onto the board and even onto the top 7th level.<br/><br/>Bumping <br/>- If the square above, adjacent or below is occupied, then you can bump that pawn directly down two levels, by playing the color card of that square and moving your pawn to the occupied square;<br/>- If another pawn occupies the square that your opponent&rsquo;s pawn dropped down to, then that pawn also drops down two levels and so on (even if they happen to be your own pawns);<br/>- You cannot leapfrog up to bump an opponent&rsquo;s pawn down two levels; and<br/>- Bumping is only possible by moving up one level, sideways or even down, if you choose to do so.<br/><br/>CARD PLAY<br/>There are three types of cards in the deck:  <br/>1. Numbered color cards are the main cards used in playing the game.<br/><br/>RING ROTATION<br/>- The number on a card is the number of squares that you can rotate a ring, 1, 2 or 3 either clockwise or counter-clockwise, as shown on the cards;<br/>- You can only rotate the ring level that your pawn is on; and<br/>- Rotating is optional, you can play the card as a color only card, but if rotating, then move the ring the same number of squares as the number shown on the card and always rotate the ring before playing the color.<br/><br/>COLOR PLAY<br/>- The color on the card is the only square color that you can move a pawn to, when played;<br/>- If after rotating a ring, the square color above where the pawn arrives is the same as the color of the card, then you can climb up to that square, bump another pawn or leapfrog to a higher square of that same color, in a combination move. If not, then play a second color card if you have the color match.<br/><br/>2. Any-color wild-cards, allow you to move one pawn up, down or to an adjacent square from where your pawn is positioned, regardless of the color of that square:<br/> - The card also allows your pawn to climb, jump and bump, as explained in Pawn Movement above and to move up to the final 7th level;<br/> - This card cannot rotate any rings.<br/><br/>3.

When everybody else passes, the last player to have played a card collects for purposes of end-of-game scoring the whole pile of cards (which for convenience will be called a trick) and then has the lead. The Ohio card is deemed always just a little lower than the last card played, so if a 2 is played and then an Ohio card (or two or three Ohio cards), a 1 would still be lower. When one person plays their last card, finish the trick and calculate the scores. Ohio cards count negative 10. All others their face value. Cards still in hand count negative (including Ohio card which is negative 10 if still in hand). The player with the highest total wins.<br/><br/>",

        "description": "Twilight of the Ottomans: World War I in the Middle East (TOTO for short), is an intermediate-complexity simulation of the Ottoman Empire's campaigns, and those campaigns waged against that realm, during World War I.<br/><br/>One player controls the Ottoman forces along with other Central Power units. The other player controls the various Allied contingents. TOTO has been designed by Joseph Miranda.<br/><br/>The concept and exploitation of victory points is central to play of the game. Players begin with a designated number of victory points, which they may keep, or expend them to gain reinforcements and execute other actions. Players gain new victory points as a result of achieving their strategic objectives. Players lose victory points when they suffer losses in combat. To win, you must have more victory points than your opponent; so play becomes a competitive balancing act between attaining new objectives without spending too many of your previously earned victory points to do it.<br/><br/>Each player has a range of unit types available: infantry, cavalry, expeditionary combined arms forces, early mechanized units, air and naval, as well as guerrillas and the major personalities of the era, such as Lawrence of Arabia. Logistics are also critical, as players utilize supply units to enhance their movement and combat capabilities.<br/><br/>The 34x22&quot; large-hex map covers from Mecca and Medina north through Mesopotamia to the Caucasus, west to the Nile Delta, east to Persia, and northwest to Adrianople, at 87 miles per hex. Each game turn equals a quarter of a year.<br/><br/>There are 280 half-inch, NATO-style (and some iconic), unit-counters. Units of maneuver are primarily divisions, but numerous corps, brigades, regiments and battalions are also included in the orders of battle.<br/><br/>There are two short scenarios, one early war and one late war, along with a full campaign game. The rules run to approximately 15,000 words; so two experienced players can finish the campaign game in about six hours.<br/><br/>",

There also exists a 5-player version called Pentachiavel.<br/><br/>It is a game of treason. Each player is the leader of a political party composed of 9 pieces:<br/>1 Leader<br/>1 Journalist<br/>1 Assassin<br/>1 Provoker<br/>1 Necromobile<br/>4 Activists<br/>who roam a 9x9square board where all squares are the same except the central one, called The Labyrinth.<br/><br/>All counters move as the Queen in Chess, except the Activist who moves the same but only for two squares.<br/>A piece cannot move through another piece, whether alive or dead.<br/><br/>Object of the game: gaining absolute power, that is killing all other leaders.<br/>&quot;To do this, all players have the weapons of the actual politics: manipulation, provocation, activism, recuperation, scandal and political crime. The course to power is not a gala dinner, so all pieces can be physically eliminated. In politics, a dead is as encumbrant as a living person, so all dead pieces are kept on the board, face down.&quot;<br/><br/>Dead pieces have no color.<br/><br/>The Labyrinth is the basement of the Legal Power, the road to Absolute Power. Only a Leader may stay on this square. It makes its parti play after each opponent. But there, it can be killed by nearly all other pieces.<br/><br/>The Leader: can kill any piece on the board by taking its place. The taken piece is placed on any other adjacent free square of the board, dead.<br/><br/>The Journalist kills a piece that is adjacent to any one of the 4 squares that share a common border with its square. It does this just after having moved. The body lies dead where it was killed. He must move at least one square before killing.<br/><br/>The Assassin, can kill any piece by taking its place. The piece is placed, dead on the place the Assassin was before moving.<br/><br/>The Provoker, mover of the living: can move any living piece if it takes its position. The taken piece is placed on any other free square of the board, alive.<br/><br/>The Necromobile, mover of the dead: can move any dead piece if it takes its position. The taken piece is placed on any other free square of the board, dead.<br/><br/>The Activists can kill a piece by taking its place. The taken piece is placed on any other free square of the board, dead. They CAN'T kill a leader in The Labyrinth.<br/><br/>These are most of the rules.

Racing to build parody video games such as 'Pinky Gear Solid' and 'Elder May Cry', you are a game developer competing for the components needed to create games in four genres: RPG, Fighting, Music and First Person Shooter games.<br/><br/>Each video game has some basic components (title, character, gear) that are essential, but can also include optional components (extra characters, gear upgrades, easter eggs) that increase the video game's market value. The video game components (cards) also double as money for purchases and auctions, so you're constantly struggling to manage your hand and make trade-offs on what to acquire and what to give up in return.<br/><br/>The best video games get victory point bonuses but the game ends immediately as soon as any developer releases four video games to market. So you have to decide: do I wait to put in that snazzy Easter Egg and create the best video game or do I beat the competition by releasing more games to the market?<br/><br/>Pink Godzilla Dev Kit is a light/medium weight card game for 2-4 players, with enough interesting decisions and tension to satisfy serious gamers but not overwhelm casual gamers.<br/><br/>The game parodies everything from retro Nintendo classics to the latest Japanese imports featuring a pantheon of offbeat characters like Pixel, the Elders, Jumpman, the Ninja Suppressors, the Good, Evil and Neutral Guardians and Pink Godzilla himself. The artwork for the cards is original, refreshing, and oozing with theme.<br/><br/>Win or lose, serious and casual gamers alike will enjoy being able to create parodies of their favorite video games.<br/><br/>Home Page: <a target='_blank' href=\"http://www.pinkgodzillagames.com/devkit/\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer noopener\">http://www.pinkgodzillagames.com/devkit/</a><br/><br/>",

On their turn, players must play their lowest numbered card. The cards are numerical from 3-8.<br/><br/>When playing a card, the tile that has the same number is flipped over to its water side, eventually flipping a tile with a player's token. Players use the two gondola cards, enabling them to rescue their tokens to another tile. The tokens excavate treasures by travelling to a specifically coloured tile and exchanging one coin for the corresponding coloured treasure.<br/><br/>When all cards have been played, there remains part of the map that is not submerged. These remaining tiles are used to calculate the value of the treasures by rarity.<br/><br/>",

        "description": "Bla5t is a fun and quickly learnt party game in french that combines memory and strategy. It was designed by two authors and one artist from Lausanne (Switzerland) and released in November 2016, after a long year of development.<br/><br/>The game is inspired from an old 56 classic cards game known as Tamalou, Raspoutine or Gabo. It is played in several rounds where the players will avoid cumulating points. Each of them starts with 4 cards face down and looks only at 2. By replacing some of their cards with drawn ones and playing capacities, they will progressively gain knowledge of their game and the ones of their opponents, whom they will steal cards from.<br/><br/>At the end of each round, the players&rsquo; scores are marked down and added to the ones of previous rounds. A game ends when one of the players reaches 100 points, the winner being the one who has the least. For a shorter game, a maximum score of 50 points can be set.<br/><br/>The theme is post-apocalyptic, the illustrations being humoristic creatures and heroes inspired by old movies.<br/><br/>",

The player who scores the most points wins.<br/><br/>Each player has shepherds to place on the board and sheep to place into flocks and move. Flocks often contain sheep from many players and cooperation can be key to moving a flock into an advantageous position.

It is these cards, with their requirement to manipulate other players' pieces, that drive the decisions the players must make in the game and guarantee a high level of interaction among players. Each player also has a Sheepdog wild card for use once per game.<br/><br/>",

Each player may only introduce two new villagers per turn across five or six turns total. Villagers start as farmers earning a fixed income. Part of that income may be spent to purchase trade licenses which allow your villagers to set up as traders. Traders earn an income based on the population of their village. Each village must also elect a representative to government each turn. These councilors move to town and have no income for that turn (so much for realism - there is no provision for special interest groups or political action committees!). The government must decide whether to tax the farmers, tax the traders, or revoke one type of trade license. When this session of government breaks up councilors can either pay their own way home or pay a small fee and remain in government for another turn (well, at least that sounds realistic!). Each turn a new marketplace is opened which doubles the income of the host village. The villages bid fiercely for the right to host the new market each turn. Finally, the villagers and traders earn income and pay their taxes.

On your turn, you choose one action between collecting tea, hiring farmers to help you improve your production, expanding your tea houses in the countryside to get famous, and selling your production to high class society. You can also grant offerings to the shogun and your temple to gain prestige (VPs).<br/><br/>The game ends when a player has 7 VPs or when the demand for tea runs out, then the player with the most VP wins.<br/><br/>&mdash;description from the publisher<br/><br/>",

        "description": "From the Avalanche Press website:<br/>  <br/>Rome at War: Queen of the Celts<br/><br/>In the year 43 AD, Roman legions splashed ashore in Kent, unopposed by the Britons led by Caractus, who had sworn to repel them. The Emperor Claudius had dispatched Aulus Plautius and 45,000 men to conquer the mist-covered island where Julius Caesar had failed almost a century earlier.<br/> Over the next 40 years, Roman would clash with Celt in a series of battles that neither realized would determine the future of Western civilization.  The Romans broke the Britons, whose furious courage could not match Roman discipline. The island would pass under Roman rule for the next several centuries, implanting a Latin-oriented culture and shoving Celtic ways to the very fringes of Europe. All that would remain were their legends; not least among them the fiery leadership of Boudicca, warrior-queen of the Iceni and resolute enemy of Rome.<br/><br/>The Series: Rome at War (Avalanche Press) series covers Roman battles against both their neighbors and each other. The first game, Rome At War I: Hannibal at Bay, covered the last battles of Carthage&rsquo;s favorite son. The second, Rome at War II: Fading Legions, focused on the empire&rsquo;s latter years, when it was beset by barbarian invasion, an implacable rival, and civil war.<br/><br/>Rome at War: Queen of the Celts is the third installment in the series. Rome has outstanding heavy infantry, good light cavalry (provided by her allies) and even an elephant. The Britons depend on the fury of their Celtic charge, and also chariots and slingers. Plus they have Druids to help inspire them. <br/> There are nine scenarios, or game situations, included in Queen of the Celts.<br/><br/><br/>",

The object of the game is to describe items of a given subject to one's teammate as quickly as possible. Each team has thirty seconds for each list. The team with the most points after three rounds advances to the &quot;Winners Circle&quot; round.<br/><br/>In the &quot;Winners Circle&quot; one teammate must make a list of items which fit each of six different categories. If the teammate can guess all six subjects in under sixty seconds the team wins the big money. The team with the most money after three games is the winner.<br/><br/>The eight Milton Bradley games never used the actual Winner's Circle format, opting to use descriptions of items like the front game. The first three games were $10,000, with the Third Edition later repackaged as $20,000 with slightly different artwork to accommodate the change. The eighth game used $50,000, per the brief 1981 series.<br/><br/>",

Each racer needs boldness, tactical skills, and some good luck if they want to be the winner at the end of the race.<br/><br/>On a turn, the active player rolls up to six dice (one at a time) and advances their racer according to the results. But be careful! If you roll doubles, you must draw a crash card and anything can happen&mdash;depending on the double you may get a boost or be slowed down, letting others catch up. However, you can gain bonus cards for repeated doubles that can make up for lost position, if used correctly.<br/><br/>Using the unique abilities of the racers and collecting Boost markers, the players can manipulate the outcome of the race to their advantage. On top of all of this, players may have to fight for track position. Whenever two racers share the same space, a duel takes place to decide who will advance by one space and who will stay.<br/><br/>Finally, crossing the finish line will shuffle the racers&rsquo; positions due to the effects of the goal cards.<br/><br/>-description from publisher<br/><br/>",

Unfortunately you can't do this alone, and you need the help of the other magazines, but they are interested only in launching the models in their portfolio. Can you trick the other magazines in covering the models that help you achieve your goal and crush their dreams to become the most prestigious magazine?<br/><br/>In more detail, the game is played in seasons. Each three months make one complete season, and after each season, a season special is published with your top model. To select a model, a player always has a selection of possible models available (his portfolio). Based on the selections of the different magazines you influence the public and determine the trends for the season. By anticipating the selections of your opponents and selecting the right model for your own magazine you can try to put a model on one of your covers that is completely in line with all trends so it can be your star in the season special. If you manage to do this, you keep the model in your score pile and you score points. If you haven't managed to cover such a model, you don't score points this round unless you managed to put three models on the cover that don't have anything in common with the fashion trends. If you manage to have such alternative models you can score multiple models, but this isn't easy to achieve.<br/><br/>Unfortunately it is impossible to keep your star models as they will look for other opportunities, so during the game you will see many models leave and the selection of new models is also a key aspect of the game.<br/><br/>After three years (12 seasons/rounds), the game ends. You count the points of the models you scored during the game. Not all models have the same point value. The later the model enters the game the more points she's worth, because such a model is more difficult to score.<br/><br/>The game features 162 unique highly detailed models, a catwalk with public that also serves as a storage solution, a scoreboard and markers to achieve a realistic gaming experience.<br/><br/>Who'll be the star on your cover?<br/><br/>",

        "description": "Each Anno Domini set consists of 336 cards, with a description of a historical event on one side of the card, and the year (and sometimes specific date) in which it happened on the other.<br/><br/>Each player receives nine of these cards (or less, if you want the game to be shorter), and may only look at the descriptions. Players then put in turn a card on the table, *trying* to put theirs in chronological order. A player may, instead of adding a card, claim that the order in which the cards were put is incorrect. In this case all cards are turned over and the correct years revealed.<br/>If the order was correct then the doubting player receives two cards and skips a turn. If the order was incorrect then the previous player, who accepted the order as correct, receives three cards. The first player that gets rid of all the cards wins.<br/><br/>Bluffing is as least as important as knowledge in this game. Most events are rather obscure or are hard to date exactly, so this ain&rsquo;t no game for the nerds/geeks of this world, even they might think so, because it&rsquo;s full of surprises and pure fun. Highly recommended, because Anno Domini is a blast to play, is a very enjoyable social event and you even learn something from it.<br/><br/>Unfortunately there is no English edition in existence, but this game could be a good way, to improve your already existing German skills or a very good reason, to learn German language in the first place.<br/><br/>The set &quot;America&quot; contains historical events which are related to America. This relationship is not necessary obvious. Like all Anno Domini the America edition can be played as standalone or mixed with some or even all editions.<br/><br/>Part of the Anno Domini series<br/><br/>",

        "description": "The Bayonet &amp; Musket Battles series is GMT's follow-up to the extremely popular Musket &amp; Pike series, showing the movement of European warfare from tactical systems based on shock to a modern reliance on firepower.  Volume 1 will be Banish All Their Fears, covering the battles of Neerwinden, 1693 and Blenheim, 1704.<br/><br/>- Neerwinden, July 29, 1693, War of the League of Augsburg.  Outnumbered and thoroughly out-maneuvered by the French army under the Duke of Luxembourg, British King William III refuses to retreat his Allied army over the river to his rear and instead elects to defend a stout breastwork line strongly anchored on fortified villages. Luxembourg has the cream of the French army at his command, and sees an opportunity to break the enemy defenses and possibly destroy the Allied army.<br/><br/>-  Blenheim, August 13, 1704, War of the Spanish Succession.  Facing defeat in Spain, northern Italy, and along the Rhine, the Duke of Marlborough leads his Allied army deep into Bavaria and threatens to remove that key French ally from the war.  The French respond by sending an army under Marshal Tallard that links up with the Bavarians under Elector Max Emmanuel and stands to face Marlborough near the village of Blenheim on the banks of the Danube.<br/><br/>Larger armies and the primacy of firepower mean significant changes for the familiar Musket &amp; Pike game system:<br/><br/><br/>     Larger armies.  Brigades became the primary battlefield maneuver element, and while retaining foot battalions and horse regiments as our unit scale, we've made brigades paramount. Shifting brigades between wings and committing them into action to take advantage of enemy mistakes was the essence of victory for the great commanders of the age, and we've built that into the game.<br/>     Supremacy of firepower.  Combat has been streamlined and simplified so that most unit combats are now resolved in 1 - 2 die rolls with decisive results.  Players will soon learn the importance of creating and using fresh reserves to bolster their shot-up frontline battalions.<br/>     Solid map and OOB research.  Nothing new here, the consistently high level of historical research that went into maps and OOB's in the Musket &amp; Pike series continues.  <br/><br/><br/>",

The Battle Games cover each of the pitched battles of the war - The Battle of the Alma, The Battle of Balaclava, The Battle of Inkerman, The Battle of Evpatoria, The Battle of Tchernaya, and the Storming of the Malakov.

Each turn, a player picks one card from their hand to play and then activates an ability printed on that card (3 choices). There are nine abilities that enable you to manipulate cards in your hand or your opponent&rsquo;s hand, earn victory points, or steal them from an opponent.  The game ends when a player has no more cards in his hand, at which point the surprise factor of the Trojan Horse and Favor of the Gods award a few extra points.<br/><br/>Clever managing of your hand and wise choice of which ability to trigger can help you triumph over your opponents!<br/><br/>",

Players are in control of one of these two districts, and by drafting and playing cards depicting the city's Characters, they attempt to secure the support of the councils and have the best inhabitants.<br/><br/>The game begins with players drafting the 64 character cards to form two 32 card decks, one for each player.  During the player's turn, the player gains actions to play Character cards into his district.  Each character belongs to one of the four cliques, and many have special abilities, called Traits, that occur when they are placed into a district from a player's hand.  Additionally, at the end of a player's turn, the player will place a card from his hand face down on one of the council cards.  When a Character with the Ksari trait is played in a district, the corresponding Clique Council is convened, and the player with the highest value of face down cards wins the support of the convened council.<br/><br/>Players score points for the Characters in their districts, as well as points for the Council support they have received.<br/><br/>",

On both the Eastern and Western fronts the Allies were on German soil. It seemed only a matter of time before the final battle for the Third Reich would begin...and the victor of that battle could not be in doubt. Adolf Hitler the Nazi dictator saw the situation dilferently. He prepared to launch an all-out offensive through the heavily forested Ardennes in Belgium to capture the port of Antwerp.<br/>  Carefully husbanding the panzer reserves, Hitler and his generals concentrated a powerful force in secrecy. In these dense, misty forests, fully 200.000 Gemian troops, 1.500 pieces of heavy artillery and almost 700 tanks assault/guns moved into their assault positions. From his Zaegenberg castle headquarters, Generalfieldmarshall von Rundstedt relayed the following message to the thousands of German troops assembling in the snowy Eifel: &quot;Soldiers of the Western Front!

The crucially important port city of Antwerp had fallen to a rapid British advance in September, but the port could not be used until the coastal artillery defences at the mouth of the Scheldt had been neutralized and the river swept of thousands of mines. It fell to the First Canadian Army, already tired and overstretched after being in continuous combat since the D-Day invasion, to do this.<br/><br/>The nature of this campaign poses challenges to the players: the grinding, attritional nature of the fighting; the difficulty of the terrain fought over; and the limited resources available to either side. The Staff Card system, adapted from Joe Miranda's &quot;Bulge 20&quot; system, does not allow players to move and fight every unit every turn, as is often the case in other wargames - they must choose what they want to do, and where, and how to support it. The combat system, seemingly very simple because it does not rely on odds computations or column shifts, favours the defence and reflects the incremental nature of unit losses as they wear away in the fighting.<br/><br/>",

        "description": "&quot;Revolution Road&quot; presents the first two conflicts between Britain and her American colonials in 1775 which ignited the American Revolutionary War. Two complete games are included, BOSTON TO CONCORD and BUNKER HILL. These are fast, tense battles. Card driven, area movement, low counter density, quick play and simple to learn, all make REVOLUTION ROAD a wonderful introduction to the American Revolution and to war-gaming. Its wealth of historical information makes it an ideal teaching tool.<br/><br/>Although the scale between the games is decidedly different the same rules apply with only slight differences. BOSTON TO CONCORD is a game of maneuver, very chess-like. For the Patriot player it involves alarming the countryside with night-riders, mustering militia and trying to fend off the best infantry in the world. For the British it is playing hide and seek with Patriot Arms caches as he ferrets out Sons of Liberty troublemakers and then tries to make it back to waiting reinforcements as the Patriot forces grow to unmanageable size.<br/><br/>Bunker Hill is a different animal altogether, a basic slug-fest. The Patriot player faces a growing tide of redcoats who threaten to overwhelm his defense works on every turn. Patriots face disappearing ammunition, flanking, panic and optional rules for alternate British landing sites. As casualties mount historic leaders try desperately to rally their men and bring about the miraculous result reflected upon by British General Henry Clinton when he declared &quot;It was a dear-bought victory; another such would have ruined us.&quot;<br/><br/>",

        "description": "The Guardians of Xobos is a sci-fi themed tabletop game inspired by RTS classics, in which players compete to gain control over the last active source of energy on the planet. A long, long time ago Patrons, great explorers of the universe, arrived on Xobos and after gathering enough power to continue their journey, they left Guardians there to protect the planet. The Guardians of Xobos cared for the energy sources for centuries, but once the planet began to fade, they started to fight each other in order to survive.<br/><br/>The game is full of dynamic action tactical and strategy battle with unique mechanism of upgrading units by creating &quot;links&quot; between the Guardians. The player can give orders to his units, so that each unit can be supported by a different Guardian to gain healing powers or improved attacks. Since the Guardians can be upgraded via technology, one unit can act as a &quot;tank&quot; with a huge amount of damage or healing powers. In the game it is also possible to focus on economy by building structures for gathering resources and producing smaller units called Quarks.<br/><br/>To win the game, the player must gather Energy to revive the dying source and have the highest amount of Energy in round 15, the last one in the game. <br/>In The Guardians of Xobos there are 5 structures for gathering resources, upgrading units and protecting the territory.<br/><br/>Each turn consists of two phases:<br/>Phase 1: Tactical phase, in which players move units (Quarks and Guardians) around the map and place tokens to mark attacks. After each player takes their turn, the fights between units are resolved (the player attacking other units declares damage he/she deals upon an enemy unit).<br/><br/>Phase 2: Economic phase, completed simultaneously by all players, in which each player can establish links between Guardians, create Quarks, start building structures, and build technology tiles to boost units (or upgrade other military aspects of units or buildings).<br/>Important note: there is no randomness in the game, no dice rolling or card drawing. In fact, there are no dice or cards, but only Units and Technology Tiles available for purchase using certain resources.<br/><br/>From the beginning of the first round players need to focus on various aspects of military and economic development to gain control over the last active source and each of the 15 rounds is more and more intense.<br/>&mdash;description from the designer<br/><br/>",

        "description": "To start with, Spot it! Party features a deck of Spot it! cards with symbols that differ from those in the original game or any previously released version: a gnome, a plunger, headphones, and so on. Each card in Spot it! features eight different symbols, with the symbols varying in size from one card to the next; any two cards have exactly one symbol in common. For the basic Spot it! game, reveal one card, then another. Whoever spots the symbol in common on both cards claims the first card, then another card is revealed for players to search, and so on. Whoever has collected the most cards when the 55-card deck runs out wins.<br/><br/>To this basic game Spot it! Party adds eight colored card holders and (more importantly for gameplay) a &quot;hand mascot&quot; &ndash; a totem shaped like the eyeball-bearing hand in the game's logo. Six new mini-games &ndash; such as called &quot;The Race&quot;, &quot;Dynamite&quot;, and &quot;Double Frenzy&quot; &ndash; incorporate the card holders and hand mascot into the gameplay. In &quot;The Tower&quot;, for example, players still need to make matches, but they also need to keep an eye out for opportunities to steal or pass the hand mascot in order to have a chance to win.<br/><br/>",

The White Mage Jasper is quite the famous gardener and his pumpkins always win the blue ribbon at the local faire. His long-time adversary and neighbor, Zot the Necromancer, who is not good at growing living things, has summoned an army of the undead to smash all of Jasper's prize-winning pumpkins. Help Jasper defend his pumpkins by turning Zot's shambling minions into delicate white flowers and then burning them to ash!<br/><br/>Game play borrows heavily from classic arcade games such as Space Invaders and Puyo Pop.  The player moves Jasper horizontally along the garden path while casting spells to either transform the approaching zombies into flowers or ignite those flowers and any nearby zombies with magical fire.  The more you destroy with a single spell, the more points you earn.  If you can survive both waves of Zot's undead army, you win the game and earn a score based on how well you did.<br/><br/>Jasper and Zot won first place in the one full-sheet label game design contest here on BGG.

In this game, a player receives a hand of six cards, with one card placed face-up in front of him. A card shows a combination of two different colors/symbols familiar to those who know the Ingenious board game.<br/><br/>On a turn, the active player plays one of his hand cards and scores as many points for each symbol on the played card as there are symbols lying in front of all players. These points are marked in the matching color track on a player's individual scoring board, and the first player to have seven or more points in all colors wins. Progress is complicated by three barriers on the scoring tracks, which cannot be passed unless all colors have been bumped to a certain level of points &ndash; thereby forcing players to push their colors evenly.<br/><br/>As in Ingenious, players take an extra turn immediately if they max out the points available in a color, with ten being the highest number in Einfach Genial: Das Kartenspiel.<br/><br/>Einfach Genial: Das Kartenspiel was later released as one of three games in Fantasy Flight Games' Ingenious Challenges.<br/><br/>",

Players then take turns placing their seven houses on the game board; each house must be placed in an empty space that's not orthogonally adjacent to any of your other pieces.<br/><br/>On a turn, move one of your pieces in a straight line in the direction of the roof ridge as many spaces as you wish. You cannot cross over occupied spaces. To end the move, rotate the piece 90&ordm;. Alternatively, you can call on the clergyman for help. If a piece's movement is blocked on both sides, whether by the edge of the board or other pieces, you can swap the locations of this piece and the clergyman; to end your turn, rotate the piece 90&ordm;.<br/><br/>To win, you must have all of your pieces connected orthogonally; additionally, your steeple must be orthogonally adjacent to your nave.

All cards are played face up. When the last Gemino Pip Tokens are drawn from the starting pile, each player has one remaining turn before the round ends and players tally their score.<br/><br/>In more detail, at the start of a turn, a player draws two Gemino Pip Tokens, then takes any of the following actions in any order and as many times as they like:<br/><br/><br/>    Trade GPips for GSquares on the card grid (placing pips in the common pool)<br/>    Trade GSquares for GDiamond on the card grid (placing cards in the discard pile)<br/>    Discard GSquares for GPip equivalents from the common pool (placing discards in the discard pile)<br/>    Trade GPips for the Sun card or GSquares for the Nova card<br/><br/><br/>At the end of their turn, the player refills the card grid from the draw deck one at a time. If they reveal any Action Cards, those cards are resolved immediately, starting with the active player, then moving clockwise around the table.<br/><br/>After the last Gemino Pip Token is drawn and the final player has a turn, players score their hands as well as Sun/Nova points. (GPips are not worth any points, but should be tracked each round as a tie breaker.) Whoever has the most points wins.<br/><br/>",

        "description": "When gods fight, the blood of simpletons flows freely. Teomachia lets you become one of the ancient gods and spend one hour playing the lord of a group of devoted followers. You have one goal and one goal only: Annihilate your foe's believers and thereby move yourself one step closer to absolute power.<br/><br/>Drafting prayer cards and power cards allows you to slowly build your might. Using those cards, you send your followers into battles, build temples, and inflict terrible curses on the unfaithful. You face a tough decision in every single hand: Should you put your own power on the line to help your believers win their battles, or should you turn your back on them, sending them to a certain death? If no god yields, hurricanes will face off with deathly plagues, tempests will extinguish walls of fire, and the ranks of the faithful will grow smaller every second.<br/><br/>Once you get rid of your opponent's last prophet, it's time to rest and listen to the cheerful song of your people. You have won the clash of gods. You have won Teomachia.<br/><br/>Theomachie, the second edition of Teomachia debuting in German in 2013, features new illustrations and expands the gameplay for up to four players, instead of the two-player limit of the first edition. The game was also reimplemented in two separate English editions: Theomachy: The Ancients and Theomachy: The Warrior Gods successfully crowdfuned in 2015 and released in coopeartion with Petersen Games.<br/><br/><br/>Teomachia to gra karciana przeznaczona dla 2 os&oacute;b. Każdy z graczy wciela się w jedno z b&oacute;stw pochodzących ze starożytnych mitologii. Celem gry jest pozbawienie przeciwnika jego wyznawc&oacute;w i odesłanie go w zapomnienie. W trakcie rozgrywki gracze będą rozbudowywali swoje unikatowe talie, kt&oacute;re pozwolą im wspierać własnych wyznawc&oacute;w i unicestwiać wiernych przeciwnika. Każde rozdanie będzie starciem, w kt&oacute;rym gracze wysyłając swoich wiernych do walki i wspierając ich swą boską mocą będą starali się pokonać przeciwnika. Dodatkowo każde z b&oacute;stw występujących w grze dysponuje zupełnie inną mocą, wspieraną dodatkowo przez karty mit&oacute;w, na kt&oacute;re składają się najpotężniejsi herosi i artefakty związane z daną mitologią.<br/><br/>",

One deck required.<br/><br/>You are held in Colditz Castle, a WWII German POW camp reserved for the elite of escapers and special prisoners. Can you Escape from Colditz Castle?<br/><br/>1-6 players age 7+<br/><br/>SINGLE PLAYER:<br/>The object of the Single Player game is to piece together one or more escape chains to allow a total of three Escapers (together or one at a time) a &lsquo;HOME RUN&rsquo; to freedom before the Guard draw pile runs out. The escape chains are achieved by forming a column of sequential cards in front of you numbered 1-4. Upon your third Escaper escaping, you win the game against the Guards! With an optional Expansion Pack 8 Escapers should be the target.<br/><br/>MULTIPLAYER:<br/>The object of the Multiplayer game is to be the first to piece together one or more escape chains to allow a single Escaper a &lsquo;HOME RUN&rsquo; to freedom. You also play Action Cards against your opponents, stopping their own escape attempts. The escape chains are achieved by forming a column of 4 sequential cards in front of you numbered 1-4. Upon laying your HOME RUN card, you win the game against your opponents! Hints to help you on multi-player are shown on each card.<br/><br/>CREATOR&rsquo;S NOTE:<br/><br/>I prototyped this game after dreaming it up at Christmas. I scribbled it frantically on bits of card and played with my wife and kids (17 and 21). Brutal fun as someone commented is spot on.<br/><br/>In the addictive multiplayer mode there was short-lived gloating at apparently strong hands, poker faces pretending a good hand, frustration, Intense rivalry between the kids, fist pumping joy and laughter at someone else&rsquo;s plight. Confiscating each other&rsquo;s cherished cards was contentious. The diversion cards being played out of turn were priceless double-crossing targeted at who has annoyed you the most and part of the joy and pain of playing with friends or family. I think in football they say there is no such thing as a friendly.<br/><br/>The single player is a different game altogether. The black guard pack sits there silent and seems to know what you are planning, coming up with cards like it&rsquo;s been tipped of by a snitch. You dread the Inevitable Traitor card making his appearance. But then there is the joy of getting a good run going, tempered with wondering on the turn of each card whether your luck is about to come to an abrupt end. There are 14 escapers waiting in your pack and extension pack for a home run, and the first person to ever get all 14,  I would tell them to go buy a lottery ticket. They will command the luck of the gods.<br/><br/>",

        "description": "The War of Jenkins&rsquo; Ear simulates the last major conflict in the Caribbean between England and Spain from about 1739 to 1748 (though it was largely eclipsed in Europe by the War of Austrian Succession at the time.) The actual underlying cause of the war was trading rights in the lucrative West Indies. After centuries of intermittent and reoccurring war between the English and Spanish, these two maritime powers had managed to work out a trade agreement that ended their conflicts but not their longstanding enmity. In April 1731, the captain of the Spanish caravel La Isabela intercepted and boarded an English brigantine (the Rebecca) near Jamaica that he suspected of being a smuggler. The brig&rsquo;s goods were looted and the English captain (Robert Jenkins) was consequently tortured throughout that day. When the Spanish captain (Juan Le&ograve;n Fandi&ntilde;o) hacked off Jenkins&rsquo; ear with a cutlass, he bridled, &ldquo;Go tell your king that the same will happen to him if he is caught doing the same.&rdquo; Beyond the bravado or even hubris that convoked such an utterance from el capit&aacute;n, it would reaffirm the old proverb, &ldquo;Death and life are in the power of the tongue&rdquo; because this flippant threat would indeed eventually reach the truculent King George II.<br/><br/>Components: One 22&quot; x 34&quot; map &amp; 228 counters<br/><br/>S&amp;T #308, Nov-Dec 2017<br/><br/>",

        "description": "From the Designers:<br/>You are twisted.  I can&rsquo;t believe you actually want to put these adorable kittens in a blender! I guess that&rsquo;s none of my business. Maybe you&rsquo;re more of a dog person. Sure, kittens are curious by nature, but when they get in a kitchen full of dangerous appliances, it is up to you to save them.<br/><br/>This fast-paced card game has players working to save all of their own kittens before the unthinkable happens. But sometimes the only way to save your precious litter of kittens is to let those curious little cats learn the lesson of why you should never play in a Blender!<br/><br/>According to the box: A portion of the proceeds will be donated to a no kill cat shelter.<br/><br/>Objective:<br/>Save your kittens and send your opponents' kittens to The Blender.<br/><br/>Setup &amp; Play:<br/>Put the game box top on the table, open-side up and place the oversized Blender card inside, face-up: that's The Blender. Place the oversized Box card face up in the base of the box: that's The Box. Leave a little space between The Blender and The Box: that's The Counter.  Assign each player a Kitten color (red, green, blue or yellow), shuffle the deck, deal each player 6 cards and it's time to start saving adventurous kittens.<br/><br/>On each turn, players play two cards and then draw back up to 6. Kitten cards may be played into The Blender, The Counter or The Box.  All other cards are played face up in front of the player so that all players can see which cards have been played.<br/><br/>Players can play Kitties on the Move to move kittens to or from The Blender, The Counter or The Box; the number on the card specifies the number of kittens that can each be moved 1 space. Playing a Blend card will destroy the kittens currently in The Blender, save the kittens in The Box, and move the kittens on The Counter into The Blender unless countered by another player's Blend &quot;Pulse&quot; card.<br/><br/>Players can move kittens around with other cards as well. Kittens in the Blender moves all of the kittens on The Counter or in The Box to The Blender. With These Cats in the Blender a player can move all cats of a chosen color from The Counter and The Box to The Blender. Kittens in the Box moves all kittens in The Blender or on The Counter to The Box, while Cats on the Counter moves all the kittens in The Blender or The Box to The Counter.<br/><br/>Total chaos reigns when the Dog's in the Kitchen as each player gives her hand to the player in the direction indicated on the card.<br/><br/>The game ends when all 16 of the Blend cards have been played. Saved kittens are worth 2 points each, blended kitties cost 1 point each. Highest score wins.<br/><br/>Contents: 1 oversized Blender card, 1 oversized Box card, 110 playing cards (64 Kittens: 16 in each of 4 colors - red, green, blue and yellow; 18 Kitties on the Move: 6 of each number; 16 Blends: 8 Regular Blend &amp; 8 Blend Black; 4 Dogs in the Kitchen: 2 left &amp; 2 right; 2 Kittens in the Blender; 2 Your Cats in the Blender; 2 Cats on the Counter; 2 Kittens in the Box), rules.<br/><br/>",

        "description": "Battlegame Book 2.<br/>The second half of this book has 4 games with full colour A3 size boards, and monocolour pieces to cutout and assemble (most pieces are designed to standup - some fit into others pieces - such as the Knights in Tournament who may be on (in) their horses or on foot).<br/><br/>The four games are:<br/><br/>Arsouf.  2 players.  Recreate the famous battle between Richard and Saladin on September 7, 1191.  The crusaders must use their powerful knight squadrons, especially the Templars and Hospitallers, to protect their slow infantry and baggage trains.  Saladin must skilfully deploy his mamelukes, horse-archers and skirmishers to wear down the crusaders and prevent them reaching Arsouf.<br/><br/>Siege.  2 players.  Nineteen attacking knights must take a castle in 40 days.  Arrayed against them are not only 10 knights, but boiling oil, Greek fire, and rocks.  Luckily the attackers have the know how to build ladders, rams, mines, catapults and towers to help them break in.<br/><br/>Border Raiders.  2 players.  Border clashes in 13th century Germany.  Karl the Black must loot and plunder the villages of his neighbour Duke Conrad.  Clever use of archers and knights to protect the levies laden down with plunder is necessary to win this game.<br/><br/>Tournament.  2-4 players.  Three days of jousting where knights can increase their prowess is followed by the grand melee which mixes those unhorsed with those still on horseback.  Jousting involves secret choice of target and simultaneous revealing.  The grand melee rewards speed for the mounted knights and swarming for the unhorsed knights on a team.<br/><br/>",

Renju is played on a 15x15 Go board, with Go pieces.<br/><br/>The goal is the same: to get five stones in a row.  Renju has evolved rules to balance the game however: Go-Moku heavily favors the first player.<br/><br/>Renju counters this with two important rules:<br/><br/><br/>     Setup: one player places two black stones and one white stone on the board.  The other player chooses which side to play.  White places one stone, then Black places two more stones.  White removes one of these last two Black stones, then the game proceeds normally.<br/>     Restrictions: Black may not create a three-three or four-four.  (That is, a move that creates two open-ended threes at once, or two fours at once.)  Black may not create an &quot;overline&quot; - six or more stones in a row.  White is NOT thus restricted, and can win by any of those moves, OR by forcing Black to make such a move to block White.<br/><br/><br/>Renju lacks the depth of Go, but the strategies are far easier to understand, and mere mortals can become quite good at it.<br/><br/>Similar to:<br/><br/>    5ive Straight<br/>    Take 5<br/>    5 in a Row<br/>    Go-Moku<br/>    Pente<br/><br/><br/>",

Twelve wooden pins numbered 1-12 are placed in a cluster in the starting area. On a turn, a player shoots a wooden disc from the slingshot-style launcher on the open end of the board to attempt to knock down one or more pins. If a player knocks over only a single pin, the player scores points equal to the number on the pin; if the player knocks down two or more pins, the player scores points equal to the number of pins knocked down. After scoring, the player stands the pins up where they fell. Alternatively, if the player knocked over a single pin, instead of scoring points they can place this pin in one of the two defense zones near the back of the playing area.<br/><br/>If a player's score equals exactly 70 points, they win. If a player would score points and go over 70, then they instead lose points equal to the sum of the numbers on the pins, regardless of how many pins they dropped.<br/><br/>The game continues until one player reaches exactly 70 points and wins.<br/><br/>",

        "description": "Crime Zoom is a series of investigation game for 1 and more players and for plays of about 1 hour.<br/><br/>Each investigation propels you into a different universe, but almost always on a crime scene.<br/><br/>This crime scene is spread over several cards to form a great illustration. To investigate, nothing more simple. Take a card to take a closer look. An item intrigues you ? Flip the card over and find out what is this little paper on the bedside table.<br/><br/>An address ? You can now take the card that corresponds to this track. Unless another element on the crime scene appeals you even more ?<br/><br/>In Crime Zoom, you will conduct your investigation freely. Discuss between players to choose the tracks to follow. And as soon as you think you have solved the case, go to the questionnaire. Who is guilty ? What is his mobile ? What is the murder weapon ? And some subsidiary questions, of course.<br/><br/>Do not miss the culprit otherwise you will lose the game. But if you answer the questions correctly, the number of cards you will not reveal will decide you.<br/><br/>The solution will answer each of the questions. The epilogue will come to tell all this in a story or a testimony history to understand the plot that has been played.<br/><br/>Crime Zoom: No Furs is the forth case of the Crime Zoom family. It brings you in London in 2019.<br/><br/>&mdash;description from the publisher<br/><br/>",

        "description": "Onami is a strategic card game that is simple to learn, but difficult to master!<br/><br/>The concept is simple, both players draw 5 cards from a shuffled deck of 49 cards.<br/><br/>Each card in their hand will have 4 numbers on it, one number on each facing of the card. North, East, South, and West<br/><br/>The first player ( chosen randomly ) will then place a card some where on that 5 x 5 grid. Next they will place a double sided token on the card marking that they own it, with the color of their choosing facing up. They will then draw a card from the deck, signaling the end of their turn.<br/><br/>The next player will then go, doing the same thing.<br/><br/>Players may also rotate the card however they desire to get the optimal outcome.<br/><br/>If a player lays a card next to a card they do not own they can potentially take ownership of it and possibly cards next to that one and so forth!<br/><br/>Using the example below the second player, who is represented by the black token laid their card to the right of one of the first players cards, who is represented by the white token.<br/><br/>The card they laid down has a 7 on the west face of the card. The card to the left of it has a 0 on the east face of the card. Since 7 is greater than 0 the player represented by the black token can gain control of that card,<br/><br/>But wait it doesn't end there! There is also the possibility of chain reaction captures! Lets examine the sample below.<br/><br/>The card with the black token on it was just laid down by the second player, the number facing west is 3, the number on the card beside it that is owned by the first player has a number of 1 on the east side. Since 3 is greater than 1 it captures it.<br/><br/>But it doesn't end there! Since the difference between 3 and 1 is 2 the second player, represented by the black token card capture up to two cards total ( including the initial card captured ) if there are numbers on the next card that are greater than cards it is next too and that the second player doesn't already own. The ending result is as seen below.<br/><br/>Using this mechanic, even if you are woefully behind a single card can potentially bring you back in to the game!<br/><br/>There are many strategic ways to play Onami, but you must be careful to be both defensive and offensive<br/><br/>",

Players keep a hand of four tiles drawn from a common pool of 2x2 tiles. Each tile contains a mix of two or three types of chocolate squares: dark, milk, or white. Play continues with players placing tiles in turns onto the board. An extra element of game play comes from the wooden smarties which can block or enable tiles being laid in a second layer, blocking or creating connections between groups.<br/><br/>With three players, the third color is played normally, but with two or four players, the unused color has an additional play element, with surrounded groups of the neutral color scoring for the player or team who touches them most.<br/><br/>Chocoly is related to the earlier released Scho K.O. but includes a third color of chocolate, with the red smarties being divided equally among all players.<br/><br/>",

        "description": "Auf der Walz is a game that has the &quot;journeyman years&quot; as the topic. This is a tradition that dates back to medieval times and is still alive in German-speaking countries. A craftsman has to be &quot;Auf der Walz&quot; (roughly translated as &quot;on the road&quot;) for three years and one day without ever getting closer than fifty kilometers to home. The young journeyman wears a traditional dress: flared pants, waistcoat, jacket, black hat (as a symbol for freedom), the &quot;Stenz&quot; (traditional curled hiking pole), and the &quot;Charlottenburger&quot; (coarse cloth to wrap up the belongings). They work (for a little bit of money but also for board and lodge) for people on their journey.<br/><br/>Auf der Walz is a &quot;travel game&quot; with resource management that takes place in the second half of the 19th century. Like life on the Walz, it includes uncertainty and random elements. Each player earns points at the end of each year on the journey and in an end-scoring after that additional one day.<br/><br/>The engine of the game is a deck of cards. Each player has six cards per year (and an additional card for the last day) and conducts actions with them: traveling, working, finding travel mates, etc. as well as leisure activities: music, writing, painting.<br/><br/>&mdash;description from the publisher<br/><br/>",

        "description": "When Lana and her father return to their seaside hometown to help clear the debris of a big storm, Lana remembers how much she's missed the ocean &mdash; and the strong, reassuring presence of her aunt. As Lana explores the familiar beach, she discovers something incredible: a colony of aquicorns, small magical seahorse-like creatures that live in the coral reef. Lana rescues an injured aquicorn and cares for it with the help of her aunt, who may know more about these strange creatures than she's willing to admit. But when a second storm threatens to reach the town, choices made many years ago about how to co-exist with the sea start to rise to the surface. Lana realizes she will need to find the strength to stand on her own, even when it means standing up to the people who she has always relied on to protect her.<br/><br/>In the co-operative game The Aquicorn Cove Board Game, 2-4 players take on the roles of members of a small fishing village struggling to survive while maintaining a balance with the natural world. To win, the villagers must feed and grow their village, while helping to restore the health of the reef and aquatic ecosystem. The villagers are fortunate, though, and the waters of their cove are home to the beautiful and benevolent aquicorns, as well as the wondrous reef guardian Aure, who can help them both to understand the impact humans are having on the environment and to save the village.<br/><br/>",

You lose if you fail to come up with a word when the bomb explodes.<br/><br/>Similar to its older sibling Pass the Bomb this version is for younger players.  Children will easily recognize the familiar scenes on each card.<br/><br/>In turn, each player has to think of an object that might be found in the picture on the card:  for instance, if the scene is a beach, then perhaps 'sandcastle,' or &lsquo;bucket,&rsquo; or even &lsquo;whale&rsquo; might be good answers.<br/><br/>What makes this game a fun challenge is a time bomb which is passed to each player on their turn.  Be quick, because the bomb goes off at a random interval somewhere between 10 seconds and 1 minute. If you are holding the bomb when it 'explodes', you have to keep the card. The player with the least number of cards is the winner!<br/><br/>Educational and great fun for kids.  2 or more players. Ages 5 and up<br/><br/>CONTENTS: 55 Game Cards, Rules, Electronic Bomb (Batteries Included).<br/><br/>NOTE: This Junior version is significantly different than the Regular version in that the Junior version does not have a randomizing die and it features picture cards rather than letter cards.<br/><br/>",

The pass is also filled with weapons and runes to aid in defeating Endless, while allowing you to heal yourself. Combined with your action cards like attack, defend, evade, steal, and hide, you have more ways to defeat, evade, or defend against the Endless. However, whatever Endless are not defeated continue to plague the other vikings as they walk the Pass! You may also battle the other vikings. After all, you are fighting for glory and a place in Valhalla.<br/><br/>The last viking standing or the first to acquire ten glory, while surviving the turn, wins the game. If none of the players survive, then the player with most glory is declared the Conqueror in Valhalla.<br/><br/>",

        "description": "Di Renjie is a deduction card game for two to six players where the goal is to deduce the target, murder weapon, and location of an assassination before the crime takes place.<br/><br/>The Di Renjie deck of cards contains three cards for each individual target, weapon and location. At the beginning of the game, one card of each type (Target, Weapon and Location) is secretly placed under the game box. Players try to collect as many clue sets (all three matching cards of a single type) to deduce which card of each type is under the game box.<br/><br/>After eight sets are collected, the game ends when the last player finishes her turn. Each player writes her answer on a piece of paper (or mobile phone) before revealing the three cards under the game box. If players together as a team successfully deduce all three elements, each player receives points for her correct deduction and clue sets collected. The player with the most points wins. However, if the players weren't able to deduce all three aspects of the crime as a team, they fail, the murder takes place, and all players lose the game.<br/><br/>",

The Russian plan was to subdue the city with a massive show of force to intimidate its populace into submission. This approach had worked in 1991, and Moscow saw no reason why a repeat performance would not again suffice. Massive artillery and air support were not thought essential, as the long columns of tanks and their two battalions of mechanized infantry support were deemed sufficient to cower any who chose to witness.<br/><br/>Alerted to the Russians' plan of entry, two battalions of Chechen resistance fighters flitted among the sewers and rooftops to greet the Russian force. Well-armed with RPG's and mortars and backed by snipers, the defenders deployed small groups of hunter-killer teams to tackle any armor encountered. A battle for the city was set.<br/><br/>Players are cast in the roles of the commanders of each side's forces. Both players can brutally harm their opponent, while each has liabilities to protect. Opponents will be challenged to do as well, or better than, their historical counterparts.<br/><br/>Game Scale:<br/>Game Turn: 2 hours<br/>Hex: 100 - 150 yards / 62 - 137 meters<br/>Units: Infantry platoons, 2 tanks, 6 APCs<br/><br/>Game Inventory:<br/>One 22 x 34&quot; full color map<br/>One dual-side printed countersheet (280 1/2&quot; counters)<br/>One 16-page rulebook<br/><br/>Solitaire Playability: Medium<br/>Complexity Level: Low<br/>Players: 2 or more<br/>Playing Time: 2-4 hours<br/><br/>",

Players then put in turn a card on the table, *trying* to put theirs in chronological order. A player may, instead of adding a card, claim that the order in which the cards were put is incorrect. In this case all cards are turned over and the correct years revealed.<br/>If the order was correct then the doubting player receives two cards and skips a turn. If the order was incorrect then the previous player, who accepted the order as correct, receives three cards. The first player that gets rid of all the cards wins.<br/><br/>Bluffing is as least as important as knowledge in this game. Most events are rather obscure or are hard to date exactly, so this ain&rsquo;t no game for the nerds/geeks of this world, even they might think so, because it&rsquo;s full of surprises and pure fun. Highly Recommended, because Anno Domini is a blast to play, is a very enjoyable social event and you even learn something from it.<br/><br/>Unfortunately there is no English edition in existence, but this game could be a good way, to improve your already existing German skills or a very good reason, to learn the German language in the first place.<br/><br/>The Set &quot;Anno Domini - Seefahrer &amp; Flieger&quot; contains historical events related to sailors &amp; airmen, can be played as a stand alone or together with the other sets, which is the best way of playing it.<br/><br/>Part of the Anno Domini series<br/><br/>",

        "description": "Saipan &amp; Tinian, Island War Series - Volume I<br/>by Michael Taylor<br/><br/>Saipan is a simulation of the American invasion and capture of Saipan in the summer of 1944. Part of Admiral Nimitz's Operation Granite II, the seizure of the Marianas was divided into two parts, the Northern Troops Landing Force (NTLF) and the Southern Troops Landing Force (STLF). Saipan and Tinian were the objectives for the NTLF, with Saipan being the immediate objective and Tinian the second. The STLF objective was Guam. Before the Capture of Saipan both the US Navy and the Japanese Navy had powerful carrier based air forces, and with the exception of China based aircraft, no US land based aircraft could reach homeland Japan. After the capture of Saipan only the US Navy had a powerful carrier based air arm, and powerful land based bombers could now bomb Japan relentlessly.<br/><br/>Tinian is a simulation of the American invasion and capture of Tinian in the summer of 1944. Tinian was the first US Marine Corps sized shore-to-shore operation and it was the first time napalm was used against enemy troops. After its seizure Tinian was developed into the greatest B-29 base in the war. B-29s from Tinian flew 29,000 missions and dropped over 157,000 tons of bombs on Japan by the end of the war, including the two atomic bomb missions flown by the &quot;Enola Gay&quot; and &quot;Bocks Car&quot; against Hiroshima and Nagasaki.<br/><br/>Saipan Game Components:<br/>17&quot; x 22&quot; map<br/>270 Double-sided game counters<br/><br/>Tinian Game Components:<br/>11&quot; x 17&quot; map<br/>180 Double-sided counters<br/><br/>Game scale:<br/>Unit size: Platoon, Company, and Battalion<br/>Scale: Hex scale: 1/2 mile<br/>Game Turn: Each turn represents 12 hours<br/><br/>The Island War Series game system is a simulation of ground combat in the Pacific during World War II. Each game in the system represents a battle between Allied and Imperial Japanese forces on one of the many Pacific Islands.<br/>The series begins with Vol. I - Saipan/Tinian and will also include Guam - Vol. II , and Attu &amp; Kiska - Vol. III.<br/><br/>Two sets of rules are provided with each game. The first contains the Standard Rules that are common to all the games in the Pacific Island Series. The second set contains the Exclusive Rules for each game in the system, which includes Special rules, the Initial Deployment and the Reinforcement Schedule. Generally the unit scale is battalion, but there are company and platoon formations represented. The time scale, unless noted in the Exclusive rules, is 1/2 day per turn.<br/><br/>Due to the nature of the battles covered in the series, all naval and air forces are abstract. This means the main focus of each game is ground combat. The games are designed for two players, but can accommodate multiple players. For example, one player can play the US Marines, one can play the US Army, and the third plays the Japanese.<br/><br/>This series of games is loosely based on or inspired by several different game systems, including SPI's Island War series and GRD/GDW's Europa series, but many concepts are quite original. The tactical situation for the defender can be described as &quot;against the odds&quot;, which means it will be very difficult for the player playing the  defender to win the game tactically. The victory conditions are designed in such a way that the defender can win by performing better than his historical counterpart. This also puts a lot of pressure on the attacker because he cannot afford to make many mistakes.<br/><br/>Game features include:<br/>1. Limited intelligence<br/>2. Amphibious Landings<br/>3. Night rules<br/>4. Banzai attacks<br/>5. Coastal Defense units<br/>6. Beachheads and Replacements<br/>7. Fortifications<br/>8. Weather<br/><br/>",

        "description": "A competitive, low-luck, 15-minute card game for two players, focusing on the tactical nuance of a medieval duel.<br/><br/>You stand across the bloodied mud of the battlefield. Your mortal enemy is just out of range, seething with lethal intent. Only one of you will walk away; only one will be victorious. Choose your weapons, test your mettle, and cross steel with your foe in a duel to the death.<br/><br/>Clash of Steel is a tactical two-player card game of medieval duels. Every element of play is designed to explore the nuanced and complex decision-making of crossing blades, from choosing your stance to selecting your target.<br/><br/>Gameplay focuses on managing your limited stamina, predicting your opponent's actions, and whittling their defenses down until you can land a final, crushing blow.<br/><br/>The game takes about five minutes to learn and 10-15 minutes to play. There are no random elements -- the only unknown is which cards your opponent's playing and how much they're willing to spend to gain the upper hand.<br/><br/>",

        "description": "You've been looking forward to your birthday celebration for weeks. This will be the best one yet! But only if your guests arrive. Can you find them in time for the party?<br/><br/>The Birthday Burglary, title #5 in the Holiday Hijinks line, is an 18-card escape room experience for 1 or more players, and takes about 60 minutes to solve cooperatively.<br/><br/>When you have solved a puzzle, you will enter the answer into the companion web app (compatible with all smart phones and computers) and check whether you are correct. If you are, the app will tell you which card or cards to take next.<br/><br/>The app also contains a graduated hint system, so if you get stuck you can get just a small hint about the current puzzle to get moving again without giving too much away.<br/><br/>Puzzles may test your perception, wordplay, and lateral thinking. English language fluency is required.<br/><br/>Most groups take about an hour to solve the game. You can write on the cards to help solve puzzles, but this is not required and the game is otherwise non-destructible. So while you can&rsquo;t play again yourself, you could give the used game to someone else to play.<br/><br/>&mdash;description from the publisher<br/><br/>",

It depicts James Graham, the Marquis of Montrose, and his legendary string of victories over the Scottish Covenanter government during the First English Civil War (1642-1646), that would later go down in a crushing defeat. The Royalist player must recruit a Highland army and either replicate Montrose&rsquo;s victories or march into England. The Covenanter player must overcome factional infighting to defeat Montrose. Both sides must manage the tendency of conscripted units to disband after every defeat or victory.<br/>The game uses a modification of the Hand of Destiny series rules. Each player has a unique set of campaign cards generating historical events such as defection, plague, and the terrifying Highland charge, all of which affect recruitment, movement, and combat. Combat is resolved using a quasi-tactical procedure in which units take turns attacking one another.<br/><br/>&mdash;description from the publisher<br/><br/>",

At its core is a simple system for running one-on-one and small-scale combat set in the American Wild West. It is a fun game that is easy to learn and play; it combines realism, pulp fiction, and a little bit of &ldquo;Hollywood&rdquo; thrown in for good measure. Gutshot is a game that captures the spirit and mystique of the American Wild West as portrayed in movies, television, pulp novels, and comic books. It&rsquo;s the American Wild West of youth and fantasy, not a detailed recreation of history. [from the website]<br/><br/>",

The players enter the arena and cast various spells on each other trying to banish their opponents into limbo permanently. Each player has a limited amount of energy to cast offensive or defensive spells. It also costs energy to return from limbo if your wizard gets sent there for not defending against an attack. Once your energy reserves are depleted and you're banished to limbo you stay there and the remaining wizards battle until there is only one left. You may play either a black or white wizard, with your alignment affecting the casting cost of any particular spell. Each player keeps a reference chart in front of them to track the status of their wizard and compare spell effects. In the end.....&quot;There can be only one&quot;.<br/><br/>",

Between September 1st and December 19th two armies contended for the American capital, seat of the rebellion, home to the Congress, and from where independence from Great Britain had been declared only the year before. In this contest battles were fought in Delaware, New Jersey and Pennsylvania. Today roadside placards mark these places: Cooch's Bridge, the banks of the Brandywine, The Battle of the Clouds, and Germantown. For 225 years a solemn, common grave has marked the site of the Paoli Massacre. Glory attends the name of Red Bank where the hated Hessian was sent packing, and the fight for Fort Mercer where the Royal Navy suffered its worst defeat of the entire war. Fort Mifflin stands in mute testament to the patriot's naked valor; while Valley Forge remains a shrine to his devotion.<br/><br/>Yet all this could have ended on the gallows for Washington and his men, instead of the nation we call the United States of America.<br/><br/>Scale: Two miles per hex.

Your goal is to dispatch your opponents&rsquo; King or Queen! You start the game with a few powerful leaders such as Wizards and a King. A DragonLord commander allows a player to teleport and attack anywhere in the known world! The fear generated by a DragonLord with its weapon of destruction &ndash; Dragon fire, reduces the fighting effectiveness of enemy forces.<br/><br/>The adventure continues in the wastelands comprising of various places of commerce such as villages, shrines, witch dens, Dragon Lair, Teleportal and oracles. Here, quest parties may consult with witches to gain tools such as a DragonOrb to complete your quest or visit the Oracle who will enlighten adventurers with words of wisdom from the gods.<br/><br/>So what&rsquo;s new? <br/>The second edition of &ldquo;Quest for the Dragonlords&rdquo; has been re-designed with all new graphics and subtle changes to game play to deliver a much more intense gaming experience. The gameboard has been completely redesigned with lush graphics to bring the adventure element of the game to the forefront. Each player can hire heroes to help their quest parties overcome difficulties on the various quests.  <br/>The prophecy cards allow players to interact with each other during the adventure phase. The prophecy cards give clues to the players where powerful treasures may be found but they also allow players to provoke the various companions of the other players to betray their quest parties. There are 20 beautifully illustrated quest cards of drooling monsters and demons of darkness for your quest parties to overcome.  <br/>The manufacturing process has been improved from the first edition to provide highly detailed plastic miniature Orcs, Elves, Dwarves, Barbarians, Longships and DragonLords. Each civilization now has a completely unique set of spells available to their Wizards. Each player when in favour of the gods of power may gain mana. Mana is now required to cast spells and may be redeemed for powerful scroll cards that can greatly affect the outcome of battles. <br/>Drawing on the legends of Norse mythology and the intense graphics provided in the second edition of &ldquo;Quest for the DragonLords&rdquo; &ndash; A Fantasy Game of Adventure and World Conquest provides a very rich atmosphere. If you are looking for a game to provide an evening of strategy and adventure for your favourite knights of the round table, Quest for the DragonLords will be a feast for your friends.<br/><br/>There is an expansion available, called Crystal of Power, which adds the Amazones and the Nekromants, for the 5th and 6th player. Also some colored Power crystals wait to dicover on your quests through the lands.<br/><br/>",

        "description": "Lielow is a a two-player game invented by Michael Amundsen and Alek Erickson in the summer of 2021. The goal is to kill the enemy king.<br/><br/>The game is played on a chessboard and each player needs a large supply of stackable checkers in their own color. In addition, they will need one token each &ndash; called the &quot;crown&quot; &ndash; that can be placed on top of a stack to mark it as that player's king. Initially, 8 checkers of each color are placed exactly where the pawns start out in Chess. There is no king in the initial position.<br/><br/>Rules:<br/>&bull; Each turn, you move one of your stacks in a straight (orthogonal or diagonal) line a number of squares exactly equal to the size of the moved stack. (Note: The size of a stack is the number of checkers in it &ndash; not counting the crown.)<br/>&bull; If the stack lands on an empty space, it grows by the addition of 1 checker of your color.<br/>&bull; If the stack lands on an enemy stack, the enemy stack is removed and your stack shrinks down to 1 of your color (unless it was already of size 1, in which case its size simply does not change).<br/>&bull; It is not legal to land on a friendly stack.<br/>&bull; Jumping over stacks is allowed.<br/>&bull; Stacks may also jump off the board, thereby removing themselves from the game.<br/>&bull; Passing is not allowed (i.e. you must move a stack each turn).<br/><br/>The position of the crowns change throughout the game, and is determined by the following rule:<br/>&bull; After each move (both your own and your opponent's), if your biggest stack is uniquely tall among your stacks, put your crown on that stack. There is no other way the crown can change heads. The stack with a crown on it is your king.<br/><br/>You win if your opponent's king is removed from the board.<br/><br/>",

The battles are fought with dice, affected by cards played with the face down and revealed at the same time. The presence of a leader also affects the result.<br/><br/>The end of each round is marked by a Viking attack, the Vikings being the most feared warriors of that time and of the game. After that, there comes the scoring and each player receives victory points markers that he hides from the other players.<br/><br/>At the end of 8 rounds, the player with more points wins the game.<br/><br/>The challenge is to balance economic and military development, aiming at gaining the most victory points.<br/><br/>From the instructions:<br/>For 2 to 5 players ages 9 and up.<br/><br/>",

        "description": "A wheeling dealing used car game.<br/>Buy and sell cars from your used car lot.  Using your copy of the Blue book, try to make as much money as you can.  Protect your cars with various insurance and 'force' opponents to run into bad luck.<br/><br/>Each player owns a car dealership, and is trying to have the greatest value in cash and vehicle inventory when the game ends. Everyone starts out with several cars, an insurance policy (for things like theft, fire, etc), and several Dealer's Choice cards. These cards can be used for individual benefit (e.g. selling a car for list price, buy a new car for $200, etc), or they can be more insidious, such as stealing the car of someone else or setting their car on fire. A word of warning...don't play with anyone that doesn't like you! They could make your life miserable with bad Dealer's Choice cards. As the game progresses, each player buys and sells based on their unique &quot;Blue Book&quot;, which shows values for each car. These values are different for every player, so what is worth $10,000 to the seller could be junk to someone else. Obviously, everyone is trying to buy low and sell high. That is the basic idea of the game...here are a few tips!<br/>-Play with the max amount of players. Only playing with two or three people is no fun.<br/>-If you have dealer's choice cards to sell for blue book or list price, and you have a valuable car, cash in on it before someone steals it or otherwise takes it from you.<br/>-One disadvantage is near the end of the game, when all the cars are on the lots. Everyone has seen all the cars, so each round becomes redundant. It ends up being the same cars, same prices, and the same obstinate sellers. To get past this roadblock, you often have to sell some cars cheaper than you would otherwise, just to bring closure to the game.<br/><br/>",

The Healers practice their craft to Heal the injured, restoring them from the discard pile to a team.<br/><br/><br/>In Converge, players are competing to build the best team that meets the current goals, though goals and teams can shift with each play.

These goals apply to both players while the card is in the central area, with fulfilled goals remaining in play.<br/><br/>Cards can be discarded for their special ability, played to the player&rsquo;s team to fulfill goals using its suit and value, or as a new shared goal.<br/><br/>At the end of the round, players count their current star value. The player with the most stars gains control of the artifact. If they already had control of the artifact, they win! If no player can secure victory by the time all cards have been played, then the player who holds the artifact is the winner.<br/><br/>",

These quadrants are traversed by tracks with different symbols on them.<br/><br/>On their turn, each player will roll a die and move their Explorer into the track across one of the four ecosystems, advancing as many spaces as indicated by the roll.

        "description": "Make a trip back in time to the eighteenth century and play the role of the butler of the Marquis of Pombal in the management of the Palace and his farm. Important visits are to arrive ... Are you ready to receive them?<br/>This board game is not meant to be a simulation of reality but rather a game that provides fun, healthy living but also the Palace as a historical and cultural monument.<br/>It also focuses some of the farm's old activities and also draws attention to the beauty of the building, its Gardens, the Cascade of the Poets, the House of Fishing, the wine and olive oil mills.<br/>The characters in this game are historical figures that have crossed in a way or another with the Palace, but the main figure is the Palace itself. Since chronological data were not taken into account, these characters may not have been simultaneously in the palace.<br/>Sebasti&atilde;o Jos&eacute; de Carvalho e Melo (Marquis of Pombal) was in his Palace in Oeiras, more precisely in the Fishing House, enjoying his precious leisure time when he finds out that his butler had shuffled his agenda. Some important visitors are coming to the Palace but no one knows who or when will arrive first...<br/>The player will play the role of a candidate for the new butler of the Marques. He will have to lead a team of workers in the preparation services of the respective places to properly receive visitors.<br/>The workers are in the Staff House and will be paid for their services.<br/>The attention will be focused on the locations where the visitors (characters) are welcomed. The player has to perform some maintenance and services but will also have to explore Farm's resources (Olive, Grapes, Mulberry / Silkworms) in order to produce olive oil, Carcavelos wine and silk cocoons.<br/>It is necessary to produce in order to generate money (exportation through Lage Creek), and at the same time to be a good host to your visitors (characters) so that the player can be rewarded with the characters&rsquo; favors (special actions of the characters) in order to get the highest score to win the game.<br/>O Pal&aacute;cio do Marqu&ecirc;s (The Palace of the Marquis) is a worker placement board game for 2 to 4 players.<br/><br/>",

        "description": "This game is 'Chess-like' in many ways: two players have identical sets of game pieces starting on opposite sides of a square grid. Players move one piece per turn and can eliminate the other player's pieces by moving into their space. Movement options depend on which piece it is you're moving. In a fit of conspicuous difference, it's the black side who makes the opening move here.<br/><br/>The central gimmick is that each piece is composed of two parts, a body and a head. The height of the body determines how far a piece can move (one, two or three spaces), whereas the head determines the directions: straight lines (like rooks), diagonals (like bishops), or both (like kings or queens). Each side also has one super-powered queen/rook hybrid which can move to any space within the range determined by its body, and even one unbeatable but immobile head.<br/><br/>There's a reason for all this separation into bodies and heads: after every move the piece which just moved must swap heads with a different type of head, chosen by the player from their pieces still in play.<br/><br/>There are two victory conditions: either you move one of your pieces to a specific target square on the far side of the board, or you force your opponent to make an illegal move. Draws are possible, but rare (they require both sides' forces to be extremely depleted).<br/><br/>The theme is pretty much irrelevant - this is an abstract at heart. The rulebook frames the game as the secret strategy-honing tool of the nobles in a fictional culture, and the rules introduction is presented in dialogue form with the Wise Old Master teaching the game to his Young Noble Student, but none of this is at all relevant to gameplay. In fact, the game presented within the fiction is themeless and, quite literally, abstract: the pieces' names are translated as abstract concepts like 'strength' etc.<br/><br/>",

Players must then decide whether to stop and score or draw another die, roll again, and risk it all!<br/><br/>Each letter and die has a point value similar to Scrabble. The twist is in the multiplication of your score by the number of letter dice used.<br/><br/>In each round, the player begins by rolling one die. The player uses that die and nine wooden tiles to make a single word. The player can stop there and score, or bank the used tiles to score later, take an additional die, roll both dice, and make a new word with the remaining tiles. This new word will now be scored with a multiplier of 2 (with 2 dice). Players can continue with this adding dice and making words as long as they have tiles left. If a player fails to make a word, they score only their banked tiles with no multipliers.<br/><br/>",

        "description": "Operation Shoestring: The Guadalcanal Campaign, 1942, is an Operational level board-wargame covering the air, land, and sea battles between the United States Army, Navy, and Marine Corps and the forces of the Japanese Empire on and around Guadalcanal Island in 1942. The unit scale is company-level for the ground game and squadron-level for the air forces. Naval counters represent one ship for carriers and battleships, two ships for cruisers, and destroyer flotillas.<br/><br/>&quot;We struck at Guadalcanal to halt the advance of the Japanese. We did not know how strong he was, nor did we know his plans. We knew only that he was moving down the island chain and that he had to be stopped ... From that moment in 1942, the tide turned, and the Japanese never again advanced.&quot; -- Maj. Gen. Alexander A. Vandegrift, USMC, Commanding General, 1st Marine Division<br/><br/>The strategic situation at the time found both sides relatively equal in strength for one of the few times in the war. After the surprise attack on Pearl Harbor and the ensuing string of rapid conquests, Japanese fortunes had taken a turn for the worse. At the Battle of Coral Sea, American carrier-based air power fought to a draw with the vaunted Japanese, serving notice that the Japanese would not be allowed to project naval power with impunity. Later, the Battle of Midway saw four Japanese carriers sunk, evening the odds in the Pacific and laying the groundwork for the first American offensive of the Pacific War.<br/><br/>The Japanese, having been blunted at Midway, turned their attention to the south, extending a siring of bases southeast through the Solomons chain. They established a seaplane base at Tulagi, and began construction of a large airfield on the island of Guadalcanal. Air pow- er based at these airfields would be able to effectively threaten American supply lines between the west coast and Australia. Shocked by the news of the Japanese airfield construction in the Solomons, the American high command gathered all available marine forces for a strike at Guadalcanal. The main force was the American First Marine Division assembled at Wellington, New Zealand. This Division, understrength and less than half trained, would bear the brunt of driving the Japanese from Guadalcanal.<br/><br/>As the morning of August 7, 1942 dawned, weeks of boredom for the Marines and occasional skirmishes for the air forces were replaced by real battle. The Marines went ashore, first at Tulagi, then Guadalcanal, and finally at Gavutu/Tanambago. The Japanese, caught unprepared by the audacious amphibious assaults, nevertheless recovered quickly and sent air, land, and naval forces to Guadalcanal. The resulting clashes shaped the future of the war in the Pacific.<br/><br/>Operation Shoestring simulates this fascinating campaign &amp; includes special rules to simulate such unique aspects of the battle as: Innovative combat resolution, integrating maneuver combat, close assault, artillery bombardment, shore bombardment, air support, and even Banzai charges into one easy-to-use system. Full-featured naval and air game that integrates with the island fighting. Engineers to rebuild airfields and construct improved positions. Japanese hidden units and limited U.S. intelligence.<br/><br/>Operation Shoestring can be played by one to four players. Solitaire play is possible with a slight modification to the naval rules, while team play is easily accommodated with one player commanding the ground forces and one the air and naval forces for each side. An introductory scenario, several short scenarios, and a grand campaign game allow players to experience the battle for Guadalcanal over a variety of time spans.<br/><br/>Game Scale:<br/>Game Turn: 3.5 days<br/>Hex: 1 mile / 1.6 kilometers<br/>Units: Battalion to Army<br/><br/>Game Inventory:<br/>One 22 x 34&quot; full color map<br/>Three dual-side printed countersheets (600 1/2&quot; counters)<br/>One 24-page Operation Shoestring rulebook<br/>Six single-side printed player aid cards<br/>One 10-sided die<br/>One counter storage tray<br/><br/>Solitaire Playability: High<br/>Complexity Level: High<br/>Players: 2 or more<br/>Playing Time: 1-30 depending on scenario<br/><br/>",

A simple card game themed on the famous comic graphic novels, with indomitable Gauls bashing unfortunate Romans. Players have a set of cards (Asterix, Obelix, Getafix, Cacofonix &amp; Vitalstatistix) numbered 1 to 10, each card having a different combination of 1-4 magic potions to act as a tie-break. A deck of 55 Roman soldiers, ranging from the cook to Crismus Bonus &amp; Julius himself, are competed for in turn. A scoring card is shown, players select their Gaul cards and show them together, highest wins the Roman and discards their winning card. The other players return their cards to their hands to fight again. There are also Pirate cards which reduce your winnings and Dogmatix cards which allow the players to draw from the deck and either keep the card themselves or pass it onto another player. The rank of the Roman increases your score, but combinations of the same rank are worth much more.<br/><br/>Re-implemented by:<br/><br/>    The Gnumies <br/><br/><br/>",

        "description": "Dawn of Battle is a hex-and-counter wargame allowing players to refight historical battles from roughly 1500 BCE to 1500 CE or 3000 years of combat. Players take the roles of the great commanders of history, including Xerxes, Alexander the Great, Julius Caesar, Saladin, and William Wallace.<br/><br/>The game system is straight-forward and action-packed, as players depend upon the quality of their army&rsquo;s leadership to provide activation points allowing them to maneuver their armies and strike against the enemy. The better an army&rsquo;s command, the more flexibility it has to move, rally, and attack.<br/><br/>Also included are supplementary rules that cover free deployment in scenarios, barbarian charges, command control and impetuousity, elephant panic, and random events.<br/><br/>Each of the twenty included scenarios indicate the disposition of each army that engaged at that historical battle. Units include a variety of infantry types (including hoplites and the Macedonian phalanx), cavalry (including chariots and mounted archers), missile units (including slingers, longbows, and even early gunpowder weapons), and special units such as elephants and war wagons.<br/><br/>The game&rsquo;s primary engine is comprised of an action deck used to determine command, the randomly determined outcomes of actions, and melee combat. Additionally, action cards provide special effects that players can use to enhance their units&rsquo; abilities as well as the narrative of the gaming experience. The action deck provides a unique means of resolving a battle in an experience that will never be duplicated.<br/><br/>-description from designer<br/><br/>",

Taking on the roles of Naruto, Sakura, Kakashi, Rock Lee, Sai and Shikamaru from the Hidden Leaf Village, players attempt to stop the Akatsuki from extracting the tailed beasts from their bearers and using them to power their ultimate weapon: The Ged&ocirc; Maz&ocirc;.<br/><br/>In more detail, the Akatsuki start at one of the nine villages on the game board, spend at most three turns in that village, then (if they're not defeated there) move to the next village. Each Akatsuki character has its own strengths and weaknesses. The villages are distant from one another, so players can't race from one village to another after them, but must divide their forces to prepare for conflict, encountering unexpected events along the way.<br/><br/>Each player has a character card showing Combat Ability, Chakra Reserve, and Strategy Value, as well as an experience track that allows them to power up over time. Each character also has a deck of fourteen ability cards, some common to each deck but most unique to that character.<br/><br/>Each turn a character takes two actions from move, meditate, or fight. When you fight, you roll dice, hoping for shuriken. You can play cards to increase the number of dice you roll, but you must spend Chakra to play them and both cards and Chakra are limited. The enemy fights back if you don't deal enough damage to it, possibly triggering special powers and additional effects in the process.<br/><br/>Once the Akatsuki arrive at Hidden Leaf Village, players must face Tobi and the Ged&ocirc; Maz&ocirc;, with their power being greater for each tailed beast that they stole on their way to this final showdown.<br/><br/>Naruto Shippuden: The Board Game features three levels of play and a large variety of enemies, making each game a unique experience.<br/><br/>",

The game is divided into missions, each with several chapters. Players are divided into two teams and will battle each other to achieve their respective goals in each chapter. The winning team earns bonuses for the final battle, a face-off between the two teams to decide the fate of the world!<br/><br/>With many beloved characters from the DC Universe, every mission is heavily inspired by well-known stories from our favorite team of superheroes! Take control of Batman, Wonder Woman and the rest of the Justice League to fight against Darkseid, Lex Luthor and many other villains with the Hero team. Or use your many resources to achieve your evil plan with the Villain team, with the help of Joker, Black Manta, Cheetah and many others. The player controlling Batman, for example, needs to manage their hand of cards that represents the gadgets in his utility belt, while the player using Superman will unleash his incredible, almost uncontrollable powers, by rolling dice. Other heroes like the Flash have to manage their action points each turn to perform the best action combination that will lead their team to victory.<br/><br/>The characters have their own set of skills that give them the edge needed to complete their goals, with customized mechanisms to control characters, giving a unique feel to each hero during gameplay to better show off their incredible powers.<br/><br/>Each mission can be played as a full campaign, tackling each chapter and the final battle in one session, but by using the &quot;save system&quot; included in the game, you can play each chapter separately and easily save your progress.<br/><br/>&mdash;description from the publisher<br/><br/>",

You have elite Counter Terrorism Service troops supported by army, police and militia units. You can also call on Coalition air assets and special forces to give you the edge. Combat is brutal and unpredictable. The city is full of IEDs, ISIS fighters, and innocent civilians.<br/><br/>You must plan carefully, take advantage of your freedom to deliver strikes against enemy territory at will, but also be warned that you can lose the game, even on the last turn, as your casualties mount and ISIS counterattack your exposed troops.<br/><br/>&mdash;description from the publisher<br/><br/>",

        "description": "Feralis is a dark and brutal plane of existence, populated by numerous tribal races and civilizations in continuous tension between them, under the influence of mysterious and feared archaic deities the Aesyr. The card game Feralis calls the player to impersonate one of these cryptic and extraordinary gods. The Aesyr can make arrangements or dominate creatures that inhabit Feralis and force them into battle against other gods. Power, glory, boredom, it is not clear why these eternal gods continue to confront and murder each other, but no one has the memory of a time when the world of Feralis was not accompanied by the incessant rhythm of the colossal armies they summoned.<br/><br/>Feralis is a deck construction card game for battles 1vs1, 2vs2 and solo. The ultimate goal is to kill your opponents, to do so you have to recall your creaturs, mutate them, and use them to slay the creatures that stand in the opponent's area or go directly to the head of their leader.<br/><br/>In Feralis, the players have a deck of creatures, a Aesyr that impersonates, and a series of Godlike Skills assigned to the god. The creature cards have 2 sides, a &quot;Call&quot; side and an &quot;Awakening&quot; one. To put them on the battlefield you have to wait for their waiting cost in turns. Once your creatures on the &quot;Call&quot; side are defeated they will come back in the &quot;Awakening&quot; form. You can also play them directly in the &quot;Awakening&quot; form but you will miss the opportunity to see their &quot;Call&quot; form.<br/><br/>Your main resource is time, you have to put the creature at the right moment to create a powerful combo between your creature. You can reduce the time cost with a limited resource the Catalyst. You have a short amount that you can use also during your opponent's turn to unlock your creature in the Incubator area.  You can support your creatures with your Godlike skills, powerful events that need time to be ready but they can turn the tide of battle. This Skills will recharge once used. Use all these resources wisely and have no mercy, your opponents will not.<br/><br/>-description from designer<br/><br/>",

        "description": "House of Normandy is a &quot;quad&quot; centered on the dynastic struggles of William the Conqueror's extended family, and the second game in the SHIELDS &amp; SWORDS II series. The earliest of the four battles collected herein saw two of William's sons duking it out. The other three battles are all drawn from the reign of Stephen of Blois, the Conqueror's grandson, and the long period of instability and intermittent civil war that has come to be called The Anarchy. During the twelfth century, armies tended to avoid giving battle to one another, and when it did come to blows, neither side exhibited much endurance; there's none of that &quot;they fought from sunrise to sunset&quot; stuff here. Nor was anyone involved particularly renown for any special military genius. As a result, the battles here are short, small, and uncomplicated affairs, ideal both for solitaire study, and for a quick game with a friend. That's not to say the battles are lacking in flavor, however, as each brings something unique to your table.<br/><br/>The Battle of Tinchebray (1106) gives each player Wings composed of both cavalry and foot soldiers, and arrayed in echelons. S &amp; S vets know that horse and non-horse units don't support the other's attacks, which makes things tricky. The battle turns on the timely (or not) arrival of a hidden English Wing.<br/><br/>The Battle of the Standard (1138) is a matter of English quality versus Scots quantity. The English have a good defensive position, and are mostly arrayed into a single Wing (with all the pluses and minuses that come with it). Successive waves of Scots will usually be forced to attack the English piecemeal. The English have the advantage in the early game, but the longer the game runs, the more Scottish numerical superiority will rule the day. To recreate the spectacularly lopsided victory that the English enjoyed historically, the English player will have to seal the deal in the early going.<br/><br/>The Battle of Lincoln (1141) might be described as a game of &quot;press your luck&quot; for poor King Stephen. He has some good units, but as soon as one Wing defects, the others might follow, turning an even contest into a slaughter. His Angevin opponent must make good use of not only his horse, but also his Welsh infantry, which is fearsome but brittle.<br/><br/>The Battle of Wilton (1143) commences at dusk, and ends at nightfall. This means the battle has a time pressure element, quite unusual for the S&amp;S system. Neither player knows exactly when the battle is going to end. Will the Blesevins break through the Angevin line, or will Stephen's retreat be covered by his gallant rearguard?<br/><br/>The SHIELDS &amp; SWORDS II series builds on, and improves, the Shields &amp; Swords series of games (We Happy Few, Stamford Bridge, A Hill Near Hastings, and Our Royal Bones), with a greater variety of unit types, revised suppression rules, and a new D8-based CRT. S&amp;S II revolves around the activation of Wings using double-sided Command Markers, with a flexible scale and simple, easy-to-teach rules.<br/><br/>",

Unlike other North Africa wargames, there are 5 mini-maps located at the various termini of maneuver in the campaign, and where battles are waged as fascinating mini-games in their own right. Players try to sweep each map and force the action onto the next one in an effort to push their opponent out of the game.<br/><br/>The looming Malta factor is accounted for most assiduously. While abstracted into many aspects of the game, players must always be mindful of Malta being made active (helping the Allies) or inactive (assisting the Axis). The Italian forces have their rightful place in the story unfolding on the game board, and the remarkable paucity of units turns every counter and hex into the kind of wargaming puzzle reminiscent of the glory days of those great contests from the Avalon Hill General magazine.<br/><br/>The use of Supply Point markers, received in a fast, hassle-free way, to seize the initiative, replace losses and recover shattered formations, to light up a map and begin operations there (i.e., conduct player turns on it of maneuver and combat), and then to continue those player turns for another round. Each additional round of player turns must be paid for by another Supply Point, usually spent by the side that feels it is advantageous to press on and keep the opponent hard pressed, recreating simply and effectively the lulls and starts in battlefield operations that were a signature of this campaign.<br/><br/>The desert lies before you and World War II is at stake.

        "description": "Dux Britanniarum is a table top miniatures wargame by the Too Fat Lardies.<br/><br/>Dux Britanniarum is a set of rules for wargaming and campaigning in the Age of Arthur. Covering the period 450AD to 600AD the rule book combine all you need to fight tabletop games and to run a virtually paper-free campaign.<br/><br/>The rules are designed to be played with relatively small forces. A Saxon starter Army is just 38 figures, a British starter army is only 44 figures, both of which can be purchased from our web site in 28mm although the rules play just as well with larger or smaller figures. Forces are grouped into six figures for most warriors and four figures for skirmish and missile troops or cavalry. The tabletop rules are D6 based and simple to use, with the single page playsheet on the rear cover of the rules covering 99% of situations. Activation is determined by a speedy card driven system where all units get to act in any single turn.<br/><br/>Included with the rules is an A3 pull out map of Britian in around 450AD which provides the background setting to the Dux Britanniarum campaign. Your characters start their campaign as a Saxon Lord or a Romano-British Tribune and will attempt to gain fortune and reputation on the battlefield as you fight to defend or conquer a Romano-British kingdom. Included with the rules are four detailed maps which together cover moderd Britain, Wales and lowland Scotland along with an historical background to each kingdom.<br/><br/>A character generation system will add colour to your campaign as your Nobles assume their own personalities. The terrain and scenario generator allows games to be set up quickly and to result in an almost infinite variety of games to keep you challenged and enjoying the action. The tabletop rules provide for a fast play system with a fun and exciting narrative as your Nobles lead their men into battle. The unique three phase battle system and force morale mechanism allows you to fight your battles with a minimum of preparation and tie those results into the campaign system for a really exciting and fun gaming experience.<br/><br/>",

Throughout the game, these units are moved around the board &mdash; a 4x4 grid of locations, each with their own effects &mdash; to attack opposing units and score points, while cards are used to manipulate the game a variety of ways.<br/><br/>The three action cards correspond to the three different unit types &mdash; Infantry, Cavalry, and Engine &mdash; and along with the turn sequence card, they drive the game through round-based game play in which each player in a round receives three turns, but never the same three actions as the other player.<br/><br/>Players score points for destroying an opposing unit, playing two or more cards during their turn, having both units survive the round, and controlling the vast inland Sawgrass Sea. The game ends when a player has scored 12 or more points at the end of the round, with the player who scores the most points winning.<br/><br/>&mdash;description from the publisher<br/><br/>",

Another deck contains 28 all-different &quot;Target&quot; cards, each of which describes a meld and a point value, the more difficult melds having a higher point value. Five Target cards are dealt face up for all to see. Players draw and discard as in rummy. When a player lays down the meld shown on one of the Target cards, they win that Target card, and score the points. A new Target card is then dealt to replace it, so the melds change all the time! What's more, players can (and do!) win 2 or more Target cards on a single play by laying down groups of Playing cards which make the melds on 2 or more Target cards.

Your ultimate goal is to gain fame and fortune by being the first cryptozoologist credited with the actual discovery of a new species, making you world famous. Somehow you have landed yourself smack dab in the middle of feud between Bigfoot and Yeti so it's time to choose your side as it will help shape the fate of your research and ultimately your success!<br/><br/>During each turn in the game, players draw from either the Unknown (deck) or from the top of Tabloids (discard pile). Each player mounts or joins expeditions for the various cryptids in the hope of reaching ten or more points in play. If ten or greater points is achieved that expedition would be considered to have found enough proof for science to take notice, thereby doubling that expedition's score. Also during each turn a single Action card may be played which can do things like strengthen the value of an expedition in play, retrieve cards from the Tabloids or manipulate other facets of the game. Each cryptid has an ability that will help you in some way and is triggered when you play them. At the end of a round, cards in the Tabloids that match expeditions in play discredit that expedition. The game also has a shutout rule involving Extraterrestrials that, if achieved, prevents all other players from scoring that round.<br/><br/>",

        "description": "Makruk (Thai: หมากรุก) (or Thai chess) is a board game descended from the 6th century Indian game of Chaturanga or a close relative thereof, and therefore related to chess. It is regarded as the most similar living game to this common ancestor of all chess variants.<br/><br/>The name is pronounced /m&agrave;kr&uacute;k/, with a tone pattern of low-high. Makruk is popular in Thailand and Cambodia. In these countries the game is more popular than chess. There are around two million Thais who can play Makruk, of which about 5000 also play chess.<br/><br/>The information from <a target='_blank' href=\"http://www.wikipedia.org\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer noopener\">www.wikipedia.org</a><br/><br/>Makruk opening setup is similar to international Chess, except that the pawns start on the third rank and the King of each side is always on the left of the Queen. The queen moves just one square diagonally (like the queen in medieval chess), and the bishop moves one square in any diagonal direction or straight ahead.<br/><br/>Online Play<br/><br/><br/>     <a target='_blank' href=\"http://www.schemingmind.com\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer noopener\">http://www.schemingmind.com</a> (turn-based)<br/>     <a target='_blank' href=\"http://www.thaibg.com/\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer noopener\">http://www.thaibg.com/</a><br/>     <a target='_blank' href=\"http://jocly.com/#/play/makruk\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer noopener\">http://jocly.com/#/play/makruk</a> (AI, live, turn-based)<br/><br/><br/>",

This is known as &quot;The Treasure of Moon Gold&quot;, and a single piece of it would be worth millions. Your role will be to lead the search for the legendary treasure that was thought to be only a legend until a Professor found proof of its existence and a way to find it.<br/><br/>But you're not the only one who wants to get your hands on the treasure. An unknown group is chasing the professor and she has had no choice but to hide and flee, for that reason she has sent you, the best treasure hunter, everything you need to find the hidden temple where the legendary treasure awaits.<br/><br/>In this journey you will not be alone, the teacher's faithful assistant will accompany you wherever you need: in the heart of the jungle, in the middle of a desert or in the depths of the sea. He will always be ready to lend you a hand and get you out of trouble, although due to his clumsiness and his forgetfulness, it is likely<br/><br/>The adventure will be divided into 4 chapters. Each one will take place in a different part of the world with a totally different objective and tests that can be completed in an hour, like a traditional Escape Room. You can play them all at once or manage them in different days.<br/><br/>",

While beating a monster gives points and potential bonuses in future rounds, not beating it gives a player first dibs on getting the replacement adventurer cards, giving an advantage in future challenges.<br/><br/>Each monster has a different rule for beating it, and players bid adventurer cards in turn &mdash; sometimes face up, sometimes face down &mdash; to fight it. The rules might be the highest card in a certain suit, or most cards that have a certain skill, or the sum of all cards the player has.<br/><br/>In the end, the player who slays the final dragon receives bonus points, then everyone sums their loot and points, with the player who has the highest total winning.<br/><br/>",

Paragraphs are read in sequence as determined by the rules and tables, describing new situations, locations and characters, providing clues and throwing red herrings in your path in your pursuit of the truth. Each game will provide a new playing experience, since no two games will play out the same way.<br/><br/>SHDSG is comprised of three booklets: The Adventures of Sherlock Holmes (comprised of Rules and Adventures), The Casebook of Sherlock Holmes and The Memoirs of Sherlock Holmes. You will need all three booklets and a few 6-sided dice (d6) to play the game. Future expansions will be available to supplement the rules, develop existing cases and solve new crimes.<br/><br/>You will read various numbered sections one after another but the sequence of paragraphs is determined by rules and tables. Each describes a new situation, or provides rules about the choices and actions you can make. There are plenty of events and situations, so each game will be a new, fresh experience. Ultimately it is also about your skill as a role player to piece the elements together.<br/><br/>SHDSG is an adventure game played in turns. A standard turn starts with you selecting an Action, such as Exploring, Planning or Investigating before. Generally in an Adventure, you will try to defeat a Villain. This is done by gaining Clue events to find out what has been happening and then reveal the Villain. Once you know the identity of the Villain you must try to discover their Motive and gain enough insight to Arrest them for their crimes!<br/><br/>This game is free to download as a series of PDFs in the file section.<br/><br/>",

Madero prepares an uprising with the phrase &quot;effective suffrage, no re-election&quot;.<br/>Tierra y Libertad is a cooperative game, take a place at the table, you will take the role of one of the rebel factions and together they will try to change the Constitution of the country so that it includes the demands of the people.<br/>To achieve this, notable revolutionaries will join your faction, you will also need plans that represent historical events, which are activated with resources (troops, weapons, revolutionary ideas and political power) that you get in different regions of Mexico. The combats are the order of the day, and the actions of the factions do not always help the cause. Players should carefully plan their planning so as not to be crushed by the conservative machinery.<br/>If the players manage to reach the fourth round and also all together make 100 or more victory points then they will have won as a team and a new and inclusive Constitution will now govern the country's destiny.<br/>Otherwise, if objectives of victory points are not met at the end of each round or at the end of the fourth round the factions do not reach or pass the 100 victory points then the counterrevolutionaries will have won, the flame of the Revolution will be extinguished and the course to prosperity will be conducted with the rules of yesteryear.<br/><br/>",

        "description": "The world of Earthshine is broken. The chasm has brought on many new challenges and we hope you can help us solve them. Join us in the underworld to gain the glory you deserve.<br/><br/>Chain Mail: Adventures of Earthshine is a 1-4 player solo/cooperative adventure game where your goal is to complete a quest before time runs out. A party of four heroes face monsters and terrain that might slow them down, but each deploys unique abilities to overcome seemingly insurmountable odds. The game takes place in Earthshine, a world that has been literally torn open by a giant meteor. The chasm that has formed has become a new world for exploration, adventure and danger. Our characters have joined up to take on quests below the surface.<br/><br/>Chain Mail consists of a base set of rules, tokens, and cards, which are then complemented by map, monster, quest, and treasure cards -- one each -- and four hero character cards. The modular design of the game allows for thousands of scenario combinations and a rich depth of party creation and combination.<br/><br/>Regardless of the setup, each consists of the party working in unison. First they decide to stay or move. Then they roll for trouble, and either battle or adventure. Afterwards, they wrap everything up -- distribute treasure, tend to their wounds -- to end the turn. But the characters REALLY come to life during battle and adventure phases, showing off their special skills and mechanics to create radically different play experiences.<br/><br/>Every adventure and every party is different; it's up to YOU to guide your intrepid heroes to glory! ...or failure.<br/><br/>&mdash;description from the publisher<br/><br/><br/>Starter Kit was released in January 2019 for Board Game of the Month Club subscribers.<br/><br/>",

Using fluid and dynamic systems for integrating the fierce combat and rapid movements of the companies and battalions contesting the beaches, cliffs, swamps and bocage bordering the rough North Sea coast, players will find the easy rules to offer rich puzzles and surprising opportunities on the cross-map march to victory.<br/><br/>On the two western beachheads, the Americans faced problems galore and some of the worst terrain encountered by the Allies. It seemed that Murphy&rsquo;s Law was in full effect: &ldquo;Everything that can go wrong will go wrong &ndash; and at the worst possible moment.&rdquo; Yet despite widely scattered air drops, confusion and stiff German resistance, an American victory was won and the beaches secured.

        "description": "From the publisher's web page:<br/><br/>Taking Soldier Kings as its base, Soldier emperor covers the Napoleonic Wars in Europe, 1803-1815. There are 180 huge and thick playing pieces like those in Granada, 165 smaller marker pieces, two large hard-mounted game boards like that in Granada, and 64 cards.<br/><br/>The map stretches from Britain to Persia, North Africa to Norway. Europe is divided into areas, each of them rated for their resources, manpower potential, and defense value. Armies move along the routes that connect these areas, and the object of the game is to conquer and hold as much territory as you can. Soldier Emperor is very true to history but is easily playable by anyone with an interest in games or history.<br/><br/>This is probably the first time that Persia has appeared in a Napoleonic wargame, but the Persians fought the Russians twice in this period and also threatened war with the Turks. They receive two armies, plus their fine leader, Crown Prince Abbas Mirza.<br/><br/>Turkey's eastern border regions are shown as well: Kurdistan and Baghdad appear. Unlike other games, the Turkish player can't operate with a secure right flank but must worry about his or her &quot;back door.&quot; The Turks begin with rather mediocre leadership, Ebubekir and Bayrakdar on land and Seyit Ali on the sea. But once Sultan Selim is overthrown (an event brought about by card play), Turkish leadership improves as junior generals are promoted. The Turks also can deploy the Banner of the Prophet, using Mohammed's ancient flag to inspire their troops.<br/><br/>Austria has a large army, one good general for most of the game (Archduke Charles) and a slim chance to receive an excellent one (Radetzky) and another good one (Frimont) late in the game. The rest of the Austrian generalship is not so good, and the empire is surrounded by potential enemies.<br/><br/>Prussia is small and relatively weak, but does have two fair generals (Yorck and Bl&uuml;cher) and a good army. But if the army is lost in action Prussia's low resources and manpower will make the losses difficult to replace.<br/><br/>France of course has Napoleon, some other very good generals, and the largest army in the game. The French player also has the Imperial Guard. France has a powerful economy and strong starting position &ndash; and a large target painted right on the French player's back. France's revolutionary ways bring its player a number of game advantages (in movement and battle) and some disadvantages as well (in diplomacy, at least until France's enemies have been beaten into submission).<br/><br/>Britain has the expected advantages: large income from overseas trade, a powerful fleet, and Lord Nelson. They also have a couple of lesser admirals (Collingwood and Jervis) and the outstanding Duke of Wellington to lead the land forces. But the army is small, and hard to replace if lost.<br/><br/>Spain can call out guerrillas if invaded, and will need every advantage to offset its weak economy, poor generalship and second-rate army. The fleet is good, and Gravina is a good admiral. Spain also has access to several minor countries that others can't easily reach, and a starting position in Italy that can allow for quick expansion (Etruria, held by a Spanish prince in 1803).<br/><br/>Russia, the final player-controlled country, has a vast land area, a strong position on the edge of the board, and a large and strong army. Leadership is good, with Kutusov and Kamensky the best of the lot plus Senyavin to command the fleet. But as in Soldier Kings, the Russian player will be chronically short of cash and willing to do many things to change this.<br/><br/>As in Soldier Kings, the game can be played with fewer than seven players, all the way down to two. Card play drives the action, with players able to play cards at any time and thwart their opponents' plans. Play order is determined by each country's initiative, and generals and admirals move their forces from area to area. And like Soldier Kings, combat is simple to resolve but contains many wrinkles of strategy.<br/><br/>If you liked Soldier Kings, you'll adore Soldier Emperor. Play is fast and furious, strategies are many, and the excitement level is high. A game lasts about four hours, with the campaign game taking somewhat longer.<br/><br/>",

        "description": "Four Factions vying with each other to mold earth into their own vision. The Robotech Defense Force (RDF) seeks to keep the peace between Zentraedi civilians and humans. The Zentraedi Rebellion (ZR) wants to radicalize the Zentraedi civilians to join their rebellion to enslave humanity and the Earth. Tired of RDF military control and martial law, the Anti-Unification League (AUL) strives to rebuild thriving cities independent from the RDF. Fearing an impending alien attack on earth, the Robotech Expeditionary Force (REF) works to unite earth&rsquo;s population behind the RDF in preparation for earth&rsquo;s future defense.<br/><br/>To win, you must lead your faction to meet its goals before other factions achieve their own goals. You have a half-ally, a half-enemy, and a full enemy. You must work carefully to ensure you can reach your goals, but also ensure that no other Faction can stop you.<br/><br/>The 3 to 4 player game consists of up to 4 rounds. At the start of a turn, a player can can trade one event card with another player. Next players play 1 Event Card. Each Event Card is tied to a Faction, enabling that faction to take additional actions that round. After the Event Card's actions are completed, the player gets to Take Command to undertake two actions. Actions available are limited if the player elected on their turn to play their own Faction&rsquo;s Event Card before Taking Command.<br/><br/>Players gain random and predetermined Event Cards as<br/>the game progresses. After all players / Factions in a round complete their turn, there is a Resolution Phase where all Factions get to take additional actions.<br/><br/>&mdash;description from the publisher<br/><br/>",

        "description": "Dungeon in a Tin is a solo or cooperative dungeon-hack. Players descend into a dungeon randomly laid-out from a stack of tiles, fighting through the orc and goblin hordes to rescue the kidnapped maiden and collect treasure and glory.<br/><br/>Each player takes turns to move through the dungeon one tile at a time, laying new tiles as unexplored areas are entered; every time a player enters a room, special monster dice are rolled to determine the enemies faced and the potential loot to be found. When a monster attacks, a die is rolled to determine the style of their attack; the player then chooses a card from his hand to counter with, each card being strong against some kinds of attack and weak against others.<br/><br/>The ultimate goal of the game is for the players to fight their way to the bottom of the dungeon to rescue the captured maiden - and then fight their way out with her. The dungeon will become harder to fight through as the player delves deeper, and then harder still on the way out with a helpless rescuee in tow.<br/><br/>This Print-and-Play game was an entry in the 'One Full-sheet Label' design contest here on BGG, and as such the printed components fit entirely on a single label sheet. A small number of other tokens and blank dice will also be required. Additionally, as the name hints, once constructed on cardstock it is possible to fit the game inside an Altoids tin or similar.<br/><br/>",

        "description": "In Bohnanza, you plant, then harvest bean cards in order to earn coins. Each player starts with a hand of random bean cards, and each card has a number on it corresponding to the number of that type of beans in the deck. Unlike in most other cards games, you can't rearrange the order of cards in hand, so you must use them in the order that you've picked them up from the deck &mdash; unless you can trade them to other players, which is the heart of the game.<br/><br/>On a turn, you must plant the first one or two cards in your hand into the &quot;fields&quot; in front of you. Each field can hold only one type of bean, so if you must plant a type of bean that's not in one of your fields, then you must harvest a field to make room for the new arrival. This usually isn't good! Next, you reveal two cards from the deck, and you can then trade these cards as well as any card in your hand for cards from other players. You can even make future promises for cards received right now! After all the trading is complete &mdash; and all trades on a turn must involve the active player &mdash; then you end your turn by drawing cards from the deck and placing them at the back of your hand.<br/><br/>When you harvest beans, you receive coins based on the number of bean cards in that field and the &quot;beanometer&quot; for that particular type of bean. Flip over 1-4 cards from that field to transform them into coins, then place the remainder of the cards in the discard pile. When the deck runs out, shuffle the discards, playing through the deck two more times. At the end of the game, everyone can harvest their fields, then whoever has earned the most coins wins.<br/><br/>Excalibohn plays much like Bohnanza except that most types of bean now have a special &quot;magic power&quot; associated with them. Each player starts the game with one magic card and can earn more. After planting one or two cards at the start of your turn, you now have a magic phase during which you can use potions and other special powers.<br/><br/>",

        "description": "On 15th November 1943, 100,000 Japanese of the IJA broke through the Chinese defense lines at Shek Mun, Cili and Lishui River. The 74th Division of the Chinese 57th Army (nicknamed as &quot;Growling Tiger Division&quot;) was ordered to defend Changde and fate will decide the outcome of the battle.<br/><br/>The Battle of Changde began on 18th November 1943 when the Imperial Japanese 11th Army under the command of Isamu Yokoyama already approached the strongholds in the suburbs of Changde with around 20,000 men under three divisions. The Japanese 116th Division in the northwest began to attack the Chinese defenders at Huangtu Mountain and the Hefu Mountain while the Japanese 68th Division in the east began to attack Shigongmiao and Xinmin Bridge (XinminQiao). The Japanese 3rd Division in the south advanced towards the southern bank of Yuan River after they took Deshan. On 25th November 1943 these three Japanese Divisions were outside Changde City.<br/><br/>The Chinese garrisons in the fortifications inside the city near the eastern, northern and western gates engaged the Japanese Forces continuously without any rest with the Japanese having firepower supremacy in both air force bombardments and artillery fires. On 28th November 1943, Japanese General Yokoyama launched simultaneous attacks on all the four gates. Despite the Chinese 57th Division fought valiantly, the city wall had fallen.<br/><br/>At the same time, reinforcements from the Chinese 19th Division were advancing towards Hefu and the 190th Division had begun to counterattack from the east. At this very moment, the overall commander of the defending garrison at Changde, Division Commander Yu Ching Man issued his last telegraph to Sun Lianzhong in this battle. &quot;No more ammunition, without reinforcement, the city has fallen.&quot;<br/><br/>Sun was the deputy commander of the Sixth Front On 1st December 1943, reinforcements from the Chinese 10th Army have captured positions at Deshan and the Chinese 3rd Division and the 10th Division were approaching from the southern bank to help the Changde garrison though they were unable to contact with the 57th Division, thereby failing to make concerted attack. On 3rd December 1943, the Chinese Regiment Commander Chai Yee Sun died gloriously while leading the last Chinese combat unit when covering the retreat of General Yu Ching Man and the remnants of the 57th division. On 6th December, the Japanese found themselves attacked by seven corps from the Chinese Sixth Front and the Ninth Front and the Japanese high command decided to withdraw to prevent the annihilation of the Japanese 11th Army.<br/><br/>On 7th December, General Yu Ching Man led the remnants of the 57th Division and coordinated with the 11th Division to attack Changde. On 9th Division, the Chinese entered the city through the Eastern gate and recovered Changde City. The Japanese withdrew back to the original frontline in early January 1944. In this battle, less than 300 of the original 8,000 defenders survived and the Japanese lost more than 4,000 soldiers in the sieget with total casualties of the campaign around 10,000. Chinese casualties were more than 100,000 but they held the City of Changde at a terrible price.<br/><br/>Scale<br/>1hex = 800m , unit = bataillon. Compared to the original game, we reworked the supply rules system and the management of the tactical chits and Air Force chits (and new graphics..)<br/><br/>Victory conditions<br/>The Japanese must control Changde at the end of the game. If at the end of any turn the Japanese control Changde, it's an automatic victory. If at any time during the game a Chinese reinforcement unit enters Changde, the Chinese wins the game. The Japanese will start strong but will have a lot to do to keep their supply roads safe. Supply is needed for heavy artillery and to reorganize and reconstruct infantry units. The Chinese reinforcement will enter the map in their rear from all sides. A double encirclement. It will be brutal.<br/><br/>Activation by divisions. Tactical chits and Air Force chits. Classical sequence of play and CRT. But as always with Wayne's games, there's more than that.<br/><br/>",

Players must cooperate to defeat the king, but only one of them can take the crown thus backstabbing is always a concern.  The game is played through various decks of cards.  Players strive to gain prestige and influence points so that they can recruit characters to their side.  They also use natural disasters, plagues, interrogations, and other political problems against their opponents. Of 19 possible actions each turn, a player can only perform 2, thus creating a tension and need for strategy. Player interaction is very high because players can perform actions during opponent turns and because nobody is eliminated early from the game. A player who is killed just misses a turn and then returns as the former player's heir, usually with revenge in mind.<br/><br/>",

        "description": "NXS (pronounced &quot;nexus&quot;) is an abstract strategy game played on hexagonal boards with hexagonal pieces.<br/><br/>Each player has his or her own board.  Each player sets up their pieces in either a short game (7 piece), medium (10 piece), or long game (13-14 piece) configuration.  Players push their boards together in either a two or three player arrangement.  Players alternately move their pieces (and rotate them) in an attempt to capture both enemy pieces, and enemy territory.  Enemy territory is captured by &quot;surrounding&quot; it.<br/><br/>Game play continues until one player captures a predetermined amount of enemy territory (usually 10 spaces).<br/><br/>Notes:<br/>Although there are official short, medium, and long game setups, players can choose any agreed upon starting position of pieces that they like.<br/><br/>The amount of territory required to win can be adjusted for different types of play.<br/><br/>When playing advanced rules, a player may rotate his or her entire game board as a move.<br/><br/>Although it is officially a 2-3 player game, 4 and 6 player games can also be played using an extra neutral board.<br/><br/>",

You use your cards to work in the collective farm shared by all, but you also have a private plot of land that no one else can touch. By harvesting crops from both fields (adding them together), you can win valuable production cards. You can score each crop only once during the game, so timing is important!<br/><br/>In more detail, each turn you must plant two domino-style land cards from your hand, then draw two cards from the deck to refill your hand. During your turn, you may also be able to harvest fields in order to take one production card. Plant the first card in front of you on your private plot so that it forms a grid of square fields. You can place it next to a previously placed card or cover one or two fields of any previously placed cards. However, your private plot can be a maximum of three fields in each direction (3x3). Plant the second card in the central collective farm, with exactly one field of this card covering a previously played field.<br/><br/>You may then harvest one of the crops on the card placed in the collective farm. To harvest a field, count the number of orthogonally connected fields of the same crop that are also connected with the crop you just planted.<br/><br/>When the deck is exhausted, play continues until all hand cards have been played. Alternatively, when a player takes their fifth production card &mdash; that is, has collect each type of crop once &mdash; the game ends at the end of the round. Each player then sums the points on the production cards in front of them, and the player with the most points wins!<br/><br/>",

The Dragon King is dead now and you, as one of his many overlooked offspring, have decided that it&rsquo;s time for a change.<br/><br/>Can you raise the funds to bribe the dragon clans to join your coup and the food to keep them? Can your strength convince the citizens of Lo&rsquo;en to support your claim to the throne? Can your followers influence the diverse Kingdoms&rsquo; many Guilds and Clan Houses, and use their powerful resources to aid your cause?<br/><br/>Your siblings have dynastic plans of their own and the dead King&rsquo;s influence, though weakening, must still be reckoned with. There will be many obstacles to surmount in your quest to claim the Dragon Throne.<br/><br/>Princes of the Dragon Throne is an area control and resource management board game that uses deck building as a driver for the other game elements. Players select cards from a continually changing pool of opportunities to build a unique deck of recruits. Players manage resources to support their uprising, and use the influence of their recruits to gain control of the various Guilds of the Kingdoms, which in turn gives them special abilities to further their cause.<br/><br/>Clever Mojo Games has contracted with Don Aguillo, an amazing talent with card game art experience, to create 120 new original artworks for Princes of the Dragon Throne and our card design format will highlight Don&rsquo;s art in a bold and beautiful manner.<br/><br/>",

Your mission: restore humanity.<br/><br/>Game System: The Midnight Legion is a highly advanced game book series in the style of the classic Choose Your Own Adventure series, but with MUCH more (think more like an advanced version of SORCERY or LONE WOLF with deeper character generation). The gameplay system allows solo play, or optionally a second player can act as the game master. There are combat, puzzles, diplomacy, stealth and role playing elements. Collect information, knowledge and goods from the world around you to advance your character.<br/><br/>Story: You are forced awake in an underground facility after hundreds of years of stasis. All you know is that you are an agent of an ancient, clandestine group, and you have a mission &ndash; but your memory is gone, and you don&rsquo;t recall what that mission is.<br/><br/>Game Play: You must choose whether to complete your objectives using combat, stealth or sixth sense and diplomacy. You can solve the puzzles that unlock the base&rsquo;s secrets using logic, or you can try to recover your lost memories for clues.<br/><br/>",

Regions on the map consist of multiple movement areas, with terrain-dependent movement cost to enter an area.<br/><br/>Counters are multiples of strength points, each strength point being equal to 500 men. No combat distinction between infantry and cavalry or between militia and regulars.  Colonial militia appears at full force in a region whenever a British force enters it but can never leave the region. Tory militia appears once per region the first time British regulars enter, and they can be converted to regulars and leave the region, but will never reappear in that region once they've left.<br/><br/>The British player wins by controlling regions whose victory point total exceeds the scenario requirement.  Colonials win by winning three major battles, by winning two major battles while limiting the British player to less than half of the scenario victory point total, or by lasting to the end of 1783 without the British player winning.<br/><br/>Multiple &quot;what-if&quot; situations are provided, with each one adjusting the British victory point level required to win.  Many of these can be used in combination, resulting in moderate replay value.<br/><br/>",

Players decide which cards to hold and which to exchange in an attempt to improve their word, their poker hand, and hopefully both.<br/><br/>Like traditional poker, players can enjoy a variety of games like the favorites 'Texas Hold'em' and 'Five Card Draw', or original games like 'Unlucky 7's' and 'Wild I's'.<br/><br/>Unlike traditional poker, Parlay involves no betting or wagering. However, players are faced with an element of poker-style risk, where every hand they must decide whether to 'FOLD' for guaranteed points, or risk their points and 'STAY' in an attempt to win out over opponents for big point bonuses.<br/><br/>Parlay also introduces 'Wordbluffing', where players are invited to play oddly spelled words to trick their opponents into calling their bluff to knock them out of the hand. Players can also try to get away with fake or misspelled words, hoping their bluff won't be called. Wordbluffing usually results in lots of laughs.<br/><br/>Parlay comes with a deck of 52 casino quality playing cards, 2 jokers, 1 info card, 6 stay/fold game chips, 80 sheet score pad, and an instruction booklet.

In wargame parlance, it is &quot;grand-tactical&quot; in scope, in that players command entire armies, moving whole corps and divisions on the table. The basic unit on the table-top is the brigade, representing a few thousand soldiers. At this scale, of course, many things are abstracted. We do not concern ourselves with the actions of small groups of soldiers. Rather, we place ourselves in the roles of generals, ordering thousands of men to move, attack, or defend. And, like those generals of history, we don't know whether or not our officers and men are going to behave exactly as we hope or expect.<br/><br/>",

Each player plays their own deck of cards with the Union objective of capturing three key victory cities (Richmond, Atlanta, Vicksburg) and the Confederates trying to prevent this.<br/><br/>Resource Events, Battle Events, Special Events, and Strategic Movement Events determine the course of the game.  Cards have multiple choices on them from which one event type is selected.  Sequence of plays allows for movement to a battlefield, turning movements, retreats, and shifting initiatives.  This will determine if, or how a battle is fought.<br/><br/>There is a stylized sort of tactical flavor for individual battles, while maintaining touch with strategic and political issues of the time.<br/><br/>There are 300 cards comprising Union, Confederate, and Battle decks.<br/><br/>",

Fuelled by hate and fear, Winter aims at extinguishing the flame of Love and the light of Hope under a blanket of snow and the never-ending chill of a winter night. In the winding alleys and the small houses desperately clinging to the hillside of Wintertown, frightened Tales move in the shadows, knowing they cannot allow all Hope for the future to be snuffed out by the cold and ready to fight to drive Winter away and let Spring come again.<br/><br/>In Winter Tales, a storytelling board game, players tell the tale of the conflict between the characters of fairy tales, who represent all that is good and hopeful, and the Soldiers of Winter, who incarnate evil and the fierce cold of Winter. Players will ally themselves with one of the warring Factions, controlling characters and fighting for the comeback of Spring or the suffocation of all hope, bringing on an endless Winter.<br/><br/>Winter Tales is an ever-changing game as each time the players will tell a completely different story, creating a shared plot.<br/><br/>",

Eight weather cards are shuffled into a small deck, then players are dealt a hand of six cards from a deck that contains cards labeled A, B, C, D, Delay, and Lucky Captain. A runway with sections A, B and C lies in front of all players.<br/><br/>On a turn, a player either discards 1-3 cards or takes an action. An action can be either playing a Delay card on an opponent's plane (which moves that plane back one space on the runway unless the opponent discards a Lucky Captain card) or playing a set of 1-3 cards of the same letter to advance one of the player's planes. If you play a single A, for example, you can place your small plane on the A section of the runway; if you play three As, you can place your large plane on the A. If you play three Cs, you can advance your large plane from B to C.<br/><br/>To take off, you must play 1-3 D cards (depending on the size of the plane), then reveal the top weather card, which might show that one size of plane can't take off. If this size matches the plane trying to go airborne, then you discard the cards to no effect; otherwise, the plane leaves the runway and heads into the sky (a.k.a. the game box). A Lucky Captain card can represent any letter card when played.<br/><br/>At the end of your turn, refill your hand to six cards. The first player to get all three of their planes airborne wins!<br/><br/>",

If you're the first to reach Level 10, you win! However, watch out for conniving villains such as Bigtime Beagle or Curses that could distract you from becoming filthy rich.<br/><br/>The treasure hunt begins as soon as the first player &quot;Kicks Open a Door&quot; to reveal what's hidden on the other side. If a villain is nowhere to be found, you'll be free to use your Class skills to &quot;Loot the Room&quot; for hidden items and treasures. Will you uncover the Crown of Genghis Khan or Magica's Magic Mirror to aid you on your quest? If you're not so lucky, you'll be greeted by that stingy Flintheart Glomgold, the wicked Magica DeSpell, and other bad guys that must be defeated using card bonuses, powerful Treasure items, Ally cards such as Bubba the Caveduck and Donald Duck, or even teaming up with other players! Choose your friends wisely!<br/><br/>When you're feeling as mischievous as Huey, Dewy, and Louie, you may also decide to &quot;Look for Trouble&quot; and fight a monster already in your hand. Use your best judgment to decide if combat will increase your chances of winning, or send you into a tail spin.<br/><br/>",

        "description": "&quot;Iliad: The Siege of Troy&quot; is a wargame of single combat...between the Gods and Heroes of ancient Greece and Troy.  To the mundane scholars of academe, the Trojan War was fought for control of the ancient Black Sea trade routes.  To the Romantic, it was fought over Helen of Troy, 'the face that launched a thousand ships and burned the topless towers of Ilium.' Whatever the cause, romantic or commercial, the war raged ten long years and involved the greatest warriors of that ancient age.  Behind them stood the Olympian gods who, although forbidden by Zeus from intervening decisively, nevertheless gave what help they could to the side they favored.  The Iliad is a fast-moving game of the entire ten-year war which has formed the basis for Homer's epic Iliad.  Features include:<br/><br/><br/>     Every important Greek and Trojan hero is individually represented<br/>     Heroes face each other in single combat as they vie for superiority<br/>     Olympian gods may receive appeals and aid their chosen heroes<br/>     Special rules cover the quarrel between Agamemnon and Achilles: if the quarrel is set aside, Achilles joins the battle, much to the dismay of the Trojans.<br/><br/><br/>Outside references:<br/><br/>&quot;Players Notes&quot; by S.

Players experience the realities and excitement of the Desert War without the boredom.<br/><br/>A turn may last a few minutes or much longer, depending on how hard players are willing to push their forces. Like the war itself, periods of relative quiet explode into furious, quick-playing manuever and combat.<br/><br/>Three scenarios and the Campaign game:<br/>- Rommel's First Offensive: depicts the first dramatic sweep against Eighth Army.<br/>- Operation Crusader: picks up with the first successful British counter offensive.<br/>- Gazala: a revitalized Afrika Korps is faced by an entrenched Eighth Army.<br/>- The War in the Desert: the entire 20-month War, from April '41 to November '42.<br/><br/>",

After a thousand years of war, Countermay is dying. Battles, curses, extraterrestrial parasites, demonic influence, and other hazards have ruined much of the planet. The food is running out, and the threat of starvation looms. The only way to save Countermay is to seize undisputed control. Until then, armies march, fed with the ever-dwindling food as they churn farmland into mud with their boots. Can you save Countermay from its invitable doom?<br/><br/>Romance of the Nine Empires is a fictitious interactive collectible card game (CCG) set in the fantasy world of Countermay. In the game, players assume command of one of nine vastly different warring factions &mdash; including steampunk aliens, a dark god-king's crusade of conversion, displaced WWII-era American GIs, and a risen empire of the undead &mdash; to expand, glorify, or defend their empires. Through its fictitious fifteen-year history, players have shaped the world of Countermay through their individual and collective achievements, and the results are reflected in the story and the current state of the empires. That concept was inspired by the Legend of the Burning Sands CCG, which in turn is based on the Legend of the Five Rings CCG: in those real-life games, tournament results affect the actual story in future expansions.<br/><br/>The plot of the 2013 movie The Gamers: Hands of Fate revolves around the fictitious game.  Within the movie itself, AEG was the publisher of the game, but as a result of Kickstarter funding for The Gamers: Hands of Fate, it decided to create a real-life version of R9E.  The real-life release is not a collectable game, but a boxed set with a set distribution of cards. This boxed set represents the fictitious 15th Anniversary World Championship Edition of Romance of the Nine Empires, and (to slip into the movie storyline for a second) it holds the decks used by the top-placing characters for each faction that made it to the quarterfinals at the 2012 World Championships at Gen Con Indy.<br/><br/>So there's 3 levels of reality at play here:<br/><br/><br/>     the CCG game called Romance of the Nine Empires, pictured in the movie The Gamers: Hands of Fate, which is played by the characters at Gen Con Indy 2012 and is 15 years old;<br/>     the fantasy world of Countermay, which is pictured in the CCG game and whose history is shaped by the players of the CCG game;<br/>     the real card game Romance of the Nine Empires, edited by AEG in 2013, which comes in a boxed set and is inspired by (and presented as) the fictitious CCG.<br/><br/><br/>",

On the other hand, great portion of the bad luck is mitigated by smart use of cards and player interaction.<br/><br/>* The game features several scenarios that adjust the rules and differ in the amount of cooperation between the players from pure co-op to more individual playstyle to a competitive race mode.

Players assume the roles of the few remaining on-board crew members of the U.S.S. Enterprise, which is docked for repairs.<br/><br/>The players (watching the tape) see a renegade Klingon (named KAVOK) hijack the ship with only themselves aboard with him. He periodically appears on the television screen (which is a simulation of different communication view screens aboard the ship) and talks to the players during the game.<br/><br/>KAVOK's intention is to use the Federation ship to to attack the Klingon Empire and instigate a Federation/Klingon war. He also plans to gloriously die in battle along with the remaining crew. KAVOK will create setbacks and obstacles for the players as they attempt to gain access to the bridge and regain control of the ship. The journey to the Klingon Empire takes 60 minutes of real time game-playing (displayed on screen). They play against the clock, and if nobody wins, they all lose.<br/><br/>Play consists of rolling the die, moving around the board (which represents the Enterprise), drawing cards and interacting with the video of KAVOK until they reach the bridge and win, or the time expires and they lose.<br/><br/>A sequel involving Q was planned for release the following year but was shelved due to licensing issues.<br/><br/>",

You are one of the Wizards of Pizza trainees who aspire to become the Pizza Master. Your job is to buy ingredients, collect the ones you want, and make pizzas to earn reputation points.<br/><br/>What makes these seemingly simple tasks challenging is that ingredients might run out as trainees all share the same refrigerator.

A round consists of 6 phases.<br/><br/>(1) Start the day - Each trainee draws 4 pizza menu cards.<br/><br/>(2) Shopping - In turn order, each trainee takes 4 coins and must spend them to buy ingredients (cheese, vegetable, seafood and meat). After all trainees finish shopping, all ingredients go to the shared refrigerator (the centre of the board).<br/><br/>(3) Collecting - In reverse turn order, each trainee takes turns collecting one ingredient token from the board to their own cooking tray. Once you pass, you cannot take any more ingredient token for this round.<br/><br/>BE CAREFUL IT'S SHARED REFRIGERATOR THAT OTHER TRAINEES CAN PICK YOURS<br/><br/>(4) Making Pizzas - Trainees make as many pizzas as they can by spending ingredient tokens that are required on pizza menu cards.<br/><br/>(5) Scoring - Trainees are rewarded reputation points for completed pizza menu cards. The total is then subtracted by the number of unused ingredient tokens on the cooking tray.<br/><br/>(6) End of the day - Trainees discard all ingredient tokens. The turn order is then re-determined by reputation points.<br/><br/>Special rules :<br/><br/>1.Beginner mode : no special rule.<br/>2.Trainee mode : Objective Cards, reserving and exchanging ingredient mechanics.<br/>3.Master mode : Trainee Mode + Daily Missions, and all trainees SHARE Pizza Menu Cards!<br/><br/>",

If you play a card of the next season, the season changes!<br/><br/>A change in season often alters who wins that trick, as the highest rank card of the season that the trick ends in, wins that trick. These potential mid-trick season changes means that standard trick-taking maneuvers, such as drawing out trump, often won't work.<br/><br/>Players score points either by taking the 6 Holly and Oak kings, worth 1 or 2 points each, or by taking no tricks at all, worth 8, 5, or 3 points in 3, 4, and 5 player games respectively.<br/><br/>Between no-trick scoring and mid-trick trump changes, Holly Oak becomes a game of manipulating both the lead and current season to your advantage.

One player commands the French forces, the other the Austrians. The map is an accurate representation of the battlefield, the counters represent the forces which took part, and rules on movement, combat, leadership and morale reflect the problems and possibilities which faced the historical commanders.<br/><br/>The scale of the combat is that one strength point represent 200 infantry, 150 cavalry or 2 guns, each turn is 35 minutes; each hex is 600 yards. Victory is determined my control of objective hexes and loss inflicted on the enemy.<br/><br/>Note:<br/>Eckmuhl is a complete game in itself. It can also be played as a &ldquo;campaign game&rdquo; linked with another of 3W&rsquo;s Bonaparte series, The Battle of Abensberg (in S&amp;T #113). Eckmuhl was fought on the two days following Abensberg, in the area immediately to the north. Many of the same units participated, along with many others. Two scenarios were provided with Abensberg; four are provided with Eckmuhl. A further dozen scenarios will be found in The Wargamer #3 and S&amp;T #115 (Kanev). These later scenarios link the two games.<br/><br/>Strategy &amp; Tactics magazine #116 adds two more scenarios and a Q&amp;A by the designer.<br/><br/>",

Each faction has its own strengths and unique talents. In addition each game is played with randomized factions, which leads to many different combinations of play-styles.

Build a team, craft the perfect strategy deck, and choose a home stadium.<br/><br/>The quest for the perfect deck starts here. Create a team based on a set salary cap, choose strategy cards that will solidify their strengths, and select the stadium that will give you an unbeatable home field advantage.<br/><br/>Every at bat includes two basic elements&ndash;the Pitch &amp;  Swing. To keep it simple: the Pitch determines who will get the advantage in the at bat, and the Swing determines the result of the at bat.<br/><br/>The game is played and scored just like traditional baseball using player cards that are Batters and Pitchers from real big league teams with suitable stats on a playmat resembling a baseball field. Play a full game (9 innings) consisting of  3  outs  per  &frac12;  inning,  with  the  Away  Manager  batting  in  the  top  half  of  the  inning. As you send each batter card up to the plate, there is a pitch roll and a swing roll to determine the result (out, walk, hit, home run, etc).<br/><br/>Batter cards move around the bases to score runs like in real baseball. The game ends after 9 innings with the team that scored more runs being the winner - in the event of a tie you go to extra innings until one team comes out ahead!<br/><br/>Strategy cards played at different times give bonuses or allow you to make real baseball plays like hit-and-run, defensive shifts or even a suicide squeeze. You can use pinch hitters and runners, make pitching changes and other real baseball decisions.<br/><br/>",

An evil as old as time has awoken and it is possessing you all by taking advance of your weakness. If nobody finds the book of the dead and destroys it, this will be your last night as humans.<br/><br/>The Possession is a game for 3 to 5 players in which time is against them. The evil is stalking you and each round the players could be possessed by it, and becoming one of the thirsty blood demons looking for living souls, the other players' souls!<br/><br/>At the beginning of a round, all players roll a die: the more wounds you have, the more easily you become a possessed. Then players play an action card to indicate how many actions they can play and how much they risk suffering an evil event. This risk is higher in the cards that give more actions.<br/><br/>When a player finds enough pages from the book of the dead and burns them in an altar, before the evil owns all players, he becomes the winner. By using the action points, players can cover the house looking for the pages as well as objects, weapons, and keys to get into the basement and attic-; they can also rest in order to get back the action cards played and heal wounds to keep alive.<br/><br/>A possessed player must attack his friends so that the evil inside him feeds of his crime and not with his soul. He will be able to smash doors, escape for windows to get inside in other rooms and so, surprise another players. He will have more action points depending on his possessing level.<br/><br/>The other players can attack the possessed ones. The only way to stop them is dismembering them completely &mdash; but these amputated members will be wandering around ready to claw and strangle whoever gets close enough...<br/><br/>",

        "description": "Platoon is a simple wargame on small squad combat in Vietnam.  The game is similar to AH's Smithsonian series games:  a single sheet with basic rules and a small booklet that contains advanced rules, additional scenarios and historical background information.  The combat system is also similar to other Smithsonian games.<br/><br/>The scenarios and soldiers are based upon events and characters in the movie.<br/><br/>The game uses two elements to create fog of war:<br/>-  the counters have small stands so the identity of each counter is unknown to the enemy.  Some of the counters are fakes and &quot;substitutes&quot; (these are used to combine several counters into a single group.  All counters are placed in an off board box and the matching substitute counter is placed on the map.)<br/>-  Random initiative draw.  Similar to Firepower, chits for each side are placed in a cup and each turn one is randomly drawn to determine which player may move.<br/><br/>Platoon had a AH complexity rating of 3.<br/><br/>",

There was a magic school dropout trying to pass as a wizard, a deranged oracle claiming a 33% chance of guessing the future correctly, a beastmaster accompanied by the odor of all his beasts, a claustrophobic minotaur and a venomant addicted to his own potions. He sighed. Are these wrecks able to rescue the prince? Probably not, but is there anyone else willing to take the job?<br/><br/>Quest Stories is a narrative game for 3-5 players set in a humorous fantasy world. Each round, one player assumes the role of the bartender, who is looking for the best heroes to accomplish a quest. The rest of the players are hero recruiters who will try to convince the bartender that their hired team is the most suitable to get that job done, while they try to highlight the shortcomings of their contenders.<br/><br/>From the publisher (translated):<br/>El tabernero limpiaba cuidadosamente las jarras de cerveza mientras miraba con escepticismo al grupo de aventureros que, con pose heroica, se presentaba ante &eacute;l: un hechicero que hab&iacute;a sido expulsado de la escuela de magia, una or&aacute;culo que dec&iacute;a conocer el futuro con un 33% de probabilidades de acertar, una domadora de bestias que apestaba, un minotauro con claustrofobia y un alquimista adicto a sus propias pociones.

        "description": "The First World War is coming to an end. It had a devastating impact on Habsburg Austria-Hungary, the Kingdom of Prussia, and the Russian Empire, which over 120 years earlier partitioned and wiped the Polish&ndash;Lithuanian Commonwealth from the maps. But this global conflict that exhausted the partitioners of Poland gives the opportunity to restore Poland and regain independence. Now, go back to the time of the First World War and join the key statesmen of the era. Responsibility for the existence and the future shape of Poland lies on your shoulders. Only through cooperation may you revive your homeland and protect it from its enemies. Are you brave enough to undertake the mission?<br/><br/>Niepodległa, which is Polish for &quot;independent&quot;, is a board game published by Poland's Institute of National Remembrance to celebrate the 100th anniversary of the rebirth of Poland. The game illustrates the events that led to the restoration of Poland's sovereignty. This co-operative game played with dice and cards is for 2&ndash;4 players aged 12 or over and has two variants: basic, mostly aimed at education (30 minutes) and advanced for intermediate or experienced players (90 minutes).<br/><br/>The scope of the gameplay are the events of the years 1910&ndash;1920 with an emphasis on the period between the outbreak of the First World War and the restoration of Poland's sovereignty in 1918. The board represents the former and &mdash; eventually &mdash; future territory of Poland. The players immerse themselves in the operations undertaken by the key characters of the battle for the independence; they try to spread the ideas of independence, seek a national consensus, and strengthen Poland's position in the world. If they fulfill certain conditions, Poland will regain sovereignty in the grand finale in 1918.<br/><br/>However, despite regaining independence, if the players fail to meet decisive challenges &mdash; the Peace Conference in Paris, the development of a new state administration, the struggle over Poland's borders as well as the uprisings in Greater Poland and Silesia and the Poland-Bolshevik war &mdash; Poland may well cease to exist.<br/><br/>Niepodległa has 50 wooden pieces (including 19 special dice), 110 beautifully illustrated large playing cards and 24 smaller ones, as well as 88 cardboard pieces, 2 instruction leaflets (for both variants) and a richly illustrated booklet with a historical essay.<br/><br/>&mdash;description from the publisher<br/><br/>",

Designed for seven to seventeen players, in Mafia: Vendetta some players take on the roles of Mafia members, others become the civilians of a crime-filled community. Every night the Mafia kills another person, every day the civilians have a chance to discuss the murder, choose suspects, and condemn one of them to death. Since every role is secret, you never know who is an innocent bystander, and who is part of the Mafia. If the Mafia kill off enough civilians, the community becomes a permanent haven for crime, but if the civilians rid their community of the Mafia, they win.<br/><br/>Mafia: Vendetta offers eleven different civilian roles and five different Mafia roles. It also features two different alternative modes, the Loner mode and Yakuza mode, that each introduce a third faction to the game. You might play a Mafia Thug, a protective Nurse, an innocent Bystander, or a cunning Imposter. No matter what your role, play it convincingly, make your choices carefully, and trust no one.<br/><br/>",

        "description": "&quot;Altar of Freedom: Grand Tactical Battles in the American Civil War&quot; is a set of miniatures wargame rules for fighting the largest battles of the American Civil War in 6mm scale.<br/><br/>This system is designed for real historical scenarios like Antietam or Chickamauga, not for points-driven tournament matches. Your role as a player will be to step into the boots of a corps or army general. Operating at the highest levels of command, you will not bother yourself with micromanaging regiments or interfering in the affairs of your colonels. Your challenge will be coordinating your divisions to be in the right place at the right time and wrestling with the out-sized personalities of your corps commanders. The rest, as Robert E. Lee might say, is in God's hands.<br/><br/>Grand Tactical: The rules are designed for 6mm/10mm miniatures, with an available conversion to 15mm. One turn is approximately one hour,  1&quot; = 150+ yards, and 1 base = 1 brigade. Basing is flexible, so long as both armies are based in the same manner.<br/><br/>Altar of Freedom is a turn-based game, although the duration of each turn is determined by a variable Turn Clock. At the start of each turn, players secretly bid Priority Points for the opportunity to maneuver their divisions before the enemy. After the secret bidding, players reveal their highest bids and begin maneuvering divisions in order of priority. After each new bid is reached, players roll to remove time from the Turn Clock. The Turn Clock is the strategic center-piece of the game, since players vie for control of the clock throughout the battle. He who controls the clock can manipulate the speed of the countdown. When the clock does expire, the turn ends immediately and players complete some minor adjustments before proceeding to the next turn. Because all games are based on historical scenarios, every battle has a defined end with victory conditions for each commander.<br/><br/>",

If anything falls off the plate and stains the table, the player's turn ends immediately. A player can use only one hand and can touch only one noodle at a time at one point. If pulling a noodle causes a meatball to start rolling off the plate, the player can drop the noodle to try to catch the meatball. At the moment the meatball is grabbed, it cannot be touching any noodles on the plate. These skillfully caught meatballs are worth one point at the end of the game.<br/><br/>The game ends when the plate is empty, with no pasta and no meatballs, and whoever scores the most points wins.<br/><br/>There are two additional difficulty levels: Spaghetti Difficili and Spaghetti Superiori.<br/><br/><br/>    Spaghetti Difficili differs from the basic game in the number of meatballs (now four) and the size of plate on which spaghetti is served (players choose a small one).<br/><br/><br/><br/>    In Spaghetti Superiori, players earn extra points for fulfilling Italian recipes. There are 12 recipe tokens in total, each shows spaghetti ingredients. Players must remove those ingredients to claim the token.

        "description": "The third game in the Shields &amp; Swords II series tackles two unusual engagements. In both battles, the &quot;invincible&quot; Livonian Order - an autonomous branch of the Teutonic Knights - met their enemies atop a frozen body of water, and in both cases, they suffered a humiliating defeat.<br/><br/>The 1242 battle at Lake Peipus was immortalized in Sergei Eisenstein's rousing film &quot;Alexander Nevsky&quot;, and is probably the first thing most folks think of when they hear &quot;Battle on the Ice&quot;. This battle should have been a cakewalk for the Livonians, as their elite, well-armed, ruthless cavalry were facing a feudal army of peasants. But Nevsky exhibited sound tactical judgment, and a deployment of his own cavalry at just the right time turned the tide decisively in his favor. Similar to THE GRUNWALD SWORDS or S&amp;S I game OUR ROYAL BONES, this battle allows the Novgorod Player to choose the exact moment to bring in his horse archers (making their first appearance in the S&amp;S II series). The longer he waits, the more VP he'll score, but the greater the chance that it'll be too late.<br/><br/>The 1270 Battle of Karuse, fought on the frozen Baltic Sea, is a bit more obscure, but quite possibly more interesting. This time around it's the Livonians and their allies against a Lithuanian Army under Grand Duke Traidenis. The Lithuanians use sleds as a defensive barrier, and use hit-and-run tactics to unhorse the bold brothers. Special rules for unhorsing, dismounting, and charging the sleds give this one a lot of nuance.<br/><br/>Both battles see a force that's strong in cavalry brought low by a force that's predominantly fighting on foot. Semi-random force pools utilized in each battle provide additional replayability. As always, the core S&amp;S II system - easy to learn, teach, and play - allows for a fun, fast, streamlined medieval experience.<br/><br/>&mdash;description from the publisher<br/><br/>",

The objective of this unprecedented military maneuver is to send quickly a reinforcement of 4000 men of an infantry brigade. As a lieutenant in charge of logistics, you cooperate to embark soldiers and organize convoys. You have a great responsibility: face the challenge without giving up to the pressure of taxis that accumulate!<br/><br/>&quot;The taxis of the Marne&quot; is cooperative card game. On a player turn, a new taxi arrives at the Invalides square and then the players plays 3 actions out of the 4 possible actions:<br/><br/>     Mobilize soldiers (drawing a solder card)<br/>     Move an officer<br/>     Exchange (swap a card with an another player, or with the deck on solo mode)<br/>     Load and send a taxi<br/><br/><br/>The game ends when all taxis have been sent or when the Invalides square is completely surrounded by unsent taxis.<br/><br/>",

The new additions include a new character as well as a point system to replace the all-or-nothing nature of accusations.  The basic idea is to pretend to be somebody you are not while working towards the goal of figuring out who other people are. Each player is assigned one of seven different characters -- each with its own unique abilities -- but can pretend to be any character and use its corresponding powers. Abilities are used to acquire three different types of goods, which can be spent to get clues to opponents' identities. If the majority of the other players think you're pretending to be a character that you're not, you must either admit that you are not that character (and permanently lose the use of its power), or reveal that you are and win the game.<br/><br/>Is a re-implementation of:<br/><br/>    Hoax<br/><br/><br/>",

Someone shuffles the deck, then each player receives ten cards face down, which they place in a row in front of them. Playing simultaneously and as quickly as possible, players reveal these cards (without rearranging them), then start taking cards one at a time from those scattered in the center of the table and placing them on one of the ten cards in front of them, thereby creating stacks of cards as the game progresses. If a player draws a thunderstorm card, she can place it on any stack.<br/><br/>As soon as a player has ten number cards in ascending order from left to right, she yells &quot;Stop!&quot; and ends the round. If she's correct, she scores 10 points, plus 2 points for ending the round. Each other player scores points for the number of cards in order starting from their left stack. In addition, each card with a lightning bolt (whether in order or not) is worth 1 point, while each thunderstorm card is worth -1 point. Players then shuffle the cards and start another round. Whoever reaches 50 or more points first wins!<br/><br/>Flash 10 includes two variants. In one, players can end the round even if they have one or more thunderstorm cards in their row. In the second, players use nine cards instead of ten, and they must arrange their cards in ascending, then descending order with the fifth card in the row serving as the turning point.<br/><br/>",

It is a different, dynamic game designed to be able to build different decks with very distinct and varied strategies, and each installment increases both the number of available mythologies and the game possibilities.<br/><br/>The game contains 150 cards split between the Great Old Ones and reinforcements for GDM I, GDM II and GDM III. Great Old Ones includes 2 pantheons (cards that define your game strategy) + 33 cards for the gods deck (which includes characters, events and resources) + 40 cards for the designs deck (actions, equipment and summonings)and reinforcements to 150 new cards for GDM.<br/><br/>Each player in War of the Myths IV needs to build his own deck of at least 51 cards (1 pantheon / 20 gods / 30 designs) of his choice, and each installment increases the diversity of characters, actions and strategies you can use in order to achieve victory.<br/><br/>Each player has to bring into play the cards his oracles offer him and play actions from the designs deck both in the influence phase (where the gods plan from their pantheon) and in the confrontation phase (where the characters who decide to go to battle fight to decrease the opponent&rsquo;s power) to obtain supremacy or consign the opponent to oblivion.<br/><br/>",

For example: &quot;I have taken a test drive before I was even allowed to drive!&quot;<br/><br/>Each player answers honestly, but secretly, by placing a YES or NO answer card face down in the middle of the table. Each player must now guess how many players have answered YES. Jot each player's guess on the scoresheet in the proper column. Shuffle the answer cards briefly, then reveal them. Anyone who guessed exactly right gets three points; anyone who was off by one gets one point. Record the points on the scoresheet in each player's left column. The game ends after 15 rounds, and whoever was best able to assess their fellow players, and thus earn the most points, wins.<br/><br/>Privacy Quickie includes three hundred questions and can be played as a standalone game or used as an expansion for Privacy, Privacy 2, or Privacy: Scharf wie Chili.<br/><br/>",

        "description": "A fantasy Miniatures game based on Legend of the Five Rings, which combines a use of a card deck with a d10 based rolling system.  It is based on a fantasy setting heavily influenced by feudal Japan with Samurai of various clans fighting to support their lord's quest to become Emperor. There are also shugenja (mages), Dragons, Naga, and hordes of evil demons (Oni). You get a certain number of points to build an army, and armies must typically have units that are either from the same clan or unaligned. You can be units from other clans, but they cost a premium (usually 20% above list price).  Typically, personalities lead units, which is some number of basic troops (usually samurai). A good personality can cost as much as 30 or 40 basic troops, but most cost around 10 times more. Leaders, and occasionally units, have skills. Skills are used to modify initiatives, absorb damage, boost morale, and the like. Many personalities (and some units) also have skills that are unique to that personality / unit.<br/><br/>In addition to the units, each player also has a customized deck of thirty cards. These cards let the player make special moves, pass morale tests, and do other acts of courage. Each player builds their own deck (just like in a collectable card game) and typically draws a card a turn, although one player gets to draw two. Since a game lasts about 6-10 turns, a player should expect to see 1/3 rd to 1/2 of their deck (you start with three cards) in a battle.<br/><br/>After setting up, a turn looks like the following:<br/><br/><br/>     Determine Initiatives,<br/>     Do Special Action/Orders,<br/>     Move,<br/>     Cavalry Move Again,<br/>     Shoot,<br/>     Fight,<br/>     Reserve Movement.<br/><br/><br/>(Detail from the review by Bankler: <a target='_blank' href=\"http://www.boardgamegeek.com/thread/68739/clan-war-review\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer noopener\">http://www.boardgamegeek.com/thread/68739/clan-war-review</a>)<br/><br/>",

You take the role of one of the pioneering factions, set out  to explore  a yet uncharted galaxy discovered through a wormhole.<br/>​<br/>You and your rivals explore a number of sectors in this new galaxy, which is represented by the Space Deck. The Space Deck contains new systems that you can colonize, anomalies that can be researched for renown, and galactic events that can affect your colonies in various ways.<br/><br/>You start off already with a foothold, a habitable planet in the Core Sector. From here you have to make some hard choices which way you develop. Do you build mining colonies on systems with deposits, and use these riches to build high value colonies? Or will you invest in science, researching the weird and wonderful treasures of this new galaxy to earn renown? You can choose to cut corners and use more nefarious means to build your colonies, or focus on space ships that don't require a system for support that can aid your economy.<br/><br/>Whatever path you choose, as a pioneer you can only hold onto 4 systems at a time, and in order to keep claiming worlds that earn you renown you must relinquish control of systems to your faction at a certain point. This requires you to plan ahead in order to not inadvertedly breakdown your economy. <br/>​<br/>When all the sectors have been explored, each player tallies up their renown earned from systems claimed, high value colonies built, anomalies researched and events dealt with. Whomever has the highest score will be the winner and will Take the Galaxy!<br/><br/>",

Not only do you have to run and escape, you have to live.<br/><br/>You have a limited amount of dice each round to fight your way through while you and the other players can change the forest as you make your mad dash to safety.<br/><br/>Beware the squirrel! He wants your brains, not your nuts!<br/><br/><br/>Game Play:<br/>You move across a game play area covered in hidden threats that want to eat you (cards) and you have to fight them with a limited and diminishing dice pool.<br/><br/>You move and challenge a card to progress from the camp to the road.  When you challenge the card in front of you is revealed.  You have to then battle that card to move forward.  You have to decide how many of your attack dice to use.  You also have to decide what (if any) item cards in your stash you want to use to help you.  You can only use each dice once per turn so be careful.<br/><br/>Be the first to escape the Nightmare Forest at a Dead Run and be victorious.

Hailed by many as of the premier entry in the popular Series: Battles for North Africa (3W) series, this two-player operational level simulation covers the WWII German and Italian offensive in central Tunisia which took place in mid-February 1943.<br/><br/>This edition of Decision at Kasserine features a super-sized map and counters and is another Classic Reborn! by Compass.<br/><br/>On the morning of February 19, the Germans launched their attack through the Kasserine Pass. Heavy damage was inflicted on the Allied forces, causing the Allies to retreat 50 miles. Despite these losses and setbacks, Allied forces and reserves managed to regroup and hold on February 22, launching a massive artillery attack to halt the German advances. Faced with his own overextended supply lines and an Allied force that was now being reinforced, Rommel withdrew and ordered all Axis units to concentrate on defending the German-held coastal areas. Had the German-Italian army succeeded, the war in North Africa would have been lengthened, thus possibly delaying the Allied invasion of Europe.This offensive was the last major Axis effort which offered a realistic chance to reverse their fortunes in North Africa.<br/><br/>This Designer Signature edition of the classic Vance von Borries game goes beyond a mere culmination of the forward strides made with subsequent games published in the series; it now features a major update to the game system that will be implemented in future game releases of the popular Series: Battles for North Africa (3W) series. In terms of superior physical presentation, all aspects have been upgraded, including super-sized components; larger game map and 5/8&quot; counters. Some of the enhancements made in this edition include:<br/><br/>&bull; Super-sized components feature 5/8&rdquo; counters and two game maps with large hexes<br/>&bull; Game map information is updated and includes all-new map artwork<br/>&bull; Supporting charts convey more information at a glance for ease of play<br/>&bull; Enhanced ergonomics are built into the set up and reinforcement charts<br/>&bull; Updated the Order of Battle based on new information and analysis<br/>&bull; Fixed the original deployment and OoB based on archival information<br/>&bull; The rules treatment is all-new with a full re-write backed by many illustrations, an index, and clarifications and examples of play to reduce potential questions. Some rules were simplified, others enhanced.<br/>&bull; Redesigned treatment on air units, armor bonus, and strongpoints in combat and a clarified treatment on the artillery rules<br/>&bull; New rules cover infiltration movement, combat evasion and retreat options<br/>&bull; New optional rules cover mountain units, certain reinforcements, Allied artillery concentrations, and considerable Allied command problems<br/>&bull; Many all-new historical notes can be found throughout the rules presentation<br/>&bull; Three new scenarios have been added<br/><br/>Product Information:<br/><br/>Complexity: 6 out of 10<br/>Solitaire Suitability: 6 out of 10 (no hidden units; variable German victory conditions)<br/>Time Scale: 12 hours per turn<br/>Map Scale: two miles per hex<br/>Unit Scale: companies and battalions, artillery batteries or groups<br/>Players: one to two, best with two<br/>Playing Time: 3-8 hours depending upon scenario<br/><br/>Components:<br/><br/>Two map sheets<br/>Three countersheets (5/8&quot; size)<br/>Rules booklet with updated Historical Notes<br/>Three player aid cards<br/>Three order of appearance display cards (Axis &amp; Allied)<br/>One six-sided die<br/>Box and Lid<br/><br/>",

        "description": "The Moscow Campaign; Strike and Counterstrike Russia, 1941, is the successor to SPI's earlier treatment of roughly the same events, The Battle of Moscow (originally published in Strategy &amp; Tactics magazine #24).<br/><br/>The Moscow Campaign covers the final German drives on the Russian capital and the first Soviet counteroffensive. The scale is 6 miles per hex and three days per turn.  Units (blue Germans and brown Soviets) are predominantly divisions. The Soviets have a few corps, and some German mechanized divisions are replaced by kampfgruppen if eliminated in combat. Though they have &quot;historical&quot; designations, the formations are pretty generic. They display combat factors, movement allowances and NATO symbols. Most formidable are the German 6-8 panzer divisions; most common are the lowly Soviet 1-4 infantry.<br/><br/>Games can begin as early as September 30, 1941, and end as late as December 31st. A variety of starting points, ending points and German orders of battle produce 24 scenarios, four lasting all 31 turns, the rest - centered on the German offensives in early October and late November and the Soviet riposte at the end of the year - 8 turns each.<br/><br/>The four-color map is functional though not an aesthetic gem. It shows cities, rivers, railroads, forests, swamps, lakes, Soviet fortifications and scenario start lines.<br/><br/>Players alternate turns, each having a movement phase, combat phase and second movement phase for mechanized units. Zones of control are &quot;semi-active&quot; (requiring extra movement points to enter or leave but not mandating combat between adjacent enemies). The stacking limit is three units of any size per hex.<br/><br/>The Combat Results Table has the classic Eliminate, Exchange, Retreat outcomes. Overruns during movement are also possible, though they require 11 to 1 odds. Germans must trace supply lines to railroads that have been converted by Eisenbahn Bautruppen, Soviets to unconverted rail lines that run to the north, south or east of the map. Lack of supply halves movement and combat factors but doesn't, by itself, result in elimination.<br/><br/>Weather changes historically. Rain, mud and full winter successively erode movement allowances and combat strengths.<br/><br/>There are no air or command rules.<br/><br/>Victory points are awarded for destroying enemy units and for geographical objectives (possession of Moscow for either side, proximity to Moscow for the Germans, pushing units west of the start line for the Soviets).<br/><br/>When published, this was one of SPI's largest and most sophisticated games.<br/><br/>Game Scale:<br/>Game Turn: 2 days<br/>Hex: 6 miles / 9.6 kilometers<br/>Units: Brigade to Corps<br/><br/>Game Inventory:<br/>One 22 x 34&quot; four-color mapsheet<br/>One single-side printed countersheet (400 1/2&quot; counters)<br/>One 10-page foldout Moscow Campaign folder<br/>One 6-sided die<br/><br/>Solitaire Suitability: Medium<br/>Complexity Level: Medium<br/>Players: 2 or more<br/>Playing Time: 2-4 hours<br/><br/>",

From the Japanese invasion of China in 1937 to the end of the war, the entire conflict is portrayed.<br/><br/>Like AETO, the forces in APTO are exactingly accurate and have been exhaustively researched. There's no guesswork; every piece is based on the most thorough study ever devoted to a wargame. It even features all the Soviet and Japanese forces that engaged in the Nomonhan Incident, along with the units of every nationality that fielded a military in the war. Indeed, this is actually a division-level game, and is even more detailed than the acclaimed AETO.<br/><br/>APTO and AETO can be linked to simulate the entire Second World War more accurately than any other game ever produced. This is more than an AETO supplement; though, in that it features special rules for: elite pilots, atomic bombs, midget submarines, coast-watchers, tropical disease and more.<br/><br/>Advanced PTO is the most realistic yet playable game on the subject; it includes admirals and generals, every type of aircraft and every capital ship that existed in the Pacific Theater, and even some refits. APTO represents the ultimate blend of playability and detail. In conjunction with AETO and also Africa Orientale Italiana (the East African expansion), no World War II strategic series has ever been so all-encompassing, detailed, playable and realistic.<br/><br/>Contents:<br/><br/>1,680 Die cut counters <br/>    2 34&quot; x 22&quot;  Map <br/>    2 Rule booklets &amp; 1 Scenario  booklet <br/>      Player Aid cards &amp;  display <br/>    3 Dice <br/>      Storage bags<br/><br/>",

        "description": "Kemps (also known as Canes) is played with two two-person teams. (You could play with three or four teams, but it becomes more complicated.)  Each player is dealt a hand of 4 cards from a standard deck, and then the Dealer deals four cards face-up to the center of the table.  If you're right-handed, you should keep your hand (of cards) in your left hand, and vice-versa -- this is because you are only allowed to use one hand to pick up or put down cards.<br/><br/>When everyone is ready, the Dealer says &quot;Begin&quot;, at which point the round starts.  Play is simultaneous, with no turns.  Your goal is to have all four cards in your hand of the same value (i.e. all 4 kings, or all 4 deuces).  If a card you want is on the table, pick it up, put it in your hand, and then discard a card to replace it.  If the action comes to a standstill because noone wants any of the cards on the table, the Dealer removes them, deals another four cards, and says &quot;Begin&quot; again.<br/><br/>When you have acquired a complete set, you have Kemps, but you cannot declare this yourself.  Instead, you must use a pre-arranged signal to inform your partner (which must be &quot;over the table&quot; -- no kicking your partner in the shins!), who then announces &quot;Kemps&quot;.  You show your hand, and your team gets a point.  If you or your partner misread the signal and call Kemps erroneously, the other team gets a point.  If you think you have spotted the other team's signal, you can call &quot;Kemps against&quot;, and name the player you think has Kemps.  If you are correct, your team gets a point, otherwise the other team does.  When someone has figured out the other team's signal, that team can go somewhere private to come up with a new one.<br/><br/>Play until any agreed-upon number of points.<br/><br/>",

Instead of delivering a fatal death blow that would give the Empire of Japan dominance of the Pacific region, the attack's ultimate consequence was to, in words attributed to Admiral Yamamoto, &quot;awaken a sleeping giant and fill him with a terrible resolve.&quot;<br/><br/>In The Pacific War - From Pearl Harbor to the Philippines, two players face off in an epic struggle for control of the Pacific area of operations. In action from December 1941 to June 1944, the Japanese player uses his forces against the Allied forces from the United States, Great Britain, Australia and the Netherlands. Aircraft carriers, battleships, cruisers, and land-based aircraft are all involved. With them, each player plans and conducts strategies out of a limited hand of resourcey cards to gain the initiative and defeat his enemy's forces and control crucial ports and bases across the Pacific. The Japanese are at their strongest at the beginning, and the Allies gain power and resources each turn. Few would debate Japan's chances of victory, but the goal of The Pacific War is to see whether the Japanese forces can achieve better military gains and delay its defeat. Or can the Allies win a quicker victory? It's up to the players to utilize their assets to turn the tide of the war!<br/><br/>Man, your battle station . . . It's time to fight The Pacific War!<br/><br/>",

It is a fun card-driven character building game featuring a hilarious uncontrolled narrative that unfolds differently every time.<br/><br/>As an aspiring super villain, you are trying to make your mark in the world. In Villainy you are trying to be the first villain to complete three plans to beat Fantastiman, that pesky super-hero who watches over the city day and night. You must hire minions to aid you in your quest for world domination. You will have to do crimes and go to work as your alter ego to learn the skills necessary and gain the cards required to see your great plans through to their triumphant end.<br/><br/>Today is the day that Fantastiman will fall...<br/><br/><br/>Game Mechanics Description:<br/><br/>In Villainy, players gradually build a stronger team of villains. Each turn, players typically perform a single action which may include purchasing a new team member with money, increasing one of four team member's stats, earning money, and completing objectives.<br/><br/>Each team member has three primary stats: strength, charisma, and intelligence. In addition, they can each acquire 6 abilities such as a scientific knowledge or the possession of a weapon. Team members can also gain an additional special action and extra income by purchasing an alter ego card such as a software engineer.<br/><br/>Players draw an initial objective card that describes minimum statistics and abilities a team must have to complete that objective. Players then spend turns building their team to meet those requirements. There is a pool of characters a player can purchase with money. There is another pool of crimes and alter ego cards that a player can select and which will provide money or increase a team member's stats. These pools will cycle throughout the game and choosing which cards to select and which characters to purchase are important to building a strong team.<br/><br/>Once the requirements are met, they may spend a turn to complete the objective. The first two objectives are met simply by having a team with the right requirements. The third in addition to having these requirements includes a mechanic where the team fights against Fantastiman. During this third and last objective, players will draw random challenge cards that may decrease their team stats and abilities. If the team overcomes these challenges and still meets the minimum requirements, they can then complete the fight by rolling a high value with a dice.<br/><br/>The first player to complete all three objectives is the winner.<br/><br/>There are additional challenges or fights which occur both randomly and as a player's action throughout the game. Typically these fights award a bonus to one player without hurting another. It is these challenges and several special abilities that steal from other players that make up the majority of player to player direct conflict.<br/><br/>",

A patrol had mistakenly reported a rebel camp ripe for raiding so Stone, in turn, ordered Colonel Deven to advance on the supposed camp. Having done so, Deven found nothing of the kind. Confused, he settled his men in a defensive position and awaited new orders. Stone decided to send the remainder of the 15th Massachusetts, With Colonel Edward Baker in command, across the river so that he might conduct a reconnaissance in force around Leesburg, VA. A sharp engagement ensued with Baker calling for more reinforcements. The army strength on both sides grew to approximately 1700 men.<br/><br/>Colonel Baker was killed late in the afternoon during a failed attack on the rebel line. Before long, disorganized federal troops were recrossing the river. By early evening The 18th Mississippi arrived and aided in an assault that fully routed the boys in blue. Their artillery abandoned, many Union soldiers were forced down the steep slope called Ball's Bluff and into the river. Soldiers swarmed the waiting boats. Overcrowded, several boats capsized on their way back to Harrison Island. An untold number of Federals drowned in their desperate attempt to escape. By day&rsquo;s end, 223 Union men were killed, 226 were wounded, and 553 were trapped and captured by the advancing rebels. In all, the rebels lost 36 KIA, 264 WIA, and 3 captured for a total of 303 &ndash; killed, wounded and captured.<br/><br/>Ball's Bluff is a hex-based, chit-pull system game using company sized units. It features low complexity rules and low counter density - 103 pieces. The map has been drawn by famed Civil War map creator, Rick Barber and covers the area immediately surrounding Ball's Bluff. The action represented covers only the heavy fighting which took place from the early afternoon on. Playtime, once the rules are understood will average two hours or less.<br/><br/>",

        "description": "(from The Wargamer Magazine 53:)<br/><br/>Dynamo: Dunkirk, 1940 is a strategic/operational-level simulation of the decisive middle phase of the battle for France. The first phase ended when the tanks of Panzergruppe Kleist emerged unscathed from the western end of the Ardennes Forest on 14 May, thus unhinging the entire Allied strategic plan. The third phase began on June 5, when the final drives into the heart of France were begun. For two weeks at the end of May, the Allies had a final chance to rebalance the situation. Had they succeeded in stabilizing a supplied bridgehead on the Flanders coast, or managed to smash the thinly-spread German mechanized formations while breaking out southward, all of subsequent World War II history would have been changed. Alternately, had the Germans succeeded in bagging the whole of the B.E.F., there would have been little or nothing to stop an Operation Sealion and no troops to send to North Africa.<br/><br/>Game has a 12 turn Campaign scenario, and a 7/5 turn &quot;No Halt Order&quot; scenario to examine the ramifications of Hitler's mistake. The ratio of playing area to unit quantity creates high-density combat and fluid gameplay situations. The simulation is at the intermediate level of complexity, and suitable for solitaire play<br/><br/>",

Each unit represents either one vehicle or one &quot;fireteam&quot; (four infantrymen).<br/><br/>The game scale is 50 meters per hex and 40 seconds per Game-Turn. Each Game-Turn is comprised of a Fire Phase, followed by a Movement Phase, during which the players alternate moving units (those that have not fired), and terminating with an Indirect Fire Phase, during which the players employ and assess fire from off-map artillery and mortar units.<br/><br/>Firefight makes extensive use of tables to express the strength of a firing unit against a particular target at a given distance. This strength (or firepower rating) is then referred to a Combat Results Table. This procedure allows us to rate different weapon systems versus different target types with much greater accuracy than heretofore. Another innovation is the integration of the terrain effects directly onto the CRT's. Results are colour-coded to graphically display the protection offered by woods, building and defilade (hull-down) positions. The whole effect is a much simpler, but more accurate system of combat.<br/><br/>Firefight is presented in three stages. Firefight I, II and III. Firefight I introduces the player to the fundamental game system. Firefight II introduces more complex rules, which add realistic effects yo play. Firefight III explores the effects of weapons systems presently under development.<br/><br/><br/>(from the SPI soap box cover:)<br/><br/>Modern US and Soviet Small Unit Tactics<br/><br/>A Fascinating Future-History Simulation Game<br/>the time is: The First Battle of the Next War<br/><br/>What if the US and USSR were to meet in a conventional war? Firefight highlights the dynamics of today's battlefield and includes an intensive survey of battlefield tactics and doctrine. The range and lethality of weapons in each country's service are contrasted as players use the tactical deployment of their combined arms system to test the capabilities of their small tactical units. Firefight simulates this possible conflict on a map based on US Army specifications of probable terrain conditions. Colorful cardboard playing pieces move, position, and engage for battle through a superimposed hexagonal grid, which functions like a chessboard's squares. Simple probability charts determine each combat's outcome.<br/><br/>Contains: comprehensive historical situation briefing; 20 page rules booklet; 400 die-cut cardboard playing pieces; two different 22&quot; x 34&quot; soft map sections; and various playing aids.<br/><br/>Level of Complexity: Moderate<br/>Average Playing Time: 2 hours<br/>Suitability for Solitaire Play: Moderate<br/><br/>",

The player controls the Irish forces fighting the British, then, after the treaty with Britain, plays the role of Michael Collins' Free State forces against the anti-treaty Republicans.<br/><br/>Components:<br/><br/>    Map<br/>    Rules<br/>    British counters (Army, RIC, Black &amp; Tans, UVF)<br/>    Irish Free State counters (Mob, Guerillas, Regulars, A/Car, Artillery)<br/>    Irish Republican counters (Mob, Guerillas, Flying column)<br/>    D6 is required<br/><br/><br/>Playing time = 30-60 minutes.<br/><br/>Game play: <br/>As the Irish player, you must first force the British to end the war in a treaty. This is done by denying areas of the country to them and eliminating British units. After this is completed, the Irish forces split along the line of the civil war. As the Free State (pro-treaty) player you will likely be initially outnumbered by the Republicans (anti-treaty), but with superior organisation and tactics, you can force their surrender.<br/><br/>Historical background and the game: There are very few games on either the Irish war of independence, or the subsequent civil war. The war of independence can be indirectly blamed on the Germans. In 1912, after years (centuries, some would say) of resistance, the British parliament passed the Irish Home Rule bill. The bill then began to grind its way through parliament to become law. This was widely approved in Ireland, apart from the North-east, where the largely Protestant population feared for their future in what would be a largely Catholic state. They started to arm themselves as the Ulster Volunteer Force (UVF), and so did their Irish nationalist adversaries. Civil war looked likely, but was happily averted by the sudden arrival of several million heavily armed Germans in Belgium and France. Both the UVF and the Nationalists then happily joined the British army to fight the common foe. Meanwhile, the home rule bill was suspended for the war's duration, but sure it would all be over by Christmas... wouldn't it?<br/><br/>It wasn't, and by 1916 some more radical Nationalists (called Republicans) got fed up and in Easter staged a farcical uprising, limited to those units that didn't get the message that it had been called off. It was crushed, but the hanging of the leaders, and the increasing harshness of British measures as the war progressed caused a sea-change in public opinion. In the 1918 general election, almost all of Ireland (not the North-east) voted in the Sinn Fein party, which refused to sit in the British parliament and, in 1919 declared Irish independence. Desultory fighting started between the new Irish Republican Army (IRA) and British forces. This is the point at which the game starts, with IRA units of varying capability in most areas of Ireland, and British garrisons (mostly Royal Irish Constabulary) throughout. In 1920 the home rule bill (remember it) passed, but by now with a special amendment allowing two parliaments - one for the North-east (now called Northern Ireland) and one for the rest of Ireland. Sinn Fein ignored it, as they already considered themselves independent, while Northern Ireland voted itself into existence. The game shows this effect with Northern Ireland having extra military units of the UVF.<br/><br/>As the war progressed, the IRA were most successful in the Southern parts of Ireland, and the British forces were gradually excluded from the countryside and limited to towns. The game simulates this by giving different units different strength depending on the terrain - IRA guerillas and Flying columns are best in the countryside, the British better in the urban areas.<br/><br/>With neither side able to win, and the British half expecting the home rule bill to have solved things in the first place, a peace treaty was signed. The treaty gave Southern Ireland (now called the Free State) Dominion status (like in Australia or Canada), with the King still as head of state, and cemented the separation of Northern Ireland. Naturally, this disgusted the more radical elements of Sinn Fein (led by Eamon De Valera), and military units who considered that they had won and so should have full independence. An election in 1922 was won handily by the pro-treaty Sinn Fein, but this did not solve things and fighting started as the pro-treaty forces, under Michael Collins, started to assert themselves over the anti-treaty forces. At this point, the players forces are split - largely along historical lines, with the South containing more anti-treaty forces, and the East more pro-treaty forces. As the player, you control the Free State forces against the anti-treaty republicans. This also means that you need to be careful how you fight the British since you will be raising troops that may not be loyal to the Free State!<br/><br/>Initially outnumbered, the Free State forces rapidly mobilised and quite quickly crushed the Republicans. They used innovative tactics, notably landing troops by ship at key points behind enemy lines, and were able to win battles because they generally had artillery and armour (armoured cars) while the republicans didn't. In the game you can perform naval landings, and you have attached artillery and armoured car units to give a bonus in combat.<br/><br/>Victory is decided by two things - How quickly the British are beaten, and how quickly/completely the Republicans are beaten.<br/><br/>",

Planning to crash through the formidable French defuses with the heaviest concentration of artillery in the history of warfare, he would threaten, or even seize the city and then let the French bleed to death in a series of suicidal counter-attacks.  It almost worked; only the combination of bad weather and a skillful defense guaranteed that the German casualties would be as bad as the French.  Bit could've been different.  This time with you as the generals, it very well might&quot;<br/><br/>",

This was a fairy-tale place of terrible cruelty and fantastic legends. But then one day they found themselves elsewhere again, in a world called Yashima. This time they were joined by another hero of legend, Bruce Lee. Together they find themselves in a new world, and unlike the kami masters native to this land, their battle is in the hopes that each encounter may give them a clue on how they may return home.<br/><br/>Yashima: Legends from Fairytale is both a standalone two-player game as well as an expansion for Yashima: Legend of the Kami Masters that allows you to add two additional players to that base game. Combine these two items with Yashima: Legend of the Deep Woods and Yashima: Legends of the Icy Peaks for epic eight-player team-based showdowns!<br/><br/><br/>    Play as Lu Bu to shock and awe opponents with raw power and a cavalier attitude towards your allies. <br/>    Play as Bruce Lee to counter your opponent's attacks, turning their offense into yours. <br/>    Play as Musashi to use unmatched agility and blur the lines between movement and strikes. <br/>    Play as Mulan to exploit your opponent's weaknesses with indirect tactics and redirect their own skills against them.<br/><br/><br/>",

Exiled from a once glorious city, tribes of scavengers are all that remains of a scientifically advanced humanity.<br/><br/>As the regular offering to the gods was delayed, the ground split open and vile Beasts arose from the Abyss, relentlessly attacking everyone in their path. Driven out of their home and left for dead in the harsh desert, the people have lost all hope, until an unexpected discovery was made.<br/><br/>Turris is a competitive Worker Placement game where players attempt to build the Tower as a final defense mechanism, utilizing the prehistoric technology of divine origin. You assign your Scouts to acquire resources and decipher the data from ancient machinery, all the while being constantly chased (and often devoured) by the unstoppable Beasts. The tribes all follow the Council's directives and complete its missions, but as a tribe leader you know that once the Tower is built and humanity is saved, it will dissolve without strong leadership. In building the Tower, you acquire Prestige Points which represent your standing amongst the tribes. The leader with the most Prestige will take control of the Council and lead humanity into the future &mdash; whatever it may be.<br/><br/>Turris uses miniatures that represent the Beasts and Scouts, decks of Mission and Tactics cards, as well as Tarot-sized gold/silver lined Trionfi cards which represent the Tower rooms.<br/><br/>",

On any turn, the Picturist (the person drawing) may choose to play one of the Fun Phrase cards instead of the regular cards.  If the team guesses correctly, they may add two points to their next roll of the standard die.<br/><br/>A nice change of pace for those who like this classic drawing game.<br/><br/>",

        "description": "S.Y.N.C. is the cooperative game where players choose the character (phantom) cards that are best linked with the available sets of associations. The trick is that the players are not allowed to communicate with each other before they make up their choice and to win the round all of the players need to pick one and only one character from the available pool. The difficulty grows with each round as the pool of the characters to choose from is increasing.<br/><br/>The objective of the game is to gather members of the space expedition among the phantoms of the past (historical personalities) and phantoms from the imaginary world (fictional characters). Players need to choose only one phantom card, that is best linked with the generated association key-cards. Each player makes the choice secretly, without discussion with the team. To win the round, all players must unanimously point at the same phantom. To win the game the players must win 5 rounds within maximum of 9 attempts.<br/><br/>S.Y.N.C. legend<br/>S.Y.N.C. (Synchronizing Neuro-Connector) is a super-computer that allowed humanity to establish contacts with the new worlds using the power of synchronizing minds. It has become possible to teleport phantom messengers of the Earth from the past or from the mysterious dimension of fantasies to the distant corners of the Universe. The experiment requires a group of people who can use S.Y.N.C. technology to assemble an expedition of five phantoms and send them to discover new space horizons. But be careful as five unsuccessful sessions will reboot the system and you will have to start all over again. The key to the success of the mission is the unity of thoughts and feelings of the participants. Synchronize with each other and discover the power of the collective mind as you connect via S.Y.N.C.<br/><br/>S.Y.N.C. DISCOVERY is the 1st game in the S.Y.N.C. family and very soon there will be new modules available including traitor expansion, campaign expansion, new phantom card sets and new assoication key-cards sets. Stay tuned :)<br/><br/>",

        "description": "Blood on the Ohio presents the late 18th century struggle between a coalition of Indian tribes led by Little Turtle and the nascent American Army to determine control of the then Ohio territory. Known as the Northwest Indian War, Little Turtle's War and Washington's Indian War, this was the first major challenge to President Washington and his army following the conclusion of the Revolutionary War. Spanning from 1785 to 1795, the conflict grew out of a dispute over territorial boundaries following the war, aggravated by settlers flooding across the Ohio to claim Ohio lands then in possession of Native American nations.<br/><br/>The Miami and Shawnee were the principal tribes involved but in time they created a loose alliance with numerous other tribes and together they dealt the U.S. the worst defeat by Indians in the history of our Indian Wars. Washington sent three separate expeditions against them. The first two were handily defeated. The third and final expedition led by General &quot;Mad&quot; Anthony Wayne ended the conflict with his victory at The Battle of Fallen Timbers in 1794.<br/><br/>This design is similar to KING PHILIP'S WAR published by MMP in 2010. It is point to point movement, using a three dice simultaneous battle system with variable reinforcements on both sides, special action points, alliances and treaties, and frustratingly undependable American militia. The American army operates out of forts, the Indians out of villages. Every two turns both players enter into quartering which in effect resets the board. Destroyed Indian villages are relocated while additional forts and settlements may be built as the game progresses. Indians raiding is a quick and simple mechanism that adds color to the game. The action is hardly battle-line simple. Engagements are widespread and chaotic with surprises at every turn. Four scenarios are included - one per expedition with a campaign game that encompasses all three. Low counter density with quick and tense game play. Simple to learn.<br/><br/>",

On a turn, draw and reveal a card, then place it at any empty seat at any table. Romantics want to sit with one another; goblins want to sit with their leader; and nobles prefer to be on their own so that no one outshines their royalty. Scrolls serve as events.<br/><br/>Once all the tables are full, score each player's tips, and after a certain number of rounds, whoever collected the most money wins.<br/><br/>",

Due to time dilation and other pseudo-scientific malarkey, the lower you travel in the 'verses, the greater number of actions you have each round &mdash; but some of those lower 'verses are a bit primitive, so the contraptions you build to use all that sweet power on might not work that well!<br/><br/>During your turn, you spend your actions to build power supplies and contraptions, and you possibly move to a new 'verse to take advantage of some excess power there. At the end of each round, the power generates from the bottom 'verse up, and players can use that power as it travels from 'verse to 'verse to play one-shot abilities, use character abilities, and power-up their contraptions. Player order matters in each 'verse, so hopefully your opponents left you some power to use!<br/><br/>&mdash;description from the publisher<br/><br/>",

Submarines, destroyers, mines and torpedo boats also all play their roles.&quot;<br/><br/>Two to Four players command squadrons of battleships and aircraft carriers and the side that scores the most victory points by sinking enemy vessels and winning sorties wins the game.<br/><br/>Variations in ship attack, capability, and defense values are represented by using different types and numbers of dice.<br/><br/>",

However, this morning, a newspaper article catches your eye which forecasts your doom.<br/><br/>The Turkey Trial, title #7 in the Holiday Hijinks line, is an escape room style game in just 18 cards! As a group, you will solve a series of puzzles to unravel a mystery.<br/><br/>When you have solved a puzzle, you will enter the answer into the companion web app (compatible with all smart phones and computers) and it will check whether you are correct. If you are, the app will tell you which card or cards to take next.<br/><br/>The app also contains a graduated hint system, so if you get stuck you can get just a small hint about the current puzzle to get moving again without giving too much away.<br/><br/>Puzzles may test your perception, wordplay, and lateral thinking. English language fluency is required. Knowledge of traditional Christmas topics is helpful, but that information is also provided in the app if you need it.<br/><br/>Most groups take about an hour to solve the game. You can write on the cards to help solve puzzles, but this is not required (or you could use penny sleeves) and the game is otherwise non-destructable. So while you can't play again yourself, you could give the used game to someone else to play.<br/><br/>&mdash;description from the publisher<br/><br/>",

During their turn, the active player can uncover in sequence up to four cards from the pile. If the same kind of fruit appears one after the other, then all cards uncovered in this turn are lost for the player. Since there are only three fruit sorts, this occurs regularly, so this provides tension both for children and adults.<br/><br/>If a player has more than six of a set, then he loses everything that he collected so far from this set.<br/><br/>If the player has exactly six pieces of a set, the player then receives a gopher trophy in exchange for the set. The first to get his third cup wins the game.<br/><br/>This game is not only pure gambling, but also offers tactical choices so children take part enthusiastically. The minimum age indicated by the manufacturer seems applicable as long as the child can count over six.<br/><br/>",

That theater saw two major campaigns: one in which the forces of the British Empire contested control of the vital Suez Canal and Jerusalem regions with the Ottoman Turks and their German allies; and the Arab Revolt, in which Thomas E. Lawrence (&quot;Lawrence of Arabia&quot;) took a leading role. Both campaigns featured several of the major mobile actions of the Great War. At stake was nothing less than control of the entire Middle East.<br/><br/>The game has two players: the Allies (British and Arab Rebels) and Central Powers (Ottoman Turks and Germans). Players move and attack with their units in their own discrete turns. The objective is to capture critical cities and thereby win the war in this theater. The game map is divided into two theaters, the Western and Eastern, in which separate campaigns are conducted.<br/><br/>No Prisoners also includes an optional alternative command system, in which both players control opposing British and Central Powers units in the two map sectors, in the same manner as in old-SPI's classic Battle for Germany game. In that option, the two maps' Allied forces race against each other for victory.<br/><br/>Each hexagon on the map equals 12.4 miles (20 kilometers) across, and each game turn represents three months of operations. The units of maneuver for both sides are primarily regiments, brigades and divisions. There are 176 large-size (5/8&quot;) NATO-style (and some iconic) unit-counters in the game.<br/><br/>",

        "description": "From the Atlas Games website: &quot;The industrious yet short-sighted Seismic Asphalt &amp; Paving Company -- located in the sleepy town of San Andreas, California -- has put you in charge of one of its many road crews. Your job is to build a network of roadways around San Andreas proper. But San Andreas is rather prone to earthquakes, which have a tendency to destroy the beautiful stretches of pavement you've been laying. After all the asphalt is put down, which road crew will end up connecting the most highway in between quakes?&quot;<br/><br/>In Seismic, players place hexagonal highway tiles to build long, complete sections of highways, scoring points for each tile as well as bonus points for the ending &quot;intersection&quot; tiles in their routes. Scores aren't tallied until the end of the game, because at any time, earthquakes can occur, destroying tiles along the most-built direction leading out from the central &quot;San Andreas&quot; tile. Players constantly need to be claiming as many long roadways as possible while ensuring that their highways aren't the ones that are going to be destroyed if and when an earthquake occurs.<br/><br/>",

Each game in the series covers a separate bridge: Arnhem, Eindhoven, and Nijmegen. As a player, you must command your German or Allied forces so as to capture key objectives on the board while keeping your casualties down (and your opponent&rsquo;s casualties up).<br/><br/>Nijmegen Bridge is the third and final game in the Market-Garden series, covering the events happening at this vital river crossing from September 17th-19th, 1944. The central Nijmegen sector of the attack crossed an arm of the Rhine that could not be bridged easily. If the US 82nd Airborne failed to capture the Nijmegen cross, the advance of XXX Corps would be checked and Operation Market-Garden would fail.<br/><br/>With plenty of decision making and Optional Rules to extend gameplay and realism, the Allied advance into Germany hangs in the balance at Nijmegen Bridge!<br/><br/>Game Data:<br/><br/>Complexity: 3 on a 9 scale<br/>Solitaire Suitability: 8 on a 9 scale<br/>Unit scale: Each unit is 1 company to regiment, each hex is 0.6 kilometers, each (day) turn is about 4.5 hours, and each (night) turn is about 10 hours.<br/><br/>",

It's time to find out!<br/><br/>Evolution: Another World is a card game in a beloved Evolution: the Origin of Species series. In the game, you create animals and give them traits, so they survive and thrive in the chaotic world of wondrous creatures. The goal of the game is to give your creatures enough energy to transmute and transcend their state of existence. The first player to transmute three creatures wins the game.<br/><br/>This is a fast-paced, easy-to-learn game with a solo mode included in the core game. Mechanically, it is inspired by Evolution: New World, but trades some complexity for more dynamic and light gameplay.<br/><br/>This game is Family-friendly because animals can&rsquo;t die or be eaten by predators. Competition is peaceful, but you can attack other players' creatures to gain energy. This game has a straightforward win condition: you don't need to count VP at the end of the game.

        "description": "Zombie World is a card-based tabletop roleplaying game of survivors fighting against the living and the dead for their own place in the world. The game is designed for easy, quick, and intense play.<br/><br/>In Zombie World, you take on the roles of ordinary people caught up in a zombie apocalypse, struggling to survive day after day, month after month, year after year, in a world destroyed by the restless dead. Maybe you&rsquo;re just an accountant who took up a machete to keep her friends and family safe. Maybe you&rsquo;re an escaped inmate trying to keep your criminal past a secret from your fellow survivors. Maybe you&rsquo;re a soldier trying to lead and protect your whole enclave in this ruined world.<br/><br/>Zombie World has its roots in the Powered by the Apocalypse system used by tabletop RPGs like Apocalypse World, Monsterhearts, and Masks: A New Generation, but it takes that system in new directions, using special cards to generate characters, create situations, and resolve conflicts. Making a new character takes minutes: you draw a few cards, and you&rsquo;re ready to go. Every time you take an interesting action in the game, you draw a few cards that will tell you what happens to your survivor. In Zombie World, your story is about the larger group of characters more than it is about any single one of them, as you struggle, sacrifice, and strive to create a place where you and your allies might not just survive...but where you might live.<br/><br/>Zombie World comes with all the cards, the playmats, the rules, and even a dry erase marker&mdash;everything you need in a small box you can easily fit into your bag and play on the fly. If you&rsquo;re a fan of The Walking Dead, Night of the Living Dead, Dawn of the Dead, 28 Days Later, or World War Z, then Zombie World is the perfect game to satisfy your hunger!<br/><br/>&mdash;description from the publisher<br/><br/>",

        "description": "Since the beginning of time, gnomes have been the humble caretakers of nature. In secret they emerge from their underground homes to maintain meticulous rings of mushrooms known to the humanfolk as &quot;fairy rings&quot;. But the work must be done quickly because as soon as a mushroom path is finished, the mushrooms are ready for picking. Who will be the cleverest gnome and harvest the most mushrooms by the end of the season?<br/><br/>Gnome Hollow is a spatial, tile-placement, worker-placement game in which you grow a tabletop garden of mushrooms and flowers. Every piece is a hand-painted watercolor that captures the whimsical feel of gnomes and nature. Turns are deceptively simple: Players place tiles into the garden, and move a gnome to take a single action on their turn.<br/><br/>But placing a tile and taking an action can create play combinations that are intensely satisfying. Players strategically place tiles and develop rings of valuable mushrooms. Once a ring is completed, they harvest each mushroom and eventually carry them to market to sell for the shiniest treasures available in the hollow.<br/><br/>Small mushroom rings offer small rewards. Larger mushroom rings offer richer rewards! Completing a new circle automatically increases your score. The player board automatically calculates your growing score every time you move a ring marker to unlock your latest reward. This means that every completed mushroom ring offers new strategic choices and important bonuses for individual players.<br/><br/>As you grow the garden, some rewards give players access to rare signposts. Once placed in completed rings, signposts become unique worker placement spots for any of the gnomes in the Hollow.<br/><br/>Wildflowers are literally wilds and can complete any ring, or solve complicated problems during play. Planting them grants players a wildflower token. Other players can move to a flower as an action to collect that same wildflower token. When these tokens are placed into the individual player boards, these become a valuable set-collection strategy, while simultaneously building toward the end of the game.<br/><br/>Gnomes visit the Pinwheel Market to fulfill mushroom orders to gain treasure in the form of bottle caps, buttons, feathers, crystals, and skeleton keys. Each card offers two options. You can choose to fulfill the top portion to grab a bit of treasure, or fulfill the bottom to gain the most. The white part of the card gives players a mushroom trade that can be used in future turns by visiting sign posts.<br/><br/>Clever players will plan their strategy carefully, balancing the building of mushroom rings with trips to the market, as well as expanding their personal collection of wildflowers that grow across the garden. As the game progresses, it is as much about playing a beautiful game as it is a wonderful journey to strategically outplay your opponents.<br/><br/>Come to Gnome Hollow and experience a peaceful garden, the thrill of competing to harvest buckets of mushrooms, and the reward of gathering in all your shiny treasures!<br/><br/>",

The game is designed for 1-3 players.<br/><br/>All three of the King Sanchos, including any non-player Sanchos, are competing to win by fortifying the castles and towers illustrated on the board (one in each region). Players gain victory points for each castle or tower fortified with their pieces: 3 points for a home castle (2 points in the solo game), 2 points for a neutral castle, and 1 point for a tower. If at any time during the game a Sancho has 10 or more victory points, they win a major victory. If no player achieves this during the game, the Sancho with the most victory points after the last card is played wins a minor victory.<br/><br/>The game is played in rounds. Each player has a turn during each round. At the start of the round, the commander for the round plays a card from their hand. This card indicates the number of command points (CPs) from 1 to 3 that the commander uses during the round, and it also describes the actions that each other player must take on their turn, if possible. The game ends either at any point when a Sancho has 10 or more victory points, or after the final card from all players' hands has been resolved.<br/><br/>",

In Riftwalker, players use a central grid of elements composed of earth, wind, fire, water, storm, and life to play rift cards from their hand or shift rifts they already have in play.<br/><br/>Shifting a Rift is a Riftwalker's magical ability to change the nature of a place by calling on and altering the elements. Shifting turns a card sideways and increases its point value. Every time a rift card is played or shifted, it activates a special power that alters a player's cards or the central grid in a useful way. As the game progresses, players will build up a unique set of abilities.<br/><br/>Earth rifts empower shifted rifts while fire burns them down for points. Water rifts spread more rifts across the land and life rifts grow them to great value. Storm rifts control the element grid and wind rifts play all kinds of tricks. However, a rift can only be shifted twice, so no power lasts forever. Eventually, players must create lines of elements on the grid to score their rifts. Some cards give bonus points for scoring the right kind of rifts. In the end, the player with the greatest rifts and the most points wins the game!<br/><br/>",

        "description": "During the last space trip, a famous game console was forgotten by a crew member of the Soyuz. It was found by some aliens, that, trying to decipher the cartridge inside it... released thousands of pieces, which drift aimlessly and dangerously through space! Now, they ask humans for help to capture the pieces and clean, thus, the space superhighways.<br/><br/>Intending to keep the diplomacy across the Galaxy, the International Earthling Government has organized a selection system to fing the best pieces collectors, named PLETRIX. DO YOU DARE TO JOIN IT?<br/><br/>Pletrix is a game of 1 to 6 players, with a Roll and Write dynamic. The goal is to fill the 5 panels of our board (A,<br/>B, C, D, and E), using the figures obtained in the dice of the corresponding color. The player who gets the highest<br/>score will be the winner.<br/><br/>Dices:<br/><br/>There are 10 dice with the figures of the polynomials. 2 dice of each color from one of the 5 panels.<br/><br/>Panels:<br/><br/>Pletrix is a Roll&amp;Write game in which we must fill in our 5 panels. Each panel is identified with a letter and a color. To place the figures, the player must be able to choose the group of dice of the same color. You start in one of the initial cells and place the shapes always orthogonally adiacent to another.<br/><br/>Each panel has its own rules for placement and scoring:<br/><br/>A PANEL - The final score for this panel will be the result of subtracting twice the number of cells that haven&acute;t been covered from the total number of cells in the panel. For example, if the player has left 10 cells uncovered, they will subtract 20 from the total number of cells, which is 50, so their score will be 30.<br/><br/>B PANEL- In this Panel, each covered cell equals one point. If there is a tie, the player with the most points on this panel will win.<br/><br/>C PANEL- The figures in this panel &quot;fall from above&quot; so they will stop where they encounter an obstacle, like Tetris. When completing a line the player will indicate whis by crossing out the corresponding circle. The panel is also divided into 2 5x5 grids, when completing one of them, the player will cross out the circle. Each crossed-out circle is worth 10 points.<br/><br/>D PANEL- This panel awars as many point as indicates by the star cells you have covered with figures.<br/><br/>E PANEL- This panel is filled from left to right. To score the value displayed by the circles, the different sections must by completely filled in. If there are any unfilled shares, the previus value will be scored. For example, the player has reached 40, but in the section from 30 to 40, there are empty cells, so the player will only score 30 points.<br/><br/>The most important cells within the boards are:<br/><br/>Start- The first figure must be always touching at least one of the star cells.<br/><br/>Bonus - These special cells grant actions we can activate later. When covering a Bonus cell, the player will draw a line across the corresponding cell to show they got it, and when the action is used, they will draw anoter line forming an X.<br/><br/>Double - Duplicate a group of dice that we&acute;ve chosen.<br/><br/>Copy -  Copies a single die of the ones we have chosen.<br/><br/>Roll: This allows you to roll the dice again. This action can only by perfomed by the active player.<br/><br/>1 and 2 - Give us the possibilitu to fill 1 or 2 cells. This bonus can&acute;t be saved, it is an immediate action.<br/><br/>Figures - When we completely cover a figure that is highlighted on the panel, we get that figure, being able to draw it wherever we want.<br/><br/>Figures blocked panel C - Some figures in panel C are blocked, to unblock them we&acute;ll have to fill them in panel D.<br/><br/>SETUP<br/><br/>To star playing, each player takes a notepad and a pencil, leave the dice in the center of the table.<br/><br/>GAMEROUND<br/><br/>First, the active player throws all the dice. Then, choose 2 groups of dice to draw the figures shown on their panels. To do this, the player will have to circle the cells drawing the figure in the panel of the same color of the chosen dice. Whenever possible, it is mandatory to place the figures, if it&acute;s not possible, mark one of the error boxes.<br/><br/>Then, choose a group of dice to put aside, no player will be able to use those dice during this round. The player on their left will take one of the two remaining sets of dice and the rest of the players will have to draw the figures displayed by the remaining dice.<br/><br/>When everyone has drawn their shapes, the player on the left will be the next active player.<br/><br/>ENDGAME<br/><br/>The end is triggered in 2 ways. Ifa a player completes 3 panels, the game ends immediately. If a player marks the third erro box, the game ends when all players have been an active player for the same number of rounds.<br/><br/>At the end of the game, the score is counted. The player with the highest score is the winner. In the case of a tie, the winner is the plauer with the highestscore in panel B, and if it persists, the winner is the player with the highest score in Panel C and then in panel D.<br/><br/>Pletrix is a game for the whole family, easy, fast and very fun.<br/><br/>",

        "description": "Before the civilizations that we know of there was a great island, called by contemporary scientists Atlantis. It was inhabited by a civilization that had extraordinary cultural and technological achievements, especially in architecture and art.<br/><br/>All that wouldn&rsquo;t have been possible if they hadn&rsquo;t been blessed by the gods, who the Atlants honored by building glorious monuments for them. And the gods didn&rsquo;t mind that they weren&rsquo;t the only ones being cherished by the Atlants. Alas, the plan of the gods was not perfect. Things went awry because of the younger generation of the gods.<br/><br/>Specifically it was Ares, the son of Zeus and Hera, whose actions resulted in the disaster. His wickedness was endless, and the cruelty of his followers and the destruction they caused initiated civil war in the land that had only known peace. The emerged conflict divided both the Atlants and their deities. Before those events, the gods had taken pleasure in watching their folk grow, but then they started to interfere with the people&rsquo;s affairs as well as fight one another. Some of the old gods had predicted that this civilization would eventually collapse due to the ever growing conflict between the deities. Conflict in which people&rsquo;s lives would mean nothing.<br/><br/>So, they decided to protect their followers by sending numerous visions to their priests or by taking a human form and acting as prophets. They would warn Atlants that the end was nigh and tell them about distant lands that could be their only hope for survival.<br/><br/>Rage of the gods kept growing until one day the eldest one, Nammu, the creator of the primeval sea, in her despair decided to end the Atlants&rsquo; suffering by sinking the island. With the help of their gods some of the Atlants managed to survive. They arrived at various parts of the world, bringing their knowledge to the cultures emerging there.<br/><br/>In Atlantis: Island of Gods players are the highest priests of the mythological gods, for whom they erect monuments on the mythical island of Atlantis right before its doom. It's a logical card game with four boards representing the regions of Atlantis.<br/><br/>Each turn, players take five actions during which they can recruit new followers of their deity, celebrate feasts in their honor, and build new temples. The goal of the game is to be the first to build all the temples of the player's deity which grants them god's favor and survival of the imminent catastrophe.<br/><br/>",

Dice are rolled several times with the player saving good dice, throwing out sixes, and rerolling others for a better score. Special cards add a lot of flavor to the dice battles.

But be careful, for those same friends wield powerful item cards that threaten to change the game at any moment!<br/><br/>Now combine this with a leveling system to keep it competitive and a damage system to make it vindictive and this is BaRPiG - The unholy result of a one night stand between card-based role-playing games and a mostly ridiculous party. This seriously fun and highly portable game is perfect for anyone, anywhere and everywhere.<br/><br/>Oh, and there will be pigs...<br/><br/>What started as a bunch of silly puns written on a bar napkin has since become our out of control hobby.<br/><br/>",

To achieve this aim, the players can explore the mine, fighting monsters and facing other dangers. Is also possible to get the gold attacking other player&rsquo;s dungeons, if you find one of the old hidden passageways to do it...<br/><br/>Each player takes the role of a goblin dungeon master in order to create his own dungeon, choosing between the different types of goblins, and building different rooms to upgrade the dungeon. <br/>Goblins en la mina is crazy humorously game for all the family, and the art is done to create this atmosphere. Lots of fun and laughts are assured with each play of this game.  <br/>Goblins is also a game that contributes (giving part of its benefits) to a solidarity association called Ayudar Jugando. This association works and collaborates in different causes related with children in difficult situations.<br/><br/>",

It's a hidden information, bluffing, and deduction family game.<br/><br/>During setup, each player receives a hand of 5 cards and 10 coins (which are hidden). Regardless of the number of players, there are always five cemeteries on the table which each receive one card at the start of the game.<br/><br/>On a player's turn, the player reveals one of their action tiles and performs the action on it. There are four possible actions:<br/>1. Play a card - The player plays a card from their hand face down to one of the five cemeteries and then draws back up to five cards.<br/>2. Look at one card - The player looks at one face down card on one of the cemeteries (while not showing it to other players).<br/>3. Reveal one card - The player has to reveal and leave face up one of the cards laying down in one of the cemeteries.<br/>4. Rob the cemetery - The player has to choose which cemetery the players will rob.<br/><br/>When robbing the cemetery, each player chooses the amount of money that they wish to invest in robbing it. Then all amounts are revealed simultaneously. All the cards that lay face down in the cemetery are revealed and the amount of money that can be robbed is shown. The player who bid the least takes his loot first. They take the money invested and the same amount from the cemetery following by other players. If there is insufficient money for one of the players, they take nothing from the cemetery, and so do the players after them.<br/><br/>Apart from money cards, there are also special cards which change the outcome of the robbery:<br/><br/>     Guard - Prevent the players from stealing the money. Everyone who invested 0 in this robbery receives 5 regardless of the money in the cemetery.<br/>     Bandit - Prevent the players from stealing the money and also steal the money invested in this robbery by all players.<br/>     Accomplice - Reverse the order of players taking the money.<br/>     Widow - Cancels all other special cards.<br/><br/><br/>When the deck is depleted, play continues until one of the players uses all of their cards. After that, the players rob all the cemeteries one after another and then the game is over. The player who earned the most coins is the winner.<br/><br/>",

        "description": "The City of Heroes Customizable Card Game (COHCCG) was designed by David Williams and produced by Alderac Entertainment Group (AEG). There were a total of two sets of cards released for the game. The first, Arena, was released in January, 2006. The second set, Secret Origins, was released in October, 2006. Since then, there have been no official releases.<br/><br/>The COHCCG was designed to be a quick game. Rather than using a turn structure where each player takes multiple actions in a row, the game used an alternating action structure. This lead to faster and more interactive games. Each player was represented by a Hero card, which began play with 2 starting powers. As their action, a player had many choices, including:<br/><br/><br/>    Play a card, being:<br/>         a Sidekick<br/>         a Power that can be used by the Hero or a Sidekick<br/>         an Enhancement on a Power already in play<br/>         an Edge card with the keyword &quot;Action&quot; or &quot;React&quot;<br/>    <br/>    Activate a Power already in play<br/>    Move the Hero or a Sidekick<br/>    Search your draw deck for a Sidekick<br/>    Recharge your Powers<br/>    Play a Mission card<br/>    Use the Defeat text on a mission to complete it<br/>    Draw 2 cards<br/><br/><br/>Unless otherwise specified by the cards played, play continued until only one Hero remained, who was declared the winner.<br/><br/>In addition to the 33 Heroes available in Arena and the 22 Heroes available in Secret Origins, players could create their own hero using &quot;Paragon&quot; Hero cards. These cards allowed a player to create new combinations of powers that were not available on existing Hero cards. Players could either play solely with the Paragon Hero cards available in the Arena set, or go online to access the HeroBuilder which allowed players to create Hero cards in the same template as the already available Heroes, including a picture uploaded by the player.<br/><br/>After the game was discontinued, a fan community effort created the Hamidon set.  Although the generic Hero cards listed all power sets available to the archetypes at the time, it wasn't until The Hamidon set was developed that many of those power sets were codified for use.<br/><br/>",

Confederate forces must go on the attack to win while the Union army struggles to protect Washington, DC and Baltimore.  The map is very basic and players each have about 20 units each to control, creating a game that focuses on Civil War-era strategy rather than details and chrome.<br/><br/>Confederate units are divisions while Union units are corps and cavalry are represented by brigades.  Rules cover dummies units, cavalry probes and screens, forced marches, rail movement, and leadership and command issues while the units take losses by steps.  Although not visually appealing, &ldquo;Lee Moves North&rdquo; is a playable and subtle game of two Civil War campaigns at the operational level.<br/><br/><br/>Uses a system similar to SPI's The Wilderness Campaign: Lee vs. Grant, 1864.<br/><br/>",

Other key advantages of the game &ndash; all the players are in the game all the time and you get both competitive (each player plays for himself) and cooperative modes in one box.<br/><br/>How to play the game: <br/><br/>     Take your cards in hand as your personal deck, and move the first card slightly down. The numbers of the second card indicate the words of the first card - they are your challenge!<br/>     Describe (or rather bridge) your challenge words with a one-word clue. The players have an option to choose how many challenge words (2 or 3) they will bridge.<br/>     Speak out your clue and show your card - other players should rack their brains to be the first who guess all the words you described. <br/><br/><br/>The players have only one try to show how shrewd they are. The first player to solve the clue discards one of his cards. The goal of the game is to get rid of all the cards.<br/><br/>Why the game is so cute: <br/><br/>     easy game rules, that can be explained in 1 minute - it&rsquo;s a perfect family game;<br/>     you don&rsquo;t need a table to play the game, so you can take it wherever you want;<br/>     it is very dynamic, all the players are in the game every turn; <br/>     the game has both competitive (3+) and cooperative (2+) modes;<br/>     two difficulty levels; <br/>     the game is bilingual: the words on the cards are in the English and in the Russian languages (for the Russian edition).

Your goal is to build a commercial empire and corner the market in the resources valued by intelligent beings everywhere.<br/><br/>Empyrean, Inc. is a self-contained card game for 2 to 4 players, Ages 9 and up. All the game artwork is by Studio Foglio.<br/><br/>You begin a game of Empyrean, Inc. with a single planet under your control - your Home Planet. Each turn, that planet produces resources which you draw from three different card stacks, representing farm resources, mine resources, and factory resources. Each class contains four individual resources, like Nutragoo, Tritium, and Robots. Spend these resources to claim new planets, adding to your production in future turns. Or buy action cards that give random but powerful benefits. You can also trade resources with your fellow players.<br/><br/>Or you might want to hold onto them, because once you have three of a particular resource in your hand, you can lay them down in front of you. Once you've laid a resource down, you can add additional cards to the set as you get them. When the set contains seven cards, you've cornered that resource. Corner enough resources and you win the game!<br/><br/>You win a game of Empyrean, Inc. by being the first player to corner the market in 2, 3 or 4 different resources, depending on the number of players in the game. Cornering a resource means building a set of seven cards of that resource face up in front of you.<br/><br/>",

The riskier, more difficult pot or the safer, easier one?<br/><br/>The difficulty of each shot is calculated depending on the number of cards between the cue ball and the target pocket, whether there are any other balls in the way and the angle at which you hit the object ball. You have a Cue (upgradable) with a Power tracker as well as Chalk (needed for trickier shots). You can opt to apply extra power to reduce the shot difficulty, but both Cue Power and Chalk are limited resources that you'll need to manage. Then you roll two dice and if at least one of them scores equal or higher than the difficulty, the pot succeeds.<br/><br/>Miss a shot and there's a chance your opponent will clear the table and win.<br/><br/>",

        "description": "The Beautiful Game is a soccer replay game that simulates the highlights of a soccer match.<br/><br/>Each game played simulates goal chances of the teams during a match by using statistical team ratings and dice rolls.  The player can play a single match, or with multiple games, simulate an entire league season. Many expansion sets of additional leagues and championships are available separately.<br/><br/>The basic game is simple and short (usually under 5 minutes), only determining if goals have been scored during the match by using the two teams' attack and defense ratings, chance cards, and a die rolls to see if a goal was scored.  Additional rules add the ability to identify scoring players and the time of the goal, and noting injuries and suspensions of players.<br/><br/>From the publisher's site:<br/>The Beautiful Game has been awarded the TABLETOP GAME OF THE DECADE by Jamie Marshall's 'Sports Digest'<br/><br/>The game includes the most current English Premier League teams available at time of printing<br/><br/>Watch a football match, live or on television, enjoy the action, the mid-field struggle,the joy of victory for your team, the despair of defeat, but a few hours after the final whistle what do you remember ? I suspect mainly the dramatic bits, the goals, the great saves, the near misses, the chances scorned. So that's exactly what you get in 'The Beautiful Game', those brief moments that decided the match, for better or worse, the bits that make up your memories, the talking points, the incidents that stay with you at least until next match day.<br/><br/>'The Beautiful Game' (henceforward 'BG') is an accurate replay game, accurate in results that is, and goal scorers, but unlike most soccer replay games it requires no user-decisions (which will appeal to some but not all) and is fast to play, just four to ten minutes per match, depending on how much you want to know in terms of stats.<br/><br/>For 'BG' is a layer game, three layers in this case, the basic quick-result is layer one, add on some personality with goal scorers, times of goals, that's layer two, and get involved in some simple book-keeping by recording (generic) bookings and injuries and rewarding winning form, plus adding some 'joining up' commentary, that's layer three. Even with all three layers most matches will take no more than 6-7 minutes, unless it's a real cracker !<br/><br/>",

Axis units mostly represent army corps. These include German, Hungarian, Bulgarian and Romanian units; the latter two will eventually switch sides. The Axis player actually starts the game with more tank units, the real striking power in this game, than the Soviets. But as they&rsquo;re lost they are difficult to replace, while Soviet power just keeps surging.<br/><br/>Like Defiant Russia, Red Vengeance isn't a very large game. The 17x22-inch map fits easily on a small table. There are 140 playing pieces, and it comes in a small box that's easy to store. The game plays very quickly, concluding in about 90 minutes, with a minimum of charts and tables to consult.<br/><br/>",

        "description": "In 7 Kingdoms, players are royal agents who want to collect as many followers as possible. Whoever does this best will win the game.<br/><br/>The deck in 7 Kingdoms consists of 49 cards in seven types, with each type having seven cards in a particular number range: king (1-7), bishop (8-14), etc. up to peasant (43-49). Each number range has seven cards in it, with each being a different color and bearing a crest of that color. Each player starts with three cards in hand, and one crest card of each type is laid in a row, with one card placed face up next to each crest.<br/><br/>Each round, players take turn laying one card face up in front of them, then they resolve the cards from high to low. Whoever played the highest card places it on the opposite side of the leftmost crest card, then takes 1-4 cards from those on display next to the crests as determined by the power of the card played. Then the player with the next highest card goes, etc. Any cards unclaimed are placed to the right of played cards, then the row is filled with cards from the deck until seven cards are on display once again.<br/><br/>With each card claimed, the player can either add it to his hand (up to a maximum of three cards in hand) or place it in his scoring pile. Kings, for example, let you take any four cards on display, while generals let you take cards from three consecutive spaces, princesses let you take any two cards, and peasants let you take one of two cards from specific spaces. Thus, the low cards let you claim first, but put more restrictions on what you claim or have you claim fewer cards. The bishop scores himself, then let you place one of two bonus tokens on the leftmost crest card, reveal another bonus token, then claim one card.<br/><br/>When the deck runs out or each crest card has a bonus token, the game ends and players score any cards remaining in hand. Each card claimed is worth 1 point (except for kings, which are worth 2), and whoever has the most cards of a crest claims the bonus token on that crest, thereby earning bonus points or doubling his score.<br/><br/>",

The only ones able to face them are witches given the power of future sight, who compete for the most fame. Players take control of these witches trying to complete missions and gain the most magic stones from the Clad.<br/><br/>Each player uses a personal deck of cards which they can upgrade each time they cycle through. Each turn, draw from your deck to a hand of three cards. Play cards to maneuver your witch around the board, attack, and use other effects. The three attacks the Clad will unleash each round are always visible beforehand. Players draft for turn order, playing between each of the boss turns, so planning around where the boss will move and attack when your turn comes around becomes key. Each point of damage dealt to the Clad gets you a magic stone. After nine rounds, whoever has the most victory points from magic stones and cards in their deck wins the game.<br/><br/>",

The first player to align four of their symbol or color in a row wins the game.<br/><br/>In more detail, the bricks are effectively two cubes pushed together, with half the brick being orange and the other half blue; when an orange face shows an X, the blue face shows an O and vice versa. Each turn the active player adds one brick to the wall either vertically or horizontally, with each new brick connecting to existing bricks on at least one face and at most eight symbols in a horizontal row. If no one has won by the time that all bricks are in the wall, then on their turn players remove one brick and place it in a new location; if you knock the wall over on your turn, you lose.<br/><br/>The winning condition can be changed depending on how challenging you want the game to be: (1) Connecting four squares of your color OR four of your symbol; (2) Connecting four squares of your color AND four of your symbol; or (3) Connecting four squares of any color AND four of any symbol.<br/><br/>",

This exciting, easy-to-learn game derives its content from all six Star Wars movies, making it possible for fans of all generations to enjoy battling for control of the galaxy!&quot;<br/><br/>The pieces of the model are punched out from pre-painted plastic cards, and snapped together with interlocking tabs.  Stats for each model are summarized on the base.  Each pack came with a set of cards that were used to enhance the models.  Each pack also came with a play mat that summarized the rules and provided the play area.<br/><br/>To play the full game, each player needed a thirty card deck, and thirty build stars worth of models.  Each model has one, two or three (or more) small stars on the rear of the base.  This is the cost of the model.

Every game round is slightly different as rules change or disappear entirely.<br/><br/>Let the beautiful illustrations take you to the land of Kin and help defend the dragon's hoard.<br/><br/>",

In turn, players place a card on the table, trying to place theirs in chronological order with what's already on display. A player may, instead of adding a card, claim that the current order of cards is incorrect. In this case all cards are turned over and the correct years revealed. If the order was correct, the doubting player receives two cards and ends his turn without playing anything; if the order was incorrect, then the previous player &ndash; who had accepted the order as correct &ndash; receives three cards. The first player to rid himself of cards wins.<br/><br/>Bluffing is as least as important as knowledge in Anno Domini as most events are rather obscure or are hard to date precisely. As you might expect, Anno Domini: Fussball contains historical events related to football (i.e., soccer for those in the U.S.), and the relationship of events to dates is not necessarily obvious. Like all Anno Domini games, the Fussball edition can be played on its own or mixed with any number of other Anno Domini editions.<br/><br/>",

The architects place 22 identical pieces to try to get the best score. However at this place is Ah Puch, the god of death and destruction. Ah Puch tries to disrupt construction as much as he can.<br/><br/>On a turn, you must place one of the identical pieces which twist in three dimensions. The object is to place blocks at the third level on two sides of the structure. Any part of a piece may never rise above the third level. This makes the game feel like you are assembling a giant 3D jigsaw puzzle. The 3rd player takes on the role of Ah Puch, the destructive god. Ah Puch tries to keep the other two players from making a high score.<br/><br/>The box/game board is a large, truncated pyramid in blue with finished wooden top. The blocks are painted in slightly varying shades of deep blue.<br/><br/>Re-released in 1997 by the same publisher, winning a special Spiel des Jahres award for its appearance in that year.<br/><br/>",

If they want to escape they have to succeed in several schemes. A scheme is succesful when you bring together enough different prison contacts. But everything has to be organised in secret. The other players send you contacts who'll contribute to your scheme and they'll tell you who they are but you can't see them yet. During the game a player isn't always allowed to talk, so there is a chance you can't be told who is joining your scheme. As soon as you have gathered enough contacts one random contact will join your scheme and you'll check you succeeded or failed.<br/><br/>As long as all schemes succeed everything goes as planned, but as soon as a scheme fails the guards are getting suspicious and the person who was responsible will have to draw cards of the interrogation deck. There is a chance the guards will convince you to become a snitch. When this happens your only goal is to make sure the other players don't escape. As more schemes fail tension will build. Can you still trust the other inmates or are they lying to you?<br/><br/>When enough schemes have succeeded a gun is smuggled into the prison and you'll vote who it the one player who'll receive the gun. Is there still somebody present who you can all trust to handle the gun? As soon as the gun is handed over the owner of the gun must decide. Will he shoot somebody to make sure he won't prevent the escape? Or do you still trust everyone with the risk the snitch is still among you...<br/><br/>",

Coppone, who was jailed for carrying an unlicensed weapon, was met by a group of his men - among them was Chicago gangster Joey &quot;The Rattlesnake&quot; Ratello, chief suspect in the recent killing of Marco &quot;Machete&quot; Molino - and departed quickly in a powerful seven-passenger Lincoln Touring car.

There are scores of unique planets to explore, including the homeworlds of every alien species from Dirtside and its companion game, Battlestations Second Edition.<br/><br/>You and your friends are a team of heroes in the far future, landing your starship on mysterious planets, with adventures such as raiding, rescuing, fighting, and escaping. In each mission, your team will have an objective to cooperatively accomplish, with threats like motor gangs, natural disasters, or planetary bombardment. Each planet has its own attributes like low-gravity, lava flows, or tectonic drift. You can combine your actions to do fun things like ram a jetcar into a building (to turn the building into a crater), or try to put out a fire before it reaches your ship. Your characters start with a special ability, weapons, and an ability for your species. You gain experience over time, rank up, and can purchase equipment between missions, plus gain new abilities.<br/><br/>If you own Battlestations, your characters are already fully compatible with Dirtside, and you can transition seamlessly between Battlestations (missions in space) and Dirtside (missions on planets). What will YOU discover, Dirtside?<br/><br/>&mdash;description from the publisher<br/><br/>",

Fury is gained by attacking your opponents. Gaining Fury can allow you to take advantage of sinister &quot;Dark Nature&quot; cards, but gaining too much can eliminate you from the game.<br/><br/>This Battle Box features two 70-card faction decks: Prairie and Polar.

When this happens, a mystical flower appears. However, it will not appear to just anyone &mdash; only to the most knowledgeable mage on the island at that time. Will you be that mage?<br/><br/>Spellbloom is a tableau-building, open-drafting game during which players roll dice that are used to determine both which spells they can learn and the resources to pay for those spells.<br/><br/>In more detail, each player has six colored dice that at the start of play they roll and place on their spell book. Six random spell cards are placed on the six colored locations on the island board. On a turn, you choose a die that matches the location from which you want to learn a spell, then pay for that spell with other dice that sum to the value of the first die. If you use two dice to claim a spell, you gain two mana, which you can use on future turns to adjust a die's value or claim an unowned die on the island board; if you use three dice, you gain 3 knowledge points.<br/><br/>Each spell has a unique ability that helps players learn new spells or score additional knowledge points. You gain other bonuses by placing spells in matching locations in your spell book or by placing spells adjacent to one another to complete sigils. You start the game with two task cards that can grant endgame points if you meet their conditions, and you gain two more tasks when you complete a row of your spell book. When someone completes their tenth spell, you finish the round, then tally points.<br/><br/>",

This, the first in the &quot;Jours de Gloire&quot; series, covers three campaigns in the Danube:  Hohenlinden (1800), Austerlitz (1805), and Wagram (1809).  The map is point-to-point, with hidden units supplying fog-of-war.  As this is the first game in the series, Vae Victis recommends using the corrected and modified rules available in issue 52.<br/><br/>This issue also includes a few corrected counters for issue 40.  Also included are counters and scenarios for En Pointe Toujours II (#31), and also a campaign and new planes (Russian) for GMT's &quot;Zero!&quot;, covering the 1939 Nomonhan campaign.<br/><br/>As with all Vae Victis games, the counters need to be cut out and mounted.  The rules are entirely in French, although translations are available online.<br/><br/>",

        "description": "Radioactive Bees is a tile placing strategy game that resembles a post-apocalyptical beehive under construction. The purpose of the game is to place tiles of different shapes to earn points and prevent opponents from using their tiles to earn points for themselves.<br/><br/>During each turn, players position one of their tiles on the board, keeping within the hive&rsquo;s pattern. The tiles may be placed in any direction or position. When all the available spaces have been covered up on the board, the game continues on top of the tiles already in play.<br/><br/>Each new tile must be placed so that it covers part of at least two unique tiles from the layer below. A tile may not be used to completely cover up a tile of the same shape from the layer below.<br/><br/>No part of a new tile may be placed with a gap underneath it.<br/><br/>All tile placement options must be exhausted before starting a new layer. If a player still has a tile that fits in an unfinished layer, they must place that tile regardless of whether an opponent has started a new layer.<br/><br/>A player may not miss a turn unless none of their tiles can be placed or if they have run out of pieces. In such cases, opponents continue playing until they run out of possible moves, thus ending the round.<br/><br/>When the round has ended, players mark every uncovered bee with one ring. Players accumulate points by keeping their bees uncovered and by adding radioactive rings to their bees. The more rings a bee has, the more points it gets at the end of the game.<br/><br/>Finally, players remove all tiles from the board and start a new round. The rings that have been placed remain on the tiles for the rest of the game, even if they are covered in a subsequent round.<br/><br/>SCORING<br/>Players accumulate points in two different ways:<br/><br/>1. During each round when their bees get covered by an opponent&rsquo;s tile.<br/><br/>If one or more of your bees are blocked by an opponent's tile, the targeted bee's current point value is added immediately to your score. If players cover up their own bees, they get no points.<br/><br/>2. At the end of the game, by totalizing the value of the rings adquired on their bees.<br/><br/>END OF THE GAME<br/>The game ends when, at the end of a round, one or more bees have earned enough radioactive rings to receive radioactive markers and emerge as mutant queens.<br/><br/>The player with the most points, after the score for the final round is calculated , wins the game.<br/><br/>-description from designer<br/><br/>",

One player 'bowls' a small ball from a bowler while the other player operates the batsman. Fielders are placed throughout the board to 'catch' the ball in the base between their feet.<br/><br/>A classic and beloved family game originally released in 1977 and immensely popular in the UK, Australia, India and South Africa in particular. The game has undergone a number of changes and additions over the years, but basically layout and game play has stayed the same.<br/><br/>In some versions, the Bowler figure has a long tilting 'chute' that the ball rolls down after pushing on the bowlers arm. In others the figure is spring loaded and pressing a lever makes the figure 'throw' the ball, with a setting for fast or slow bowling. The balls themselves have changed from small metal ball bearings to two sizes/weights - for both variety in play and for easier game play for younger players.<br/>The Batsman figure in some editions has a string with which you pull back the bat to release it to hit the ball, others have a slide mechanism and some have a trigger mechanism to move the bat. <br/>The fielding player figures are a variety of colours in different versions and may be white, yellow or blue. Additionally in a couple of versions (like Super Cricket) they had magnetic bases to further help 'field' the ball.  <br/>The player figures in one version (One Day Cricket) came entirely unpainted and could be painted the colours of your favourite teams. Later editions include an actual Wicket Keeper figure rather than a 'W' shape part of the batter mechanism.<br/><br/>The playing 'field' also has changed shape and fabric. In some editions it is very thin light fabric (and in older games, the flocking on the underside completely disintegrates and moults off!) in others it is thicker, crease resistant neoprene. The boundary 'fence' is either white L shaped angled plastic flat or picket shaped strips with green joiner pieces or in more recent versions, a simple rope length.<br/><br/>In the different versions players can simulate a one-day international, a Twenty/20 series or a full five-day test match. <br/>As well as being featured on box graphics, some well known cricket players have even lent their names to some versions, like Freddie Truman, Mike Atherton, AB De Villiers &amp; Jonty Rhodes.<br/><br/>It is very difficult to date many of the earlier games accurately as there are no dates on the boxes (very annoying). The date '1977' on the included rule sheet ACTUALLY refers to the copyright date of the ORIGINAL games release by Peter Pan Playthings and NOT that particular versions release. Guesstimates can be made by the box imagery, design and playing piece inclusions.<br/><br/><br/>World Cup Cricket is touted as &quot;The original action-packed table-top cricket game!&quot; for Ages 4 and up.<br/>In the box (decorated with action shots of late 80s / early 90s players including Alec Stewart and Jack Russell) comes with a green beize (?? beige) playing area which is laid out on a table, with six boundary fence sections which Velcro around the edge to act as the boundary and prevent the ball flying off around the room. The batsman attached at one end and the bowler to the other.<br/><br/>The pitch (although octagonal) resembles an archery target -the closer to the boundary and further from the batsmen, the higher the ring value. Directly in front of the batsmen is an area worth no runs, outside of that 1 run, then a ring worth 2 runs and the outer area worth 3 runs. Hitting the fence gets 4 runs and there are four small areas jutting out of the boundary worth 6 runs.<br/><br/>The bowling player places fielders (with a catching 'cup' between their legs) around the field in an attempt to 'catch' the batsman out. Bowling is achieved by loading the ball into the bowler's cupped hand and pushing down on the front arm, causing the ball to roll down a ramp towards the batsman.<br/><br/>The batsman is controlled with cord attached to the bat. The batting player pulls back the cord, releasing it in time to hit the approaching ball. Whichever area the ball is hit to is the number of runs the player gets.<br/>Batsmen can be out by being caught by the bowler, by hitting the ball between the legs of the fielders into their 'cups', by the ball hitting the stumps behind the batsmen or by the batsman edging the ball into the &quot;wicket keeper&quot; which is attached to the batting stand.<br/><br/>There are earlier versions of the game where the batting action is different and the players less detailed.<br/><br/>",

        "description": "For some time, there had been reports that a large area of dense jungle northwest of Saigon was a staging base for the Viet Cong. Ideally situated near Cambodia, a nexus point of the Ho Chi Minh Trail, and proximal to the capital city of Saigon itself, the area that became known as the &ldquo;Iron Triangle&rdquo; allowed the Viet Cong to conduct well-organized and well-supplied operations into the very heart of South Vietnam. In the meantime, a hundred miles to the south, a US riverine force, comprised primarily of the newly-arrived 9th Infantry Division, began to penetrate into the hinterland of the Mekong Delta, and even into the overgrown rivulets where only &lsquo;Charlie&rsquo; had ever operated before.<br/><br/>In the first in the Vietnam Battles series, two games are included, Iron Triangle and Snoopy&rsquo;s Nose (named after a distinctive curve in one of the distributaries leading to the Mekong River). Both games utilize the very popular Fire &amp; Movement combat system, and is easy to play.<br/>Units in the game are typically companies and some battalions and occasional brigade equivalents. The full spectrum of the war in Vietnam in 1967 is featured with everything from riverine craft to helicopters. Each hex represents about a half mile, and each game turn represents from about a half a day to several days of operations.<br/> The game includes one map (22x34&rdquo;) and 200 counters.<br/><br/>(from the editor's website)<br/><br/>Published with Modern War #7, Sep-Oct 2013<br/><br/>",

        "description": "Bohnanza: Das W&uuml;rfelspiel is a dice game in the Bohnanza family. Instead of cards, dice give you the beans that you must use to satisfy orders and (eventually) collect &quot;Bohnentalers&quot; (i.e., dollars, bucks, dinero...). The first player to collect ten Bohnentalers wins.<br/><br/>At the start of the game, each player receives two order cards, each of which shows five orders; the player tries to complete orders on one card while using the other to cover completed orders. The easiest orders to complete &mdash; say, three beans in any combination of two types &ndash; are at the bottom of the card, and the hardest ones &mdash; requiring, say, a three-of-a-kind plus a rare bean &ndash; are at the top. Orders must be completed from bottom to top.<br/><br/>On a turn, the active player starts by rolling the five bean dice, three of which have one combination of beans and two of which have another combination. This player must set aside at least one bean, then they reroll any remaining dice, setting at least one aside, etc. After at most seven rolls, they complete as many orders as they can, reusing the dice as needed to complete orders. Once a player completes three orders, they can &quot;harvest&quot; the card for one coin. Each additional completed order is worth a coin, up to a maximum of three. When a player harvests the order card, they draw a new card and use that to record completed orders (possibly on the same turn) on the order card they already had.<br/><br/>In the Bohnanza card game, players trade cards to improve the standing of both parties involved in the trade. In W&uuml;rfel Bohnanza, the active player doesn't trade dice, but opponents do get to benefit from that player's rolls. After each roll by the active player, all other players can use the dice just rolled &mdash; and not dice already set aside &mdash; to complete orders on their own cards. Thus, the active player has some incentive not to dawdle too much as their opponents might benefit from their turn more than they do.<br/><br/>The game ends as soon as one or more players have collected ten Bohnentalers. The player with the most Bohnentalers wins!<br/><br/>Bohnanza: Das W&uuml;rfelspiel features the same gameplay as W&uuml;rfel Bohnanza, but uses fewer dice, has only five orders on a card instead of six, lowers the victory threshold, and has a few other changes.<br/><br/>",

        "description": "The clock is ticking. Your team of Investigators have been sent to R&rsquo;lyeh for the purpose of reinforcing the failing gate, trapping Cthulhu in his prison forever. The Investigators have two enemies. The clock and the cultists hidden among their numbers.<br/><br/>Triggering the four needed incantations will take all of the skill your team can muster and you don&rsquo;t have the luxury of time to search for the traitors in your midst.<br/><br/>The odds are slim, but the fate of the world rests in your hands.<br/><br/>The game is played in rounds starting with the player holding the pocket watch and proceeding clockwise so that each player takes a turn. The clock advances one hour after each round.<br/><br/>WHY IS THIS GAME DIFFERENT?<br/>- Each player will have a choice of Five actions during their turn. <br/>- The Cultists are not the main enemy, the clock is. <br/>- The Cultists don't know each other. <br/>- Revealing a Cultist does not eliminate them from the game.<br/>- Players lose sanity in different ways.<br/><br/>INVESTIGATOR/CULTIST ACTIONS<br/><br/>CONTRIBUTE: <br/>Play a card into the incantation pool.<br/><br/>RESEARCH: <br/>Discard (0-3 cards) and refill your hand to 3 cards &lt;Draw 1 Insanity Card&gt;.<br/><br/>GAMBLE: <br/>Draw 2 cards. You must play one into the incantation pool immediately. Discard the unplayed card.<br/><br/>INVESTIGATE<br/>Shuffle and look at all but 1 of the cards in the Incantation Pool. You may swap 1 card with 1 card from your hand. <br/>&lt;Draw 1 Insanity Card&gt;<br/><br/>MAKE AN ACCUSATION<br/>A player may make an accusation during their turn in order to accuse another player of being a cultist. A majority of the players must vote in agreement with the accusation for the accused to reveal their Secret Nature card. If the accused is an Investigator subtract two hours off the clock.<br/><br/>THE NECRONOMICON<br/>If time is running short and the investigators are desperate, they may vote to consult the Necronomicon. There will be advantages but failure is an instantaneous and brutal end to the game.<br/><br/>EQUIPMENT<br/>Character will each get a piece of equipment to aid them in their quest. Usage of equipment may aid the Investigators or the Cultists... it just depends whose side you are on.<br/><br/>There is no player elimination and the cultists are unaware of the other cultist's identity. If a cultist is discovered their powers are reduced and changed. Be wary, they can still wreak havoc.<br/><br/>",

Either of the two fronts (the Golan Heights and the Suez Canal) may be gamed separately, or both can be linked to simulate the course of the entire war.<br/><br/>This deluxe edition of the classic Frank Chadwick wargame goes beyond a mere reprint of the original game; it now features an updated order of battle and revised, expanded rules that fully integrate the air and air defense systems into the rest of the game, featuring a re-engineered sequence of play to provide a much more immersive experience for players. Operational planning is up to the players &ndash; you decide who to mobilize and where the hammer blow is to fall. A great solo, 2-, 3- or 4-player wargame! Some of the enhancements made in this edition include:<br/><br/><br/>     Redesigned 9/16&rdquo; counters featuring BONUS option for tank battalions (two sets of counters; one with NATO symbols and one with representative AFV side view)<br/>     Game map information is updated based on research and includes all-new map artwork<br/>     Supporting charts convey more information at a glance for ease of play<br/>     Updated the Order of Battle based on new information and analysis<br/>     Resolution converted from a d6 to d10 for all game purposes<br/>     Fully-integrated air and air defense systems; re-engineered sequence of play<br/>     Updated rules treatment backed by many illustrations, an index, and clarifications and examples of play to reduce potential questions<br/><br/><br/>&mdash;from the publisher<br/><br/>For game support of this 3rd Edition, you can post your question in the forums here, on the ConsimWorld game folder, or send an e-mail to the designer, Chris Fawcett.<br/><br/>",

If five cards are now in the shop, you must take cards.<br/><br/>When you take cards, if 1-4 cards are in the shop, take all cards of a single color from the shop and add them to your collection; if five cards are in the shop, take all cards of two colors from the shop instead. If the number of bulbs in a color in your collection is now a multiple of three (3, 6, 9, 12), score those cards, placing them face down in a corner of your playing area.

        "description": "CargoTrain is a fast-paced card game with a train theme. Deliver as much cargo to the factories as you can. Plan carefully. Invest wisely. Anticipate your opponents' moves, and deliver the most stock in the quickest way possible. And, what&rsquo;s most important, fulfill trade contracts. Let your adversaries watch the sparks fly from under the wheels of your dashing train!<br/><br/>Every turn in this game is divided into two phases. First is the planning phase, in which players plan their moves by playing move cards. Next is the action phase; this is the heart of the game. Players reveal their move cards one by one and perform actions (load cargo, deliver cargo, upgrade train, switch cargo order on the stations, pick up a new contract). There are many possibilities; players must choose wisely and plan ahead their moves. The gameboard is made from cards and players change it during the game.<br/><br/>",

Most of the core mechanisms are identical to Pax Pamir, though some have been tweaked to fit more appropriately to the Expanse setting.<br/><br/>In the game, 3-4 players act as powerful puppetmasters acting behind the scenes of the Solar System, manipulating the three main factions to their own advantage: The United Nations, the Mars Congressional Republic and the Outer Planets Alliance.  All while mysterious events are occurring due to the arrival of the extraterrestrial Protomolecule.<br/><br/>Gameplay is mostly in the form of area control.  However, each area of the board can be controlled in two different ways (often simultaneously): a faction can control a region by having the most fleets and transports there, whereas a player can control a region by having the most supporters and fleets of a faction they are loyal to present.  Four scoring phases occur throughout the course of the game, and the method of scoring is determined by whether any one of the three factions is in dominance when the scoring occurs.  If so, then players loyal to the dominant faction will score victory points.  If not, then players score victory points based on their individual power and presence on the board.<br/><br/>Players can increase their power and abilities by purchasing asset cards from a communal market using influence, the game's currency.  Each asset grants its controller particular actions and abilities, and at any particular time one of the four types of cards - Military, Subterfuge, Political or Economic - will be able to perform their actions for free based on the current political climate.<br/><br/>Players must acquire the most powerful assets, ally themselves with the ascendant factions, and make deals with other players to secure their positions on the board and score the most victory points when the scoring phases occur.  After four scoring phases, the player with the most victory points is the winner!<br/><br/>Cole Wehrle (designer of the original Pax Pamir) has indicated that he has no objection to the files for this game being shared on BGG.<br/><br/>&mdash;description from the designer<br/><br/>",

        "description": "It&rsquo;s Fairy Season! The Goblin Chiefs (the players) order their Goblin flunkies into the forest to catch Fairies across the four seasons, and shake out their Fairy dust to make a wicked winter brew! Herd Fairies into Swarms and use Goblins to trick and trap them. Lure in the mighty Royal Fairies to free their flighty Fairy friends, then catch them too! The Chief who catches the most Fairies wins.<br/><br/>Fairy Season is a trick-taking card game in which players take turns playing Fairies, Traps, Goblins and Royal Fairies in an attempt to capture the pile (called the swarm) and add it to their private stash. This is achieved when the next player in turn order cannot play a card to beat yours. At the end of the game, players count the Fairies and Royal Fairies in their stashes, with the highest score winning. There is an alternate victory condition also - any player who can capture all four Fairy Royals wins immediately!<br/><br/>&mdash;description from the publisher<br/><br/>",

Each player spends the first half of the game rushing around the board collecting supplies and weapons, fighting off the occasional looter and trying to stop your pesky neighbors from taking stuff that is rightfully yours. (At least as far as you are concerned!)<br/><br/>The second half of the game is spent trying to survive. Sure there is some good stuff around, but it certainly isn&rsquo;t plentiful and zombies are out in force, offering big points for those with the weapons to fight through, and dead ends to those who can't. Whoever has the most stuff at the end of the game wins.<br/><br/>This game is based on the same prototype as Jäger und Sammler.<br/><br/>",

        "description": "Longstreet is a miniatures wargame, depicting battles of the American Civil War. The game is based on the earlier games of the Honour series, which are Lasalle (Napoleonics) and Maurice (Horse and Musket), but there are differences. Like those two games, Longstreet also handles rather small forces of about a brigade a side.<br/><br/>The game tries to capture the feel of ACW battles by depicting the peculiarities of terrain that the battle was fought in and the characteristics of the troops used in a simple way. There is a strong emphasis on the roles of the different troop types (infantry, cavalry, and artillery). The other focus is on fatigue, as troops slowly (or not so slowly...) whither away in battle. There is a scenario generator and the game should be played using it or the Grand Campaign, which is easy to do.<br/><br/>There are guidelines for using the rules with different scales of miniatures, so everything from 6mm to 28mm can be used.<br/><br/>The game is influenced by action cards, and the fire phases and command choices of each player are partly decided and influenced by playing these action cards from that players deck. Each player has their own deck of action cards that they use during the game.<br/><br/>There is a free Lite version on the publishers homepage and a commercial full version, that can be bought. Those interested can try the free Lite version before deciding to take the plunge.<br/><br/>",

        "description": "&quot;Alexandros: Conquest and Empire&quot; is a wargame on the conquests of Alexander the Great from 334-323 B.C. <br/>One player takes command of the Macedonians and the other leads the Persians. They fight over provinces in quarterly turns. Combat can be fought tactically, using a separate display reminiscent of the way of resolving combat in Eagle games, with units assigned to various sections of the battlefield. Units which survive tactical combat can lay siege to cities.<br/><br/>The game can last varying numbers of turns, depending on the course of the war. There are several conditions, including the death of leaders and conquest of overwhelming numbers of provinces, that can end the game early. Otherwise the game ends in the summer of 323 (when Alexander actually died) or in an optional scenario, keep going up until 318 if Alexander survives that long.<br/><br/>",

Simply put, it&rsquo;s a chance to play an entire race (not just a ship or fleet) and conduct an entire war one step at a time. You&rsquo;ll colonize planets, manage resources, build ships, capture territory, and negotiate with your neighbors. The ultimate aim of a campaign can be as straightforward as galactic dominance. Although this can be achieved in other ways such as accomplishment of a set of predefined victory conditions.<br/><br/>VBAM has been designed in such a way that you can use any background setting for your campaign. The primary goal of the master book is to provide the basic structure and rules to handle campaign-level issues. The campaign guide is designed to offer the players a variety of choices in complexity and style of play. It can be played by itself as a stand alone game using our quick space and ground combat resolution system with the included source materials or used with more complex tactical combat systems with source materials that you already own.<br/><br/>Expanded by:<br/><br/>    Victory by Any Means: Campaign Moderator's Companion<br/>    Victory by Any Means: Jovian Chronicles<br/>    Victory by Any Means: The Starmada Edition<br/>    Stars Divided: Terran Civil War (Victory by Any Means: The Starmada Edition also required)<br/>    Victory by Any Means Source: Wars of the Kuissians and Boltians<br/>    Victory by Any Means: The Menagerie<br/><br/><br/>",

        "description": "Life is really busy on a college campus and the only place to really relax is the Cafeteria. This applies to everyone, except for you, since you are working students who served as waiters in the Cafeteria.<br/><br/>Each player control a waiter with its own asymmetric power, to use to overcome others. At the start of the game the objectives of the Month are revealed (for example, serve the largrest number of Hot Chocolates or the largest number of Professors).<br/><br/>During his turn the player rolls 2 coloured dice, and places them on spaces of the same colour. Special training skills allow you to re-roll the dice or turn a color in to another. Each space, based on the color, allows you to prepare specific drinks (there are 5 drinks on the menu). Once prepared, the player adds the drink to his or her tray: but beware the tray is heavy, so space is limited (some training skills allow you to unlock more space).<br/><br/>At the end of turn, the player can choose to process one (or more, if you have the specific training ability) of the orders backlog on the Game Board: you must have and discard all the drinks shown on the card, get paid the bill ($ are Victory Points) and then pick up the Order Card, and place it in front of you. Specific training skills allow you to get extra tips from particular clients and/or drinks served. Once collected the Order card, the player will be allowed to use the special training ability shown on the card: the experience is always a teacher of life.<br/><br/>At a certain point, the cafeteria closes (there are a fixed number of Orders card to be processed, according to the number of players) and the round is ended, in a way that all players has performed the same number of game turns. A this stage the 'Employee of the Month' prizes are awarded and, who has the most Victory Points ($) is declared the winner.<br/><br/>Tipologiy: entry-level Splendor-like (Dice Placement)<br/><br/><br/>La vita &egrave; veramente intensa in un campus universitario e l'unico posto per rilassarsi &egrave; la Caffetteria. Questo vale per tutti, tranne che per voi, visto che siete studenti lavoratori che servite come camerieri nella Caffetteria.<br/><br/>Ogni giocatore dispone di un Cameriere con un proprio potere asimmetrico, da sfruttare al meglio per prevalere sugli altri. Ad inizio partita vengono estratti gli Obiettivi del Mese, fra cui, ad esempio, servire il maggior numero di Cioccolate Calde oppure servire il maggior numero di Professori.<br/><br/>Durante il proprio turno il giocatore tira 2 Dadi colorati, e li colloca su spazi dello stesso colore. Particolari abilit&agrave; formazione consentono di ritirare i dadi o di trasformare un colore in un altro. Ogni spazio, in base al colore, permette di preparare specifiche bibite (vi sono 5 bibite nel men&ugrave;). Una volta preparata, il giocatore aggiunge la bibita al proprio vassoio: ma attenzione il vassoio &egrave; pesante, quindi gli spazi sono limitati (alcune abilit&agrave; formazione permettono di sbloccare pi&ugrave; spazi).<br/><br/>A fine turno il giocatore pu&ograve; scegliere di evadere uno (o pi&ugrave; di uno se ha l'apposita abilit&agrave; formazione) degli ordini inevasi presenti sul Tabellone: deve consumare tutte le bibite indicate, farsi pagare il conto (i $ sono Punti Vittoria) quindi raccogliere la carta Ordine, e piazzarla davanti a se'. Specifiche abilit&agrave; formazione consentono di ottenere mance extra da particolari clienti e/o bibite servite. Da quel momento il giocatore beneficia dell'abilit&agrave; formazione indicata sulla carta: infatti l'esperienza &egrave; sempre maestra di vita.<br/><br/>Ad un certo punto la caffetteria chiude (ci sono un numero prefissato di ordini da evadere, in base al numero di giocatori) e si completa il round, in modo che tutti abbiano eseguito lo stesso numero di turni. Quindi sono assegnati i premi Impiegato del Mese. A questo punto, chi ha pi&ugrave; Punti Vittoria ($) &egrave; dichiarato vincitore.<br/><br/>Tipologia: per tutti (Piazzamento Dadi)<br/><br/>",

This civil war opposes, in a first conflict phase, protestants- otherwise known as Huguenots- to catholics, then royalists to League members after the accession of Henri IV to the throne in 1589.<br/>The art of war during this period of the Renaissance is rapidly changing. The great feudal landlords, steeped in morals, fight alongside mercenaries motivated by sole cupidity. The diversity of the weapons that are used offers great tactical possibilities, based on impact and fire. Gendarmes, cuirassiers, reiters, harquebusiers, lansquenets and Swiss mercenaries confront each other in a merciless fight.<br/>The Fate of Reiters  is a grand tactical game which, for the first time, allows the simulation of five battles of that era :<br/>COGNAT : January 6th, 1568<br/>DORMANS : October 10th, 1575<br/>AUNEAU : November 24th, 1587<br/>VIMORY : October 26th, 1587<br/>METRIEUX (aka VIRE-CULS) December 10th, 1587<br/><br/>This is a classic game system ; &laquo; I go, You go &raquo;, of average complexity, including, during the active player's phase, a sequence of reaction from the passive player, such as fire, counter-charge or tactical backstep. The maps are with areas from 300 to 500 m by side. A color code allows to easily determine the costs of movements and the line of sight. The scale of the game is one unit for 100 to 500 soldiers or one or two guns. One game turn represent a duration of 20 to 30 minutes. A corps represents either a vanguard or a rearguard, or the main body called battle.<br/>The combats allow to simulate charges &laquo; in wall &raquo;, the merciless shocks between pikemen, the artillery fire and highlight, by a support system, the combination of iron -shock- and fire -shooting. The optional rules- caracoles, orders, lost children, looting- add even more realism to the era's battles. The rules and the five battles offered are based on a thorough bibliography and researches made into books written by contemporary authors, specifically Fran&ccedil;ois de la Noue for the Protestants and Blaise de Montluc for the Catholics, and also on precise topographical plans of each battlefield that is still accessible... Are you ready to put on the Henri de Guise, Duke of Lorraine and fight your enemies the famous German mercenaries? The Fate of Reiters is the second opus of By Shot, Shock and Faith (P3F). This new HEXASIM game offers you this option with an innovating and elegant game.<br/><br/>&mdash;description from the publisher<br/><br/>",

Players conduct an experiment each turn by rolling 3 dice, hoping for each die to be at least as high as the shared Fortune Die. Each success lets the alchemist draw a new card from the deck or play a card from hand; each failure means a discard.<br/><br/>Cards represent Innovations to improve the alchemist's laboratory, Misfortunes to make rivals' lives harder, Actions to immediately impact the game, and Reactions to respond to other alchemists' deeds.<br/><br/>When an alchemist rolls doubles in an experiment, Chaos occurs and fortunes change. The experimenter re-rolls the Fortune Die, making success easier or harder to achieve.<br/><br/>Players race to build up a laboratory sophisticated enough to turn lead into gold. The first player with 10 or more points of Innovations in the laboratory is the victor!<br/><br/>Rule clarification: A standard experiment involves rolling 3 dice (this is unclear in the Second Edition rulebook).<br/><br/>",

This is the end of the Vedic period and the rise of the 16 Mahajanapadas (Great Kingdoms). Each player takes on the role of a Mahajanapada ruler, trying to make their kingdom the most predominant power in the ancient Bharata. Players get to decide how to lead their armies, gain and manage resources, and conquer territories to expand their kingdoms. At the same time, they have to protect their territories from rivals, natural disasters, and social events, such as riots. Players&rsquo; actions and achievements are rewarded with Victory Points that contribute to determining the game winner.<br/><br/>Each player (or team) begins the game with a set of resources, two armies, and a different start location. In addition, players get to create their game avatars by choosing a combination of personality traits and abilities (variable powers), which can differ or be identical to other players&rsquo;. With each turn, players draw resources that are often linked to their previous decisions on resource pool management. Players may choose to convert their resources into Coins and use the Coins to increase their Army Strength or to conquer specific terrain types later in the game. Players use their two armies to move on the map, conquer territories through settlements or direct combat with other players, plan for attack or defence, gain regional resources and trade objects, and accomplish objectives. Events trigger natural disasters, diseases, or riots, which create an additional level of defence and resource planning. This is the time your ability traits become handy. They allow you to manoeuvre certain Events in your favour while at the same time, based on your play style, to make it harder on other players or the contrary, to help them out with their own Event scenarios.<br/><br/>In BHARATA 600 BC, players have a great level of control over their play style and outcome. They can opt-in or out of a combat strategy, an objective-based strategy, a competitive or collaborative approach. As players find themselves in a dynamic game context, they have to adapt their strategy and choices to the evolving scenarios on the board.<br/><br/>",

        "description": "Bashni is a traditional Russian game in the Checkers family.<br/><br/>The game is identical to Shashki (Russian Checkers) in the rules regarding movement, capture, and promotion, but every time a piece is captured, it is put at the bottom of the capturing piece or stack. If the captured piece is itself on a stack, only the top piece is captured, and the underlying pieces are thus &quot;liberated&quot;. This means pieces are never permanently removed, but stacks get steadily higher throughout the game.<br/><br/>According to Abstract Games magazine issue 1, the game has a revival in Russia, with tournaments being held in St. Petersburg regularly.<br/><br/>Bashni was the inspiration for Laska, Chess world champion Emanuel Lasker's stacking game, that is better known in the west.<br/><br/>",

The difference is that in Rummoli, the A-K-Q-J-10 pay cards are Spade-Hearts-Clubs-Diamonds-Spades and you collect the payouts for the pay cards during play of the Michigan phase, while in Tripoley, they are all Hearts, and Tripoley adds 'Hearts' phase to the game, where players take payouts for simply being dealt the pay cards before play of the Poker phase commences.<br/><br/>These games all derive from the card game Michigan (also known as Boodle, Stops, and Newmarket), which has only four pay cards (traditionally A Hearts-K Clubs-Q Diamonds-J Spades) and only the Michigan phase (with payouts during the play of the Michigan), and usually no pot -- instead, each play pays the winner one chip per card left in their hand.<br/><br/>",

        "description": "Designed by veteran designer Brian Train, Summer Lightning is an operational simulation of the invasion of Poland by German, Slovakian and Soviet forces in September-October 1939. The campaign was a brief, bloody, and confusing affair fought between two armies which were considered equals by many in the world.<br/><br/>Despite the interesting campaign, there aren&rsquo;t many war games on the Polish campaign, probably because the conventional wisdom is that it was a very unbalanced contest. This is informed mostly by hindsight. The German Army knew it had superior numbers and organization, but much of its equipment was no better than that fielded by the Poles, the concept of blitzkrieg had not been proven in actual combat, and they were not at all sure that the campaign would not bog down into static fighting. As it was the Germans lost over 16,000 dead in five weeks of campaigning.<br/><br/>Summer Lightning uses a proven game system that features an interactive sequence of play and near-diceless combat that both shows the historical German superiority in command and control and is flexible enough to allow players to explore many variations and options, so that the game can be as equal (or unequal) a contest as they want. Options include: variable Polish deployments; greater or lesser surprise and speed of mobilization; changed attitudes of the Soviet Union or neighbouring countries; French intervention; Plan Zachod (the Romanian Bridgehead Strategy); and even the possibility that the Blitzkrieg, so appealing in theory, fizzles out on the battlefield. Also, because so many war games are designed for two but played by one, an optional solitaire play method is included.<br/><br/>",

        "description": "Description<br/>ILLEGAL is a crazy, offbeat party game for 5 to 9 players where participants each take on the role of an illegal dealer. The game is accessible to casual as well as expert gamers, and has a mature theme. The rules of ILLEGAL are simple, but the game will challenge your skills in negotiation, misdirection, discretion, charisma, and persuasion. The more you play, the more you will learn to expand and master these skills. Each game lasts about half an hour, and is packed with intense exchanges, interactions and a lot of humour.<br/><br/>Launch into this risqu&eacute; adventure! Dare to become one of these offbeat dealers and get a good laugh with your friends.<br/><br/>How to Play<br/><br/>ILLEGAL is played in two phases:<br/><br/>During the first phase, each player receives a deck of cards prepared by the Game Master (GM). These decks assign each player his dealer role and gives him a good quantity of the corresponding resources. Each player's deck also specifies his buyer role, and he will make every effort during the game to get as many resources as possible of the type he is interested in. These roles are kept secret until the end of the game.<br/><br/>Players leave the table and split up into continually changing pairs or groups to negotiate and exchange some of their resources, away from prying eyes. Every three minutes, they return to the table to collect new resources at the docks (from the GM). Then they go again for another three minutes of secret dealing.<br/><br/>The second phase, called the Tribunal phase, starts once the players have returned to the table and the GM has run out of resources.<br/><br/>At the tribunal, players play the roles of jury members, witnesses, suspects and judges! They openly discuss their suspicions concerning the secret roles assigned to every other player. The GM reveals the suspect cards in pairs representing the dealer and buyer roles assigned to the various players. For each card pair, players have one minute to debate. After one minute, a simultaneous vote is cast, and a suspect is formally accused.<br/><br/>Scoring<br/><br/>At the end of the game, each player reveals his role pair and acquired resources. He scores one victory point for each resource acquired corresponding to his buyer role, one point for each suspect card accusing him wrongly, thus rewarding him for his skills in misdirection and discretion, but he loses 5 points for each suspect card accurately accusing him, representing 5 years spent in prison. It is very easy to end the game with a 10-year jail sentence if you are insufficiently discreet or are too greedy!<br/><br/>",

You impersonate Wizards whose task will be to summon one of Fantastic Creatures as soon as possible. Each player receives a special Portal board that consists of 9 fields. Each field contains 2 runes that must be powered with Magic Power in order that a proper element of a Fantastic Creature could appear there. These elements are represented by special cards managed by players.<br/><br/>The course of the game is divided into turns. During each turn players, in rotation, perform one of the actions: acquire Magic Power to activate runes (with spell dice), manage Fantastic Creature element cards, or use the assistance of the Magic Helper (provided they are in possession of one). At the end of their turn, if both runes are active (powered with Magic Power) on any of their Portal's fields, players can summon there their due Fantastic Creature element.<br/>Players must be careful though, as gaining too much Magic Power and/or too many Fantastic Creature elements may result in obtaining the Dark Power token. If they collect too many of such tokens, they will have to purge themselves of Dark Power while losing their turn.<br/><br/>Over the course of the game players will be awarded with points from the audience. At the end of the tournament Magic Jury lead by Archmage will evaluate their proficiency in the art of magic by giving them additional points. The Wizard who will obtain the highest total score will win and receive the title of the Arcanimus.<br/><br/>&mdash;description from the publisher<br/><br/>",

        "description": "Ayu is a unification game for two players: Black and White. It is played on the intersections (points) of an odd-sized square grid (board). The recommended board sizes are between 9&times;9 and 15&times;15. At the start of the game, black and white stones are arranged on the board in an interspersed pattern (see images).<br/><br/>\t\t\t\t<br/>\t\t\t\t<br/>\t\t\t\t\tDefinitionsA group is a stone along with all stones one can reach from it through a series of steps onto orthogonally adjacent stones of its color.<br/><br/>\t\t\t\t<br/>\t\t\t\t<br/>\t\t\t\t\tPlayBlack plays first, then turns alternate. On your turn, make note of the empty points orthogonally adjacent to one of your groups and move a stone in that group to one of those points. All stones that were part of the same group before the move must be part of the same group after the move.<br/><br/>Your move must reduce the distance between the affected group and its closest friendly group. The distance between two groups is the shortest free path between them along the lines of the board, i.e. the number of consecutive moves you would need to merge those groups. The path does not need to be a straight line.<br/><br/>If you cannot make a move on your turn, you win. This occurs when you have only one group or there is no free path between any of your groups. If a board position is repeated with the same player to move, the game ends in a draw. This is possible in theory, but probably requires colluding players.<br/><br/>The pie rule can be used in order to make the game fair. This rule gives White the option, on their first turn only, to swap sides with Black instead of making a regular move.<br/><br/>\t\t\t\t<br/>\t\t\t\t<br/>\t\t\t\t\tNotesTry to build long walls between enemy groups to force your opponent to spend more moves connecting them. Playing from the outside in is usually more efficient, as it helps you not to leave any groups behind. The distance rule has some interesting tactical effects: sometimes, in order to move a group (A) in the desired direction, you will first have to move away its closest counterpart (B) so that A is not &quot;engaged&quot; to B anymore.<br/><br/>&quot;Ayu&quot; is short for &quot;Attach Your Units&quot;.<br/><br/>",

You must first fill the double chickenfoot with the 8 tiles that go around it. If you can't fill you must draw a new tile, it is like Uno in this aspect.  Once the chickenfoot is played you may play a new domino, either putting a number against a number or playing a double tile in a T arrangement across another domino, this becomes a new chickenfoot and must be filled before continuing, a player draws a tile if they can't finish the Chickenfoot.  The round ends when one player has no tile, or there are no tiles left to play on a chickenfoot.<br/><br/>A fun game that can be played by gamers and non-gamers alike.<br/><br/>",

And YES : they ARE scared.<br/><br/>In Hellton Palace, both players are managing a hotel, hiring bellhops to address their guest needs. But in the end, they know the place is going to collapse at some point... Try to outlast your opponent!<br/><br/>An unsatisfied customer would penalize your reputation, but a too enthusiastic legendary creature or god can literally break the pillars supporting the building!<br/><br/>Twist your habit by having a new goal: Losing last!<br/><br/>On your turn: <br/>1) Welcome a guest in one of the available rooms in the matching row.<br/><br/>2) Dismiss your bellhops by flipping their tile to their &quot;break&quot; side.<br/><br/>3) Hire new ones by paying the cost with your hard-earned money.<br/><br/>4) Move your Bellhop pawn from room #1 to #9. When they reach an empty room, ignore it and move on to the next one. When they reach an occupied room, choose whether to serve the Guest or not.<br/>Serving a Guest removes their irritation token and makes them satisfied, which allows you to apply the effects on their door hanger <br/>If you decide not to serve the Guest, place an Irritation token on them except if they have one already. In this case, remove it with a Bell token. In this case, remove all irritation token and lose one bell token.<br/><br/>5) Choose between collecting coins (of all satisfied guests/all guests without irritation token) OR gaining a Bell token back.<br/>There are two ways of ending the game:<br/><br/>     A player has no bell token left <br/>     A player has a column with no pillar token left<br/><br/><br/>&mdash;description from the publisher<br/><br/>",

The game depicts this conflict at a strategic level, with most operational and tactical details represented by fast and easy-to-play systems. The intent of the game is to provide a broad overview of the historical events while being fun to play.  Grand Fleet owes its original inspiration to Avalon Hill's War At Sea.  The game borrows a number of concepts from this earlier game as a starting point, such as area movement, individual capital ships, battle line resolutions, and rolling sixes to hit, and then diverges significantly to reflect the World War One situation.<br/><br/>",

After the exodus from Earth, you fight on a distant desert planet for scarce resources, build extractors, factories and units - from fast construction vehicles to frightening Paloozas.<br/><br/>Get knee-deep into intergalactic warfare: Choose your companions with their set of game-breaking skills, build your deck out of unique strategy cards and outsmart your enemy: Win by either destroying their headquarter or by sending their most valuable units to the scrapyard as quickly as possible.<br/><br/>Each player chooses a faction first. Every faction consists of four companions - the General, who oversees the battlefield from the planetary orbit, the Commander, who draws on many years of experience in combat and adjusts tactics rapidly, the Tech, who supports the troops by steady innovations and the Trickster who is outsmarting the enemy. Each companion comes with a unique deck of action and war cards. Players can either use these predefined decks or, if they are advanced, engage in deckbuilding in search of ever unique combos.<br/><br/>The same high variability applies to the map: Here you can either use a predefined casual variant for a quick match or build a world before the game starts by drafting planetary cards. We are already designing and playtesting new factions, companions and decks as well as worlds.<br/><br/>In this action-packed game, you'll have very little time to secure your basic supplies - that is, build the first construction vehicles and build the first extractors to harvest materials and energy - before clashing with your opponent on the tight map.<br/><br/>Play action cards during your turn to gain unique strategic advantages and take the initiative on the battlefield. Gather your tanks, carefully plan the use of your war cards, which will give you powerful bonuses in battle - and declare the war zone you want to attack. But beware, here comes the big twist: the battle in the war zone you declare will not take place directly at the end of your turn, but at the end of the turn of your opponent. Your enemies have a whole turn to react, to redeploy troops or to suddenly stab you in the back somewhere else. So be one hundred percent sure before you act!<br/><br/>&mdash;description from the publisher<br/><br/>",

        "description": "A Game of Staging Ridiculous Interventions about Nonsensical Problems.<br/><br/>Caring friends and family have all gathered &ldquo;because they LOVE you&rdquo;. That&rsquo;s how it always starts. That&rsquo;s when you suddenly realize there&rsquo;s a problem - and it&rsquo;s YOU. You&rsquo;re shocked and clueless, which is why your loved ones have taken it upon themselves to carefully broach the subject. Naturally, no one wants to just come right out and say it. So they keep hinting at it, hoping you&rsquo;ll catch on eventually. But will you? Or will this Intervention fail?<br/><br/>In this game, players take turns being the focus of an intervention by drawing a Problem card with a nonsensical problem like, &quot;Uncontrollable Interpretive Dancing&quot; or &quot;Neurotic Inability to Turn Right&quot;. They can't see the card, but all the Concerned Friends and Family can. Friends will give obscure clues that hint at the problem, without giving it away. The sooner the Intervened can guess the problem, the more points they'll score. The longer the Concerned Friends keep them guessing, the more points the Friends can earn. Each of the three rounds have a unique format for giving clues, Broaching the Subject, The Emotional Appeal and Offering a Solution. But if the Intervened cannot guess their problem by the end of the third round, no one will score any points, having failed to help their friend.<br/><br/>&mdash;description from the publisher<br/><br/>",

At the Conclave, the supreme overseer of all magic will be appointed. The power and honor of the great lords&rsquo; houses is at stake if they do not achieve enough influence over the different Magic types through alliances with the three Brotherhoods. Fellow mages, sharpen your tongues as the Conclave is about to commence!<br/><br/>Play in tabletopia <a target='_blank' href=\"https://tabletopia.com/games/conclave-2020\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer noopener\">https://tabletopia.com/games/conclave-2020</a><br/><br/>During the game you will send Emissaries to the Conclave to gain control of at least one Magic at the end of the game. To do so, you will have to attract followers to your Influence Zone. But beware: at the end of the game the followers that belong to a Magic you do not control will be disappointed, and will work to your disadvantage. In Conclave, the player with the least Resentment Points at the end of the game is the winner.<br/><br/>The Main mechanism of the game is send a card (an emissary) from your hand to an empty space of the Conclave. Then the player will get followers if the sum of the influence of the cards in the  row of the emissary is 10 or more , the Mages with the same color or the same Brotherhood of the emissary will abandon the Conclave to join the area of followers of the player . The check to get followers also is done in the column where the emissary was placed. The emisary will remain in the conclave as a Mage.<br/><br/>&mdash;description from the designer<br/><br/>.<br/>Best Card Game by Carta Mundi - Premio Archimede 2018<br/>Winner Ciudad de Granollers Contest 2018 <br/>..<br/>Los Emisarios de los grandes se&ntilde;ores del reino se dirigen a la reuni&oacute;n de hechiceros m&aacute;s importante de todos los tiempos.

Set the game up by randomly placing fish tiles into the seas, with more valuable fish placed closer to the island (different colored tile backs). Each player starts with a fishing rod and 5 Curo (Cat Euro). The game starts in Spring; play through till Winter.<br/><br/>Each season, players first use their 2 workers (3 in some circumstances) to choose actions from a common board, in turn order. Then, in turn order, execute any of your actions (removing worker from board). The actions allow you to move your cat from the island to other sea hexes, buy/sell fish, buy special cards that improve your ability to move or fish or give you new abilities, move obstacles around the board, etc. Each player may only store 2 fish (until additional storage purchased), and different types of fish fetch different prices depending on the season. At the end of Spring, you replenish fish on the board. At the end of Winter, pay a &quot;Union Fee&quot;.<br/><br/>The game ends after the 5th Winter. The player with the most money wins!<br/><br/>",

Three weeks of savage fighting would finally see the island secured, as places like Death Valley, Hell&rsquo;s Pocket and Purple Heart Ridge entered the U.S. Marine Corps&rsquo; lexicon. The campaign saw the largest tank battle of the Pacific war, and also its largest banzai charge as almost the entire Japanese garrison (and much of the island&rsquo;s Japanese civilian population) chose death over surrender.<br/><br/>Panzer Grenadier: Saipan 1944 is a complete boxed game in the Panzer Grenadier series based on these fearsome battles. Designer Jay Townsend has provided 40 scenarios. There are four new mapboards by artist Guy Riessen showing the jungles, hills, beaches and cane fields of Saipan. And 495 playing pieces: 330 superb die-cut counter combat units and 165 die-cut markers.<br/><br/>The U.S. Marines have awesome firepower &ndash; every third man wields an automatic rifle &ndash; and bring tanks, flamethrowers and heavy artillery to the battlefield. The U.S. Army is present, along with the Imperial Japanese Army and the Imperial Navy&rsquo;s elite Special Naval Landing Forces.<br/><br/>",

        "description": "Billed as the Official Game of the United States Auto Club this is one of Avalon Hill's early Sports Illustrated branded games. The game was created by Jim Barnes who sold the game at a booth that he set up at Indy and other race track promenades in the 1970s. Mr. Barnes struck a deal with Avalon Hill and the game was changed a little by the development team at AH and published with the SI logo on the box.  On an oval track you can run up to 33 cars. Each car has its own driver card derived from the performance of the actual drivers of the featured Indy race. Ongais, Foyt, Unser, Sneva, Mears, Rutherford etc, every driver that was in the that year's Indy has a card with a color photo on one side and game racing charts on the other side.  One Card set, for an even year Indy race from 1978 through 1986, was included in the box with the other card sets offered through the AH mail order program.<br/><br/>Each driver card has 6 tables on the back. Three of the tables for movement, you chose whether you are going to drive normally, charge or back off and then roll 2 dice, referencing the appropriate table. The result will tell you how far you can move or if you have encountered car trouble. There are 2 trouble tables that can slow you down or knock you out of the race. There is also a pit stop table which controls how many turns you must sit in the pits before re-entering the race.<br/><br/>The game is driven on Stats and can be played solitaire.<br/><br/>",

Players play on the side of the board that rotates to meet them each round. At the beginning of the game, client cards are drawn and placed in front of each ticket booth in sets of three. In each round, all players simultaneously choose and play one of their carrossel cards, numbered from 1 to 12, and one of their carrossel tiles that come in twelve tiles of four different colors/types, plus two wild tiles. The carrossel tiles are simultaneously placed on the spaces indicated by the carrossel cards. Players are looking to get three carrossel tiles in a row that match the three corresponding client cards. Whenever they achieve this, they place client stand-ups on each of them to show that those tickets have been sold and give the cards to the respective players who earned them (the owners of the carrossel tiles).<br/>While it is possible to complete a sequence with only your own tiles, most sequences will be completed by using tiles from other players. Making sure you get more points out each sequence than any other player is a strong path to victory. Also there are 4 variable endgame objectives that will score additional points to those who complete them.<br/><br/>The game ends when either one player cannot perform a legal play or the client deck runs out. The player with the most total victory points (clients + objectives) wins.<br/><br/>",

These cards are full of quotes both from history and from famous Napoleonic movies: &ldquo;By God, sir, I have lost my leg. &ndash; By God, sir, so you have.&rdquo; or &ldquo;We shall match them with our lancers!&rdquo; Nobody can resist reading these with the right accent&hellip;<br/><br/>The challenge You win the game by destroying half the total combat strength of the enemy army. This task is easier for the French when only one army faces them. However, if Wellington&rsquo;s forces survive long enough for the Prussians to finally arrive, the tip of the scale will swing in favour of the Allies, and the French are probably going to find themselves fighting for their life. And nobody can be sure exactly when the Prussians are going to appear in the East&hellip;<br/><br/>",

The pirate ship crews are determined to find out who is the best captain amongst the pirates.<br/><br/>Glory Islands features easy-to-learn rules and fast, simple turns! You must outwit your opponents to claim fame and fortune. It has two different game boards and also includes a mini-expansion in the main game box.<br/><br/>Glory Islands is played over a series of rounds in which players simultaneously play sailing cards from their hands. The card values define the turn order, how far ships can move on the board, and where a player&rsquo;s pirates may be placed on the board. Depending on where they are placed, pirates may receive glory, treasure tokens, or barrels. The cards may also provide bonus actions that players can use to gain an advantage over their opponents. When pirates occupy all of the spaces on an island, the player with the most pirates on that island will gain the most glory.<br/><br/>The game is over when one or more pirate ships have completed the route around the islands. The player with the most glory is crowned the &quot;King of the Pirates&quot;!<br/><br/>",

        "description": "Fabula (previously known as Grimm) is a story-telling game where players must fill in parts of a story. One of them is the teller, who read (or imagine) the beginning of a short tale &mdash; his/her current draft. Each other player incarnates a tentative hero (a gnome, a princess, a little boy, etc.) who tries to be the main character of the teller's tale. 3 times during the game, the teller asks the other players how they think things happened at that time of the story. They must choose an item depicted on one of the cards laying at the center of the table and use it to continue the story. Depending on how convincing they are to the teller, and how well they integrated their character and the item to the current twist, they get points in the shape of &quot;quill&quot; markers. Each item can only be used once by any player, who keeps it afterwards, and who puts his/her markers on top of the card.<br/><br/>At the end of the three turns, the two players with the most quill markers are selected to compete in the epilogue. The teller reads (or makes up) an idea of an ending to the story. Now, each finalist in turn has 30 seconds to present a relevant proposal for including his character and both items figured on the two remaining cards on the table into the ending. (A sand timer is included.) Both players have to use the same two objects, but the second one speaking cannot use them in the same way than the first (more or less compensating the fact he had more time to prepare his part).<br/><br/>Eventually, the teller decides which of the two finalists wins, depending on the relevance of their proposals.<br/><br/>The game comes with two proposed variants :<br/>- &quot;Experienced players&quot; : all the players tell the same tale, each one adding an element to the same storyline and bound to continue using the plot of the former speakers.<br/>- &quot;Collective&quot; : there are no quill markers and appraisal given by the teller. Every player takes part in the epilogue, and there's no winner.<br/><br/>",

As sorcerers of the mystical art of Word Weaving, you and several other treasure hunters will descend into the Tomb of the Forgotten Consonant and quest for the Syllabus of the Lost Syllable. When the journey is complete, only the most heroic word smith will walk away with the win.<br/><br/>Dungeon Scroll is a word game where players spell words (cast spells) to meet specific word challenges (dungeon encounters)to score points (gain gold).<br/><br/>A layered dungeon of 9 cards is formed by randomly selecting cards from the Entrance (x1), 1st Floor (x3), 2nd Floor(x3), Dungeon Boss(x1) and Final Room (x1) dungeon cards and combining them into a face down stack. Each turn the top card will be flipped (starting with the Entrance) and players will face the specific encounter on the card. Thematically it could be anything from a Skeleton or Pit Trap to a Travelling Merchant.<br/><br/>Players each have a hand of letter cards from which they will spell words with different points values (letters are worth varying points and some cards provide multiplication bonuses). If the encounter is a &quot;combat&quot; encounter, typically the player that can play the highest point word will win the encounter and claim the highest gold reward on the dungeon card, with other players claiming the second and third reward - however that is not always true as each dungeon challenge provides twists and turns; to the sorts of words that can be played. Other &quot;Special&quot; encounters might allow such actions as players to sell their letter cards for gold.<br/><br/>The player with the most gold at the end of the game wins.<br/><br/>",

This tri-lingual (English, Spanish, French) crowded MB box contains a whole bunch of thin cardboard 3D buildings; stand up cardboard pieces for the 12 humans and the helicopter, and a bunch of plastic miniatures of the dinosaurs (a T-Rex and some Velociraptors). This is played in teams, the human team trying to get 3 humans off the board via the chopper, and the dinosaur team trying to prevent this. When 3 play, the third player alternates teams.<br/><br/>The humans can jump between building roofs or can run between them. Unfortunately, the dinosaurs move a lot faster on the ground than the humans (the humans move between marked spaces, the dinosaurs between zones). Buildings have several entry/exit points for the humans but only one for the raptors. Dice indicate how to move humans and dinosaurs; one of the dice has Stop/Go markings which control whether you may roll again or not --making movement harder to predict. Jumping (for humans) and entering buildings (for dinosaurs) is also dice controlled. The T-Rex is confined to a single board edge area; its function is to flush the humans from the starting building -- once he reaches it, all remaining humans are devoured!<br/><br/>Yes, unlike the first movie game, in this one there is death aplenty. As soon as a dinosaur enters a space with humans in it, even when just passing through, they're all eaten. Tastes like chicken.<br/><br/>An alternate game consists of two plays, with teams switching allegiance. The winning team is then the one that saves the most humans.<br/><br/>From the same film series:<br/><br/>    Jurassic Park Game<br/>    Jurassic Park III: Island Survival Game<br/><br/><br/>",

Laser range-finders, thermal sights, radar-seeking missiles, and counter battery radar all add to the accelerated pace which is the trademark of modern combat. Combined Arms has been designed to portray the machines, the speed, and the confusion of the modern battlefield within a playable miniatures rules system.<br/><br/>Based on the popular Command Decision rules for World War II miniatures wargaming, Combined Arms balances realism and accuracy with playability to produce a game that not only plays quickly, but also is fun to play. Combined Arms is designed for play at the operational level of combat and is played in real time. A premium is placed on command, and the game is designed to reflect the need for command control over a battlefield which is rapidly changing. Decisions need to be made quickly and accurately, or you can lose control of the battle.<br/><br/>Combined Arms is a complete rules set to get you started in modern miniatures wargaming. It is designed to be played with either 1:285 micro-armor or larger (up to HO) scale miniatures. The basic rules present a comprehensive framework for ground combat in the modern era.

        "description": "Manage a football club and lead it to victory.<br/>- FootClub is a card game with a tactical dimension in which you control everything: recruitment during the transfer window, team lineup, pre-match strategy and coaching during the game.<br/>- Footclub offers a total immersion into the football experience, including the thrill and emotions of a real football match!<br/>- 2 game modes available. Pee Wee mode (15 min): simple, accessible for all, perfect to discover the game, it will easily attract beginners as well as young players. Expert mode (60 min): strategically rich and with great replay value, it will satisfy experienced players.<br/><br/>The aim is to play a football match and to win the game, by scoring at least one more goal than your opponent. Each player builds its own team during the transfer window using a drafting mechanism.<br/>During the pre-game, each player chooses the lineup of its team (the team's layout on the field) and makes, at the same time, tactical choices to decide how the team will play. In order to do so, each player builds a deck with 14 cards selected among the 42 cards available (such as, for example, 4 tackles, 2 counter-attacks, etc.).<br/>The match is divided into two halves. A half consists of 5 rounds. Each round takes several steps: <br/>- draw, <br/>- substitutions, <br/>- ball possession (each team plays cards alternatively to recover the ball),<br/>- offensive (the team that possesses the ball tries to score a goal), <br/>The first half ends when the players can no longer draw cards. Each player then builds a new 14-card deck to start the second half.<br/>The game ends when the second half is over. The team that scored the most goals wins. A match can also ends up in a draw, a tie between the two players. In such a case and in order to determinate a winner, the players can agree to continue the game by going into extra time and, if necessary, a penalty shoot-out.<br/>Prior to starting the match, the players can decide to have a two-leg home and away confrontation.<br/><br/>Major part of the game is deckbuilding and playing cards.<br/><br/>This game includes the following components: 50 team cards; 84 match cards; 2 Kop cards; 8 help cards; 24 score cards; 70 tokens; 1 Pee Wee rulebook; 1 Expert rulebook; 2 six-sided dice; 1 multi colored dice; Dimensions of the box 9.1 x 6.6 x 1.2 inches (230x168x35mm); Dimensions of the cards 3.1 x 2.4 inches (88x63mm).<br/><br/>",

At the beginning of a round, each player gets a character. This character consists of 1 nationality, 1 drink and 1 localization and, inevitably, 1 gesture and 1 word he has to pronounce when they clink glasses. The cards &ldquo;aperitif&rdquo; are mixed and posed face hidden in the center of the table. They consist also of 3 characteristics, but are mixed this time (f.e. a German drinks champagne in front of Big Ben). The active player turns over a card &ldquo;aperitif&rdquo;. It is necessary to look at it well if one of your characteristics is on the card which has been just turned over; you will have to make the gesture associated with the drink and to pronounce the word associated with the nationality of that character. Inevitably, it is the fastest player who will win the card. <br/>The game ends when all &ldquo;aperitif&rdquo; cards have been played.<br/><br/>Home Page: <a target='_blank' href=\"http://www.guillaumegames.com/Jeux/TchinTchin/TchinTchinAccueil.htm\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer noopener\">http://www.guillaumegames.com/Jeux/TchinTchin/TchinTchinAccu...</a><br/><br/>",

The one who attempts to cover his own secret data, at the same time, try to hack the true unrevealed data of other players as much as possible.<br/><br/>In the game there are 2 type of Code Card.<br/>1. Alphabet Code = A,B,C,D,E,F (one of each)<br/>2. Number Coed = 0-9 (one of each)<br/><br/>At the start of the game all players will receive 3 Codes which consist of 1 Alphabet Code card and 2 Number cards and that's your code which you have to protect it.<br/><br/>The goal of the game is be the last one in the game, whose code cards cannot be revealed.<br/><br/>On your turn you start to declare what you are not by picking 'Data Card'. (Data card is the card which tell everyone that 'This' is not mine. For example I pick Data Card 'A-B'. That means I am telling everyone that my code is not A or B for sure)<br/><br/>After I  pick 'Data Card', then I send 'Hack Card' to ask someone &quot;is it correct?&quot; (Hack Card is the card that have a question. there're several kind of them. For example &quot;Do you have 0,4,7 or not?)<br/><br/>After that, others do the same thing. Play for 4 rounds and then say the answer of who you want to decode.<br/><br/>If you're correct that player out of the game.<br/>If you're wrong, you have to reveal one of your codes.<br/><br/>The last one who can protect the codes is the winner.<br/><br/>-description from designer<br/><br/>",

Some candies are worth one point, others two points, and some of them let us play an additional tile.<br/><br/>The game starts with a wall of candy tiles on the table, all of them placed randomly. Players receive three tiles, and they play one per turn, placing it on the table and taking as many tiles as pieces of candy that have been completed. The tiles don't have to match every single side, so if we place a tile touching three others but only matching two of the sides, we take those two tiles and leave the rest. We keep aside the tiles that we get from the table as they are our points. The tile that we played stays on the table, and we receive a new one at the end of our turn so that we always have three from which to choose. Whoever gets the most candies wins!<br/><br/>",

A player reaches a planet by earning 12 movement points toward that planet.  The game is played in a series of rounds until someone wins.<br/><br/>In each round, players are dealt 6 &quot;ship&quot; cards (which are 1 of 4 colors, or suits, numbered from 1-4).  They simultaneously pass 2 cards to each other. Players then simultaneously play 1 card at one of the 3 planets, until all 6 cards are played (and they must play them so 2 cards are at each planet).<br/><br/>Players score &quot;movement&quot; points in 1 of 3 ways.  (1) When placing a ship card, players score a movement point if the ship card color matches the icon on top of their movement card (which is used to keep track of the movement points, so this icon color keeps changing).<br/><br/>(2) By having the best 2-card hand at a planet. Using typical poker-like ranks, players compare hands and the best hand earns 2 movement points.<br/><br/>(3) Each card, in addition to having a suit and a number, has an arrow that can be oriented to point left or right (by rotating the card).  The player earns a bonus movement if the arrow color matches the color of cards played in the adjacent column.<br/><br/>The game is very portable, consisting of only 25 cards.<br/><br/>For 1-player, there is a mechanism for competing against a dummy player.<br/><br/>-description from designer<br/><br/>",

He, at least, understands me&mdash;and has sense enough to leave me alone when I am in my dark moods.<br/><br/>I have decided to start a kind of diary; it may enable me to record some of the thoughts and feelings that I cannot express to anyone; but, beyond this, I am anxious to make some record of the strange things that I have heard and seen, during many years of loneliness, in this weird old building.<br/><br/>For a couple of centuries, this house has had a reputation, a bad one, and, until I bought it, for more than eighty years no one had lived here; consequently, I got the old place at a ridiculously low figure.<br/><br/>I am not superstitious; but I have ceased to deny that things happen in this old house&mdash;things that I cannot explain; and, therefore, I must needs ease my mind, by writing down an account of them, to the best of my ability; though, should this, my diary, ever be read when I am gone, the readers will<br/>but shake their heads, and be the more convinced that I was mad.&quot;<br/><br/>The House on the Borderland<br/>The Plain of Silence<br/>- William Hope Hodgson*<br/><br/>Game Objective<br/>In an ancient house, a Recluse, his dog Pepper and his sister Mary must survive while exploring its mysteries, and penning a diary until the Luminous Speck appears. Solitaire game only.<br/><br/>Gameplay<br/>A single player decides the actions of a Reclusive old man, his dog Pepper, and the Recluse&rsquo;s sister Mary. Each turn is divided into 2 to 4 phases. An untold number of turns will be played. The game will end when the Luminous Speck Noise Tile is drawn. The game can end earlier if all characters are killed on the map. If reaching the Luminous Speck, the player has won well if Recluse is alive with all characters, having written an entire diary, and discovered the mysteries of the house. Characters lost, an incomplete manuscript, and unknown mysteries are less than well.<br/><br/><br/>    Based on the book by William Hope Hodgson, House on the Borderland was published in 1908. It was among the first supernatural tales of what would be considered Cosmic Horror. <br/><br/><br/>",

As soon as you launch a tiny secret project, hordes of fighters in party-colored tights come out of nowhere and dismantle it into small screws. How unfair!<br/><br/>Now everything is different. The former 'guardians of mankind' have quarreled into pieces, squabbled, and perished into thin air. Good riddance! The horizon is clear, so my time has come! The time of a genius, merciless, and of course unbelievably vile supervillain &mdash; actually, at this point, just a villain because there are stupid, spineless, and cowardly other villains who also seek world domination. It's time to put an end to this. This morning I have finally realized that. This galaxy shall be mine!<br/><br/>Supervillain: This Galaxy Is Mine! is an intense card-based strategy game of galactic domination inspired by all sci-fi worlds put together and fueled with frenzied humor. Each player becomes a villain, and you have to overcome other villains and conquer the galaxy! To do this, you use two universal card decks &mdash; the domination deck and the minion deck &mdash; and in each deck, each card may be used in multiple ways.<br/><br/>You may launch a domination card as an asteroid at another villain. The asteroid would disrupt their plans and possibly kill their minions &mdash; and if you charge your asteroid (using minion ops), it can blow up everything! Or you may take a domination card as a project to build. Every project has a minor ability. Upon completion, the project transforms into a secret facility and its major ability comes into effect, providing you with new tactical opportunities.<br/><br/>You also command millions of loyal minions who are not too smart &mdash; but they are devoted and diligent! You can use a minion card in two ways: You may put a minion card on your project as a minion mob to build it, or you can discard it as minion ops to perform a special operation. For instance, you may shoot down or charge an asteroid, destroy a mob or a project, increase the building capabilities of your mobs, and so on.<br/><br/>Secret facilities bring you domination points, and a villain who acquires five domination points immediately becomes the supervillain and is proclaimed &quot;Emperor of the Galaxy&quot;, winning the game as well.<br/><br/>Team play is possible, and with two copies of the game up to six players can compete at the same time.<br/><br/>",

The soccer player names are quite hard to say because the author deliberately invented really strange and long names.<br/><br/>To win you have to put the ball in the net more times than other team.<br/><br/>The game is noisy and hilarious. Each coach gets an action card. Each player get a &quot;number&quot; that represent the t-shirt number of the figures they will control (more than one there are less than 14 players).<br/><br/>Only the coach see the action card and have to call BY NAME (of soccer players not of the people playing the game) to indicate where to move to without talking, without indicating the wooden soccer players. The only way to communicate is to give him indications with his hands or miming something as real coach do.<br/><br/>Every time a wooden soccer player is in the right position the coach scream &quot;PASS IT&quot; and so on the other wooden soccer player until the last is positioned and the coach screams &quot;SHOOOOOT!!!&quot;&quot;<br/><br/>All the players stop play. If the team is positioned exactly as the action card requires, the last player who moved a wooden soccer player for the team throws a die to score a goal.<br/><br/>Some penalties are given to the coach for performing forbidden actions (like calling wooden soccer players by number or indicating it by pointing) and if the action card is not correctly reproduced.<br/><br/>RETHEMED : HysteriCoach Hockey<br/><br/>",

        "description": "From DecisionGames.com<br/><br/>Angola Raiders<br/><br/>During the Cold War a ruthless conflict was waged on the Angolan border between the South African Defense Force and communist insurgents. Border War is a solitaire game that puts you in the middle of that fighting as commander of a South African battlegroup based on the frontier. You conduct raids into Angolan territory, seize enemy base camps and, just as important, return to home base.<br/><br/>The game includes two decks of cards. The Mission Cards provide scenario objectives and the resources with which battlegroups are assembled. The missions are drawn from historic cross-border raids, such as Operations Protea and Modular. You recruit from a variety of unit types, including recon, commandos, mechanized infantry, paratroopers, G-5 long-range artillery, and air support.<br/><br/>Border War is part of the Commando mini-game series. Once a battlegroup is organized, you move it across the border. When a force enters certain points an Event Card is picked. Events can include anything from special intelligence information to the appearance of major enemy forces. There&rsquo;s a range of foes, from SWAPO insurgents and Angolan government regulars to powerful Cuban armored formations. Combat is resolved via a quasi-tactical procedure in which both tactical superiority and firepower play their parts. There are special rules for helicopter reaction forces, PSYOP, and leaders.<br/><br/>",

Each player holds a hand of eight white answer cards at the beginning of each round, and passes a card (sometimes more) to the round boss, face-down, representing their answer to the question on the card. The round boss determines which answer card(s) are funniest in the context of the fill-in-the-blank card. The player who submitted the chosen card(s) is given the question card to represent a point, and then the player to the left of the Round Boss becomes the new Boss for the next round. Play continues until the players agree to stop, or until they are thrown out of the pub, at which point the player with the most Points is the winner.<br/><br/>Kampf gegen das B&uuml;nzlitum is a Swiss adaption of the popular Cards against Humanity. It features all new cards with Swiss celebrities, places and topics of interest.<br/><br/>",

American forces from off-map transports assault the beach. Those units not swamped during the approach attempt to move up the beach toward the German-occupied bluffs, clearing obstacles as they advance.   Some units (tanks, sharpshooters, bazookas) execute ranged fire at fortified German units.  Naval Forward Observers guide ship-to-shore fire support.   The Player&rsquo;s assault force faces German defensive fire (solitaire, system-controlled) from machine guns and anti-tank emplacements, panzerfaust and rifle fire, as well as off-map German artillery.  When the bluffs are reached, American units must clear the trenches by assault. The game tension is visceral as your brave Joes are pinned down or hit by the intense German fire. You&rsquo;ll grit your teeth as a Combat Engineer team deploys Bangalore torpedoes to clear obstacles while under fire, and cheer when a German unit is taken out by a tank or by a ship&rsquo;s guns directed by one of your forward observers. How many sections of German trench will your men be able to clear in the twelve, heart-pounding game turns? Will you be a private or a colonel at the end of the game?

        "description": "For centuries, the renowned Paradox University educated the best masters of time ever. This year, after the retirement of Master O'Clock, there is only one vacancy to occupy and our seniors will face a final exam in which they will have to prove who is the Master of Time.<br/><br/>The challenge facing our students is known as Test of paradoxes. Each student is sent to a different moment in time and access to a time machine, so they can send travelers to their peers&rsquo; moment. But watch out, if the traveler finds himself in the same timeline a temporary paradox will occur and the thin fabric of time will be ripped apart. Create paradoxes on your piers&rsquo; timelines, avoid them in yours. Reveal yourself as a great Master of Time in Paradox University and relieve Master O'Clock.<br/><br/>&mdash;description from the publisher<br/><br/>",

The player who wins a trick receives a score chip with a mythical creature depicted upon it (Phoenix, Pegasus or Hydra). At the end of each round, these chips count points. However, if you take the last chip of a species of creature, all score chips of this creature type must be returned at the end of the game.

The sacrifices are scattered on the altar and the king is demanding a reading.<br/><br/>It&rsquo;s time to make a future for yourself.<br/><br/>OBJECT<br/>Manipulate the Bird Sacrifice Tiles (referred to as &ldquo;BS Tiles&rdquo;) into lines of 3 with a shared attribute, called Portents, to collect Omen Tokens from the outside of the Altar. Use Portents to make sets of Omens with a common attribute called Fortunes. Create one Fortune of 4 Omens or two Fortunes of 3 Omens to win!<br/><br/>TURN SEQUENCE<br/>Each turn has two phases: Sleight of Hand and then Scrying.<br/><br/>In the Sleight of Hand phase, the active player manipulates the arrangement and composition of the BS Tiles on the Altar.<br/><br/>In the Scrying Phase the active player performs upkeep on the Altar and collects Omens for their Fortunes.<br/><br/>SLEIGHT OF HAND<br/>There are 3 steps in the Sleight of Hand Phase. It represents waving one&rsquo;s hands over the altar with occult flair. Improvised incantations are encouraged.<br/><br/>1. Push<br/>The active player may push 1, 2, or 3 tiles off the Altar from a single side. These BS tiles may be pushed in any arrangement as long as they move in the same direction from the same side.<br/><br/>2. Replace<br/>After tiles are pushed off of the Altar, the active player fills the empty spaces on the Altar with new tiles from their hand. They may place their tiles freely in the empty spaces.<br/><br/>3. Palm<br/>All the tiles that the active player Pushed off of the Altar enter their hand for the next turn.<br/><br/>SCRYING<br/>This phase combines scoring and upkeep. There may be up to 4 steps depending on the game state. They are performed in the order below.<br/><br/>1. Check for New Portents<br/>The active player checks the Altar for any new Portents. If any are present on the Altar proceed to step 2. If not, skip to step 4.<br/><br/>2. Collect Omens<br/>If any of the new Portents on the Altar are in a line with an Omen Token, the player immediately collects the Omen(s).<br/><br/>3. Ignite New Burnt Offerings<br/>For each new Portent on the Altar, the player chooses a tile to turn into a Burnt Offering and flips it over to its lit side. Every new Portent requires a new Burnt Offering of its own.<br/><br/>4. Snuff Old Burnt Offerings<br/>If any Burnt Offerings were on the Altar during the Sleight of Hand phase, check if they are still a part of a Portent. If they are no longer a part of any Portent, flipping the Burnt Offering tile to its unlit side. If flipping a Burnt Offering over would create a new Portent, it stays lit.<br/><br/>",

Once all the pieces have been claimed, the players &mdash; starting with the last one to take a piece and reversing the playing order &mdash; take turns placing their pieces on the game board one by one.

Any lace can be moved by either player, but it must be moved the exact number of spaces rolled, then threaded through an empty hole. When you're unable to complete your turn, you lose. And so, the goal is to maneuver the laces to limit your opponent's options &mdash; but should they escape, they might just hand your crafty trap back to you.<br/><br/>This is a simple, strange, and sprightly little game that takes only a minute to learn. There's something soothing about the sound of the shoelace sliding against the board as you pull it through. And there's something gently nerve-wracking as the holes get fewer and fewer and the laces start to get shorter and shorter. Each match results in a unique and visually appealing crisscross of blue and pink laces. Every lace has a knot carefully tied at one end by hand &mdash; by either designer Amabel Holland, publisher Mary Holland, or one of our friends.<br/><br/>&mdash;description from the publisher<br/><br/>",

Everything is going so fast!<br/><br/>Safari Splash! is a game for 2-6 players of ages 8+, that plays in just 90 seconds. At the beginning of the game each player gets a reminder card and a scoring card (there are 4 different levels of scoring, of increasing complexity). The 120 safari cards are randomized and placed face down in a disorganized pile, within the reach of all players.<br/><br/>The scoring card serves as the starting point of each player's river, and also depicts the preferred (and maybe disliked) animal(s) for the player. The game is played in real time (it counts with an app support) and players will be taking face down cards from the safari pile, flipping them over, and adding them to their river. The deal is that each safari card back depicts 3 animals, but only 2 of them are present on the card front. So players need to select the safari cards carefully, and then place them in their area so that they form a continuous river.<br/><br/>When a player takes and flips a card containing a whirlpool, they shout &quot;SPLASH!&quot; and each player gives the safari card they're holding to the player to their left.<br/><br/>Once the time is up, players verify the integrity of their river, and then count points according to their scoring card. The player with the most points makes a big splash and wins the game!<br/><br/>Safari Splash! has different sets of victory conditions so it is playable by a wide range of ages.<br/><br/>&mdash;description from the publisher<br/><br/>",

Italian belligerence also closed the Mediterranean to Allied merchant ships and endangered British supply routes along the coast of East Africa, the Gulf of Aden, Red Sea and the Suez Canal. Egypt, the Suez Canal, French Somaliland and British Somaliland were also vulnerable to invasion, but the Comando Supremo (Italian General Staff) had planned for a war after 1942.<br/><br/>Hostilities began on 13 June 1940, with an Italian air raid on the base of 1 Squadron Southern Rhodesian Air Force (237 (Rhodesia) Squadron RAF) at Wajir in the East Africa Protectorate (Kenya). In August 1940, the protectorate of British Somaliland was occupied by Italian forces and absorbed into Italian East Africa. This occupation lasted around six months. By early 1941, Italian forces had been largely pushed back from Kenya and Sudan. On 6 April 1941, Addis Ababa was occupied by the 11th (African) Division, which received the surrender of the city. The remnants of the Italian forces in the AOI surrendered after the Battle of Gondar in November 1941, except for groups that fought an Italian guerrilla war in Ethiopia against the British until the Armistice of Cassibile (3 September 1943) ended hostilities between Italy and the Allies.<br/><br/>The rules use the basic The Europa Series system as a framework, with specialized rules covering the historical situation in detail.<br/><br/>Originally published by 3W (World Wide Wargames) in Strategy &amp; Tactics magazine #128<br/><br/>Game Scale:<br/>Turn: half a month<br/>Hex: 32 miles / 51 kilometers<br/>Units: Battalion to Division<br/><br/>Game Inventory:<br/>One 22 x 34&quot; 5 color mapsheet<br/>One dual-side printed countersheet (200 1/2&quot; counters)<br/>One 24-page Africa Orientale rules booklet<br/><br/>Complexity: Medium<br/>Solitaire Suitability: Medium<br/>Players: 1 or more<br/>Playing Time: 4-6 Hours<br/><br/>Players will need to provide one 6-sided die<br/><br/>",

        "description": "(from Legion Wargames website)<br/><br/>The Battle of Blenheim is a tactical level two player game covering one of the pivotal battles during the War of Spanish Succession. One player takes the role of Marlborough, commanding the British and Allied forces, and the other of Tallard, leading the Franco-Bavarians.  At Blenheim Marlborough found himself confronting a superior Franco-Bavarian force in a strong defensive position. Like Hannibal's great victory at Cannae, Blenheim was won by the successful implementation of a bold and imaginative plan. The flanks of the Franco-Bavarian forces were pinned by furious attacks at unfavourable odds which denuded their centre of troops re-deployed to buttress the hard-pressed wings. Then Marlborough released his cavalry to smash what was left of Franco-Bavarian centre and cleave Tallard's army into two. The threat that Louis XIV's France would come to dominate Europe was over.<br/><br/>The Seven Hex System (SHS) derives its name from the map which is divided into areas comprised of seven hexes which enables the player to adopt various positions within an area to reflect different tactical formations thereby making it more likely that an attack will succeed or defending units will stand firm.   The SHS incorporates several unique features intended to replicate in a simple and intuitive way the options available to a commander (the wargamer) of a large army.  So whilst the commander has complete freedom to devise a plan, and a good deal when positioning units which have yet to encounter the enemy, once battle is joined the options become increasingly limited and unforeseen events can play a part in determining the outcome of events but the commander can still influence these at a tactical level. The key to success is a sound plan with a margin for error which allows for ill-fortune, the shrewd deployment of units so as to be able to implement that plan, and the timely commitment of reserves.<br/><br/>Contents:<br/><br/>    22&quot; x 34&quot; Game Map<br/>    176 - EasyPunch 6/10&quot; Counters<br/>    16 pages Game Rules<br/>    3 Charts Player Aids<br/><br/><br/>",

        "description": "Fox's Party is a fast playing push your luck and memory game in one. Each player starts with a deck of twelve face-down cards, each card shows one of seven animals on it, but since those cards are face-down you don't know which animals you have, at least not at first.<br/><br/>The remaining cards are placed face up in the center of the table so that everyone can see the critter on the top card; the face of each card also shows a &quot;size chart&quot; of how the animals relate to one another in size: the ant is the smallest, followed by the snail, the frog, the hedgehog, the fox, the deer and the bear.<br/><br/>On a turn, you state whether you think the card on top your deck features an animal that's larger, smaller, or the same size as the animal on top of the deck, then you reveal that card.<br/><br/>If you're wrong, you place the card face down on the bottom of your deck and end your turn.<br/><br/>If you're correct, you can stop or decide to take another guess, but this time you'll compare the hidden animal on top of your deck with the animal that you just revealed.<br/><br/>Anytime you're wrong, you bury all revealed cards in the same order face down under your deck. But if you stop after one or more correct answers, you then place all of those cards (in the order guessed) on top of the central deck.<br/><br/>The first player to play all the cards in his deck wins.<br/><br/>",

Taking the role of cute mastermind pets players are locked in a nuclear war to the death. The goal is to craft missiles using set collection and devastate opponents with various combinations to be the last player standing.<br/><br/>The party-style game features classic 'gotcha' style game mechanics and encourages players to form social alliances, be deceitful and to back-stab one another. Cards in the game feature various hand illustrated rocket parts which combine to create missiles of varying damage levels.<br/><br/>Players target one another with rockets constructed from the parts that they have drawn, stolen from other players or salvaged from the discard pile. Once the rockets are launched, players bargain for their lives and try to convince others why they should be spared. with several special cards which allow players to disrupt trades, change life totals and to redirect damage, Pet Evil is a party game with a constant chaotic struggle for victory.<br/><br/>&mdash;description from the publisher<br/><br/>",

Through strategic movement, well-timed attacks and clever use of each factions' unique abilities, one army will conquer the Battleground, and reign victorious.<br/><br/>This compact strategy battle game is deceptively simple, with remarkable strategic depth. The combat is packed with decisive choices, action point management, area control, press your luck, and sometimes a bit of puzzle-solving.<br/><br/>The Token Terrors miniatures themselves, are also durable, inexpensive, dice-sized mini-monsters with a ton of character, that make great MTG token creature representations or RPG minions.<br/><br/>See you on the Battleground!<br/><br/>",

With your health represented by two dice, you can choose to lower your guard to deliver a heavy blow and replace a low-value combat die with a high-value health die, or you can play defensively and replace a high-value combat die with a low-value health die.<br/><br/>Be careful, though, because if any of your health die reach 0, you lose that die permanently, reducing your options later on.

In Fantasy Warriors there's much more to battle than launching your army in a head on attack - discover the perils and rewards of scouting, boasts, omens, threats and, of course, magic.<br/><br/>Each player controls an army, headed by a war chief who issues orders to the troops under his command.  Giving the right orders and changing them when the moment is right is the essence of generalship in Fantasy Warriors.  How well will you do in the battle of wits between opposing players?<br/><br/>You can play the game with forces of any size, from small skirmishes of 20 to 40 figures a side to epic clashes between several armies, containing hundreds of figures.  Battles may be fought between two players, each with an army, or groups of players forming tabletop alliances.  You don't need any sort of referee or games master.<br/><br/>There's no book keeping in Fantasy Warriors and, after you have decided on your forces, there's no need for pencil and paper.  Once the battle is under way, the colourful counters supplied with the game will give you all the information you need.<br/><br/>From the back of the box:<br/><br/>Fantasy Warriors is a complete game set for playing exciting fantasy wargames with finely detailed Grenadier miniatures - all you need to provide is a table and the desire to enjoy yourself.

        "description": "Achroma is a beautifully illustrated card game for 2-6 players. It&rsquo;s fast, fun, easy to pick up and has lots of tactical depth. Achroma is set in The Five Realms and reveals more of a overarching narrative that players can influence by using the Achroma app when they play.<br/><br/>During a game of Achroma, you&rsquo;ll spend shards &ndash; your life energy &ndash; to deploy and attack with heroic Characters, equip them with Objects of Power, harness Locations and unleash cunning Actions. Doing so will enable you to gain, drain and steal shards in return. There are two ways to win a game - get to 30 shards, or drain the other players to 0. &lsquo;Light side&rsquo; Chroma decks lean to gaining shards, and &lsquo;dark side&rsquo; Achrom decks lean to draining and stealing shards from other players.<br/><br/>Each Achroma release is a jumping on point for fresh players and an expansion for existing players. Each themed release is built around a narrative set in The Five Realms and comes with new cards to collect, trade, and play with, along with new factions, abilities, and keywords. Each release is supported by short stories, soundtracks and Achroma app updates.<br/><br/>",

        "description": "In Botanists, players tend a small area of land to grow flowers, which they then hope to sell. As botanists, each of the players has three small plots of land dedicated to growing the most popular flowers among their usual clients. However, all players obtain the seeds to those flowers from the same supplier, and because not all flowers are equally popular, the supplier only sells the seeds in bundles, on top of that, other botanists might attempt to snatch certain seeds away from under your nose!<br/><br/>Players take turns in acquiring flowers from the flower market. To do so, they may first move and then play a card that determines what &quot;bundle&quot; they are buying.<br/><br/>With each purchase, players will acquire seeds they are not looking for, so players are required to keep an eye out for open orders to make sure they make the best out of each turn.<br/><br/>Alternatively, players may choose to tend their marginal land (not so fertile), in which case they won't be able to buy new seeds, but instead will be able to trigger a bonus action. In doing so however, players will end up with withered flowers, which will generate negative points at the end of the game.<br/><br/>At the end of their turn, players check the open orders and if they are able to fulfill any of them, they not only earn bonus points, but also get rid of potential negative points.<br/><br/>&mdash;description from publisher<br/><br/>",

The game is to divide the treasury between the players and when the treasury is empty, the winner is the player who has more coins in her hands.<br/>In the beginning, the cards are drawn in front of players and the player with King starts the game.<br/>The starting player shuffles the cards and places all 6 cards from the back on the table. In all games from 3 to 6 players every 6 character cards should be placed on the table and every player has a card. So in 3, 4 or 5 player game, there are 3, 2 or one card which is not owned by any player but they have their spot in the game.<br/>Before the start, every player can see one card except the one she owns.<br/>Then the game starts!<br/>Every player can do 3 things on her turn:<br/><br/>     Rotate the cards: by saying &ldquo;to right&rdquo; every card goes to the spot in its right. By saying &ldquo;to left&rdquo; we do the same to the left. And by saying &ldquo;to the counter card&rdquo; every card goes to the spot in the counterpoint (which means the 3rd card from the left or the right).<br/>     Pay a coin to the treasure and see her card.<br/>     Claim a character and act!<br/><br/><br/>Character Acts:<br/>King: Says &ldquo;Who is the minister?&rdquo; and takes 3 coins from the treasury. Then another player can claim he is the Minister, say &ldquo;Yes Sir&rdquo; and take one coin.<br/>Thief: Takes one coin from the player in his right and one from his left. If any of them is out of coin, takes from the treasury instead.<br/>Minister: He can take any 2 cards and shuffle them under the table without seeing them and place them back.<br/>Executioner: He attempts to kill one player by calling his character card. The victim should check his card. If executioner was right, takes all the victim&rsquo;s coins.<br/>Sheriff: Says &ldquo;Pay Tax&rdquo; and all players should pay one coin to the treasury. As sheriff doesn&rsquo;t pay tax, chooses one player and says &ldquo;You pay 2&rdquo; and that player should pay 2 coins. If you are out of coins, you shouldn&rsquo;t pay tax.<br/>Peasant: She can show her card and say &ldquo;I&rsquo;m Peasant&rdquo;. Then she should say the character of all players and take all the coins remaining in the treasure. If she gets wrong, she should pay 2 coins to the treasury and the game continues.<br/>When a player claims a character, another player can challenge her. In this case player 1 gives her card to player 2 and He checks the card. If player 1 was right, player 2 should pay one coin to the treasury. If he was wrong, the game continues.<br/>Whenever the treasury got empty, the game is over and player who has more coin than others is the Winner!<br/><br/>",

Each turn you choose one of the following actions:<br/><br/><br/>        Catch: Draw two cards from the deck or pool.<br/>        Raise: Exchange cards with the pool, crabs for crabs.<br/>        Trade: Exchange cards with the pool, points for points.<br/>        Upgrade: Discard cards to upgrade gear level.<br/>        Tie Crabs: Discard cards to gain a score card.<br/>        Relax: Untap up to three score cards.<br/>    <br/><br/><br/>At the end of your turn, you can choose to trade score cards for a single objective card, then you must discard down to eight cards. When a player has gathered 25 or more VP, the game continues until all players have had the same number of turns, then the game ends and whoever has the most VP wins!<br/><br/>(Note that some versions of Crabs! carry a minimum player count of three, whereas others have a minimum p.c. of two, but the rules for the game seem to be the same across all versions.)<br/><br/>",

Some dice results provide movement, while others allow you mark rows or columns and drop new gems onto the board.<br/><br/>Once the turn order, a.k.a. the Pecking Order, has been established, players will then execute actions one at a time. Players can move their chickens 1-3 spaces depending on the dice spent and possibly shove an opponent's hen out of the way. If a chicken lands on a Grain Gem, a player can place it on their Egg Board. Some Grain Gems are rarer than others. They score positive points if they are part of completed sets on the facet of the jeweled egg and negative points if that facet is incomplete or the gem is unused.<br/><br/>The advanced variant of Gem Hens adds Power Clucks, powerful abilities for your chickens that make the battle for precious Grain Gems even more chaotic.<br/><br/>-description from publisher<br/><br/>",

On your turn, players pull the top card from a deck to reveal the board's action as well as the options they may take. The top portion of the card typically advances the color of one of the robots towards the PJ Masks base - the bottom portion gives players two options. These options are either to move one of the PJ Masks a number of spaces to fend off the robots, or to deal a hit point to Romeo's lab. Players must strategize which PJ Mask to move and when. If any robot makes it to the base, Romeo wins and the players lose. Otherwise, if the players manage to get the Lab down to 0 energy, the players win.<br/><br/>",

You might make good money with hotels, but first bridges must be built so that tourists, artists and business people of all kinds can flock to the islands. Plantations and cigar factories can show lush profits as well. Adventurers are attracted out to sea, where they dive for sunken shipwrecks and treasures. But the bottom line in Key West is that wanting everything is never a good goal.  Don't get bogged down; stay cool and plan your actions like a pro.<br/><br/>Key West is set in the 1930s and depicts the economic development of the Florida Keys. Players build hotels, maintain fruit plantations, buy cigar factories (both producing and selling), ensure that bridges are built, and search the deeps for treasure and wrecks. It features an original and surprising auction mechanism from Martin Schlegel.<br/><br/>The game is divided into two parts: first bidding, then actions.  At the beginning of each of the eight rounds, there is a offers phase, in which players bid to secure Key West cards, which represent, for example, ownership of bridges and plantations and other benefits for the subsequent actions round. Individual actions are a finite and players will need to approach them tactically.  It often won't be possible to do everything one wants and what not to do an agonizing decision.<br/><br/>Both experienced players and families will find something to like in Key West. There are seven different paths for generating victory points, but those who try to get involved everywhere won't succeed. The focus should be on three or four programs. In the next game one can try a different set.  As there are thus many combinations, the intentions is that matters stay fresh for many re-playings.<br/><br/>An Essen 2010 game.

Points are added or subtracted depending on whether the bid is made. Each trick is worth a point. Winning the 5&hearts; or 3&spades; is worth +5 or -3, respectively.<br/><br/>The game has been around for at least 40 years and it is often believed that it has its origins in the Ukrainian culture, possibly being brought over by immigrants to Canada. The Pagat database and newer research indicate that it was introduced in the 1920s or 1930s and is a version of the traditional card-games Three-spot and Troika, but was re-named with the influence of the card game Joffre that was originally called &quot;Shoo le Kaiser&quot;.<br/><br/>Re-implementation of:<br/><br/>     Joffre<br/>     Lost Heir<br/><br/><br/>(Kaiser has absolutely no connection with the ancient Swiss card game called Kaiserspiel or Kaiserjass.)<br/><br/>",

Each Gladiator has a value of attack according to the class of the target.

Other aspects of the combat environment, as the presence of other gladiators allies or enemies, the support of the crowd will also provide bonuses or penalties to resolve your fight. In Jugula, no dice: to resolve the battle, each player will play one of his cards in hand or will pick one to use the dice on this card. With the added bonus / malus, the show will be provided and the crowd contented!<br/><br/>The purpose: staging the opponent defeat. Each lanista aligns 4 fighters in the arena. You will be declared the winner if you have: <br/>- knocked out  two opponent gladiators on 4, <br/>or <br/>-  wounded 4 opponent gladiators, <br/>or <br/>- knocked out one opponent gladiator and wounded two others.<br/><br/>All your fight results, your gladiators&rsquo; improvements, your ludus&rsquo;s performance will be recorded on a ludus sheet -  your ultimate goal, to be the first ludus with 10 Glory Points.

        "description": "Lucha Wars is a two to eight-player dice game, based on the popular world of professional Mexican wrestling, or &quot;Lucha Libre&quot; (a.k.a. free fighting). The game is a new variation with new content to Luchador! Mexican Wrestling dice. <br/>Each player selects a Luchador wrestling character to play and rolls their Grapple Dice to try to either reduce their opponent/s life points to zero to win by a knock-out (KO) or hold the opponent down on the mat for a &quot;count of three&quot; to win by a pin.<br/>Each wrestler has individual Life levels, Pinnable level, and Combo Attack zones. Also, they each have their own Special Attacks that can be used during a match by rolling their Special Attack Die.<br/><br/>Players begin by each rolling their own set of five 'wrestling dice' at the same time, trying to ensure that they land in, or touching the wrestling ring. The results of HITs, DODGES, and MISS rolled are played off against each other with DODGES being re-rolled once which can also be used to target their opponent/s dice. The player with the highest Hits is the winner for that round and the loser takes the difference in damage off their Life track.<br/><br/>Additionally, the winner records the victory by moving their counter up one tile on their Special Attack Track. <br/>The Special Attack track allows a player to do their Special Attack, attempt to PIN an opponent, attack using the Combo Die and attack with a Weapon (Weapons Match).<br/><br/>If a player has reached the PIN tile on their Special Attack Track, the 'three count' begins against their opponent. The player being pinned has three attempts to save, using four of their five wrestling dice or lose the match.<br/><br/>In a tag-team match, players have the choice of trying to tag-out to regain slight strength, but it can also cost them... if they fail to tag and get dragged back into the ring by their eager opponent.<br/><br/>In the Weapons match, four Weapons Tokens are placed face-down in each of the four corners of the wrestling ring. Once a player moves their token to the tile on their Special Attack Track that shows a Weapon, it allows them to take a random Weapon Token and use that Weapon against an opponent at the beginning of any new round. This will often involve dexterity rolls with dice.<br/><br/>The Ladder match is a two-player game about which player gets their wrestler standee to the top of the ladder first to win the match. The game also includes a Changing Alliances match and Cage Match rules.<br/><br/>&mdash;description from the designer<br/><br/>",

Your base of operations is the USS Franklin D. Roosevelt on duty at Yankee Station. You play as a Navy pilot flying strike missions against targets in North Vietnam. Your goal will be to survive a mission or a campaign.<br/><br/>The Skyhawk was a nimble aircraft and was capable of carrying slightly over four tons of<br/>ordnance. Depending on your target, the player has the opportunity to load out his aircraft to meet the mission requirements. The missions will not be easy. President Johnson and his civilian advisors may even change your target or ordnance loading depending upon the political situation in the USA.<br/><br/>Facing you will be a determined North Vietnamese force. It is possible you will face small arms fire, AAA, SAM launches, and a rare encounter with a MiG.  You will have help. Support Forces allow the player to attack NV defense forces before you attack your target. Their success could make your job easier.<br/><br/>The player may fly a single mission or play one of the three campaigns included in the game. These campaigns are:<br/>First Tour of Duty: Yankee Station: 10 August 1966 &ndash; 10 September 1966<br/>Second Tour of Duty: Yankee Station 20 October 1966 &ndash; 27 December 1966<br/>The third campaign combines the two campaigns above with additional rules.<br/><br/>The game is not meant to be a detailed simulation of the Rolling Thunder campaign. It is a simple yet engaging, quick game for the player.

        "description": "Decisive Victory 1918 - Vol. I Soissons <br/><br/>Game scale<br/>Unit size: Regiment/Division<br/>Game Turn: 6 Hour Day/ 12 Hour Night<br/>Map Scale: 1 Kilometer per hex<br/><br/>Whatever you do, you lose a lot of men &ndash; General Mangin, commander French 10 Army.<br/><br/>The Battle of Soissons, 18 July to 28 July, 1918, is little known today, particularly in the English-speaking world. It is significant for a number of reasons; it was the first time that the French army used a large-scale attack with tanks supported by a surprise (i.e. not pre-registered) artillery bombardment, similar to the British attack the previous year at Cambrai, and it was the first time that full-size US divisions went on the offensive incorporated in the French army. But most importantly, it was the opening of the Second Battle of the Marne. It  was not known at the time, although suspected by many, that this battle was the death-knell of the German army.<br/><br/>French 10 Army, reinforced by US troops, had been assembled to strike the over-stretched German forces on one side of the Soissons &ndash; Ch&acirc;teau Thierry &ndash; Reims salient. The French had sixteen infantry divisions, including two US corps-sized divisions, as well as over three hundred tanks. The Germans facing them consisted of ten divisions, the quality of which varied widely although all had taken a battering during the Spring Offensive fighting. The German positions had been reached a few weeks previously during the final thrust of the offensives and therefore there had been no time to extensively fortify it; thus the battle was far more mobile than most of those previously on the Western Front. In addition, German artillery was sparse at the start of the battle because all of the heavy &amp; super-heavy artillery in the area had been sent north for the planned Hagen Offensive in Flanders, giving the French a roughly 2.5:1 advantage in artillery. Although the battle continued beyond when the game ends, it was largely over by the 23 July, progress after that day being very slow, which is why the simulation terminates on that day. The German defence at Soissons was skilfully executed, particularly as the attack had been a complete surprise.<br/><br/>Decisive Victory 1918 is a series of three games that when combined will cover the entire Allied offensive in July of 1918 know as the Second Battle of the Marne.<br/><br/>This simulation illustrates the main features of late WWI combat. If the campaigns of 1918 were a far cry from the static trench warfare which had characterized the previous years, defense still retained absolute tactical advantage over the offense. Even with the element of complete surprise and greater numbers of troops and equipment facing a tired enemy, the French army was unable to maintain the pace of the advance attained on the first two days. This was not through any lack of competent commanders: not only could the defender always bring in reinforcements in men and equipment faster than the attacker, but the attacker&rsquo;s speed, maneuverability, and ability to operate autonomously were still limited. It was very difficult, after the enemy's frontline was breached, to maintain any prolonged advance once the troops had progressed beyond friendly artillery cover and outpaced their logistical services. In addition, a few resolute defenders huddled around a handful of machine guns could inflict grievous casualties and delay vastly superior numbers. To adequately reflect these key aspects of late WWI warfare, the design incorporates elements and mechanisms that depart from the more standard hex &amp; counter systems.<br/><br/>The game features mandatory attacks into multiple hexes, very rigid ZOC, and severe restrictions on disengagement and advance after combat. &ldquo;Threat zones&rdquo; extend beyond the standard 1-hex ZOCs and represent limited knowledge of the enemy&rsquo;s positions, thus preventing unrealistic infiltration through narrow gaps in the frontline.<br/><br/>The Combat system is highly attritional, in terms of casualties and cohesion disruption. Reorganization is a slow process, conducted under the cover of the night. Attacking units rapidly deplete their offensive power. Defending units, on the other hand, are never completely eliminated, and retain (as &ldquo;remnants&rdquo;) indefinite residual defensive power. Defensive initiative superiority also translates into special &ldquo;fall back&rdquo; movement, which allows defenders to extricate themselves from dangerously outflanked positions and avoid encirclement.<br/><br/>Moreover, the system emphasizes the need for proper coordination and preparation in order to launch a successful assault: Artillery support, effective command control, and a fundamental factor, most neglected in the vast majority of wargames, time, to draw battle plans, register artillery coordinates, conduct adequate reconnaissance and rest and resupply the troops. Accordingly, the system requires assaults to be prepared one turn in advance. Improvised, &ldquo;on the move&rdquo;, attacks are also possible, but are likely to be ineffectual unless facing negligible resistance.<br/><br/>The Entente player will have to make the best out of his initial breakthrough, and be careful not to exhaust its offensive power too soon in order to retain some impetus for when German reinforcements move in to consolidate the frontline. Judicious use of his unwieldy and short-lived, but powerful armored assets is critical to the success of the offensive. The German player will have to conduct a methodical retreat, knowing when and where to give ground to preserve his forces and when and where to make a dogged stand.<br/><br/>The game, playable in one sitting, has a low counter density and is highly suitable for solitaire play.<br/><br/>Volume One: Soissons -  is a stand alone game that covers the French 10th army sector.<br/><br/>Volume Two: Chateau Thierry-  is a stand alone game that covers the French 6th army sector.<br/><br/>Volume Three: TBD - is an add-on game (with the previous two) that covers the Eastern half of the offensive.<br/><br/>",

Flex your financial muscles as the New York Moneybags. Bunt and steal your way to victory as the Sioux City Small Ballers. Deliver take-out slides and headhunting pitches as the Detroit Dirt Bags.<br/><br/>Bat Flip is a fast-paced card game of action and reaction. Step into the role of manager, decide how to deploy your players to hit, pitch and field over the course of an action-packed 3-inning game. Respond instantly to your opponent's moves. Utilize your best players and abilities in the most pivotal moments of the game. When the time is just right, swing for the fences and flip that bat.<br/><br/>Similar to the popular game Smash Up, you will draft two team-decks and shuffle them together to form a 24-card deck that combines both teams' players and special abilities.<br/><br/>The game alternates between the At-Bat Step and the Steal Step. During the At-Bat Step, managers will play player cards out of their hand in an attempt to hit safely or draw a walk. In response, the defending manager may play a defender out of their hand in an attempt to mitigate the damage or record an out. When players hit or walk, their cards move around the bases. During the Steal Step, the batting team may attempt to use their Runners' speed to take extra bases and the defense may, again, respond with a defender in attempt to throw the runner out.<br/><br/>Whichever team has the most runs after 3 innings, is the winner!<br/><br/>",

On the Road uses the same game play as Spot it!, a simple pattern recognition game in which players try to find an image shown on two cards, but includes a new twist.<br/><br/>Each card in Spot it! On the Road features eight different symbols, with the symbols varying in size from one card to the next. Any two cards have exactly one symbol in common. For the basic Spot it! game, reveal one card, then another. Whoever spots the symbol in common on both cards claims the first card, then another card is revealed for players to search, and so on. Whoever has collected the most cards when the 55-card deck runs out wins!<br/><br/>Rules for different games &ndash; each an observation game with a speed element &ndash; are included, with the first player to find a match either gaining or getting rid of a card.<br/><br/>What's more, the symbols in Spot it! On the Road are all items that you'd see during a typical road trip, and this edition contains a new way to play: One card is revealed, and all players scan the scenery to spot items shown on the card. Whoever spots such an item first claims the card.<br/><br/>",

Each player must build a wall of cards in ascending order. All the cards are laid face-down on the center of the table. Each player starts a wall with the card numbered 1. On each turn the player chooses a card from the center, reveals it to everyone, and then decides to either keep it and put it on the right end of the wall or put it back face-down. The end of the game is triggered when a player puts a 10th card. The player with the wall with the most points wins the game.<br/><br/>",

Players use their cards to perform one of the following actions during their turn: buy cards, fight monsters, or trash cards. Each player builds their own unique deck with their purchases. When a player buys a card, it is placed in their discard pile. When a player no longer has a deck, the discard pile is shuffled and becomes the deck in which players&rsquo; draw their hands. Purchased cards are more powerful than the ten starter cards and help players fight monsters. Players may choose to thin down their deck by trashing cards in order for more powerful cards to be drawn more frequently.<br/><br/>Players have the option of gaining spells during their turn. Spells can be used at any point during the game to either aid a player during their turn or disrupt an opponent&rsquo;s turn.<br/><br/>When a player fights and defeats a monster, the player gains a pixel related to the color of the monster. These pixels are a reusable resource that enhances players&rsquo; cards. When a player defeats a boss, they also gain points based on the monster&rsquo;s rank. These points move the player along on the scoreboard. The first player to reach ten points wins the game.<br/><br/>",

        "description": "We can look into the future.<br/>We can change the future.<br/>We have caused the end... the end of everything.<br/><br/>By experimenting with time, mankind has caused the collapse of the space-time continuum - the Chrono Fall. Rifts are emerging all over space, devouring everything in existence.<br/>You are the captains of the SPARCs, special spaceships in the fight against the Chrono Fall. Fly to remotest places of space, advance technology with your scans and neutralise the dangerous Rifts. With the Chrono-Matrix you can foresee events and modify them, but this will only make the threat worse! Time is running out: can you complete the Protector together and thus avert the near end?<br/><br/>You move your SPARCs and the cargo spaceships over a large map of space, a coordinate system divided into hexagonal fields. The rifts you have to neutralise appear on the map unpredictably by dice rolls at the beginning of each turn, but they can also be planned by various spreading mechanisms. <br/>Fly your SPARC near a rift to scan it and advance science. This way you increase your navigation and neutralisation skills, because without technology advancements you don't stand a chance. <br/>Or is it more important at the moment to clear the path blocked by rifts for a cargo ship? The freighters must bring resources from the other planets to Earth, with which the Protector is being built feverishly. That is your main goal! Without a supply of resources, the saving space station will not be completed in time. <br/>Or do you need to use your action points to collect energy crystals in space? These are necessary to provide the energy for all your actions: Flying, scanning, neutralising... You need energy all the time! You can also charge the crystals for more effective actions, but they will be destroyed afterwards. <br/>At the beginning, choose from several SPARCs. You have to consider their individual skills when assigning the many new challenges. <br/>Since you can see the upcoming event cards, you should always consider together whether you want to intervene in the future by swapping cards in order to avert or minimise the damage caused by the upcoming catastrophes. But weigh the risks well, because every intervention in the future causes additional rifts on the game board.<br/><br/>Chrono Fall: At the End of Space and Time, the new &quot;Kennerspiel&quot; by Ornament Games: cooperative, with unique mechanics and impressive table presence!<br/><br/>-description from publisher<br/><br/>",

The German main goals were the Donau crossings and to the incircle of the 57th Soviet and 1st Bulgarian Armies. A secondary target was to create a starting ground for a new Budapest offensive. An even wider stretch was the oilfields at Ploești, Romania.<br/>Tolling of the Bell is a game recreating this campaign in Hungary from 6th - 25th March, 1945.<br/><br/>Tolling of the Bell is taught in 30 minutes and easy to digest yet a challenge even for the more experienced players.<br/><br/>It is built around the same system of wargaming rules that shaped Plan West&trade;, K&ouml;nigsberg'45&trade;, Army Group Narwa&trade; and Stargard Solstice&trade; making it the 5th game in the WWII Battle Series.<br/>It utilizes a Command chit-pull system to activate HQ, which in turn allow their controlled combat units to move and attack.<br/><br/>Game Scale:<br/>Game Turn: 2 days<br/>Hex: about 3 to about 4 km<br/>Units: Battalion to Division<br/><br/>Solitaire Playability: High<br/>Complexity Level: Medium<br/>Players: 2+<br/>Playing Time: 3-10 hours<br/><br/>",

As of centuries the island ecosystem have been abundant and prosperous, but recently, the population growth and industrial development are threatening the ecosystem and endangering the Tori-tori bird.<br/><br/>Tori-Tori: Endangered Species is a cooperative game where each player takes the role of a environmentalist who is working with her colleagues to save the endangered species from the island. The team must try their best to save the species from a myriad of different hazards, from cats to droughts to lack of native vegetation.<br/><br/>The turn develops in two phases: first the dice are rolled and the island act. Depending on what the dice has shown, players may expect different events: maybe the cats are hungry and they will move or hunt, or it rains in one sector of the island or even the industry is polluting more than usual.<br/><br/>Then, in the second phase, the player must use their action points wisely to act upon what's happening on the island, they may need to protect the Tori-tori, but the rabbits are also in of need vegetation to eat or a fire is spreading widly near the industry.<br/><br/>But not everything is so simple, at first players will have only basic actions to work with, but as the game progress and the players study and specialize they will learn new actions that will have an impact on preserving the life and health of the island ecosystem.<br/><br/>To win the team must transform the town and the industry into an environmentally friendly alternative but if any native species goes extinct the game is over and the team lose.<br/><br/>&mdash;description from the publisher<br/><br/>",

Command of small fleets of ships is very easy in this game, as weapon effectiveness is determined by a single value and weapon damage is a single value (heavy, medium, light, etc).<br/><br/>Ship damage are represented by a damage area with 4 damage levels - two 'lights', a 'heavy', and a 'critical' damage level.  When a weapon damages a ship, a d10 is rolled and the weapon's size is compared against the size of the target ship on a chart to see the resulting damage level (with a chance of 'none' being one of the levels).  If the given damage level is already called for, the next level up is used.  The net effect is as mirrored by hypothetical naval combat - ships take very few hits to be 'mission killed'.<br/><br/>Detection is handled within the rules in a very basic way, although special note should be made of the submarine rules.  They make use of 'range bands' around a target ship.  Submarines are not placed on the 'board' unless detected, making their approach and attack on these 'range band' diagrams, essentially their exact position unknown to BOTH players - neatly avoiding the need for a third player as referee almost always required in other games of the type.<br/><br/>The production values of the game are fairly high - no counters or maps are included, but, given the nature of most modern naval games to use miniatures or simply graph paper, that's certainly forgivable.  The game manual itself is printed on glossy paper with plenty of images throughout (several pages include color images) that really set the mood for the game.<br/><br/>",

Other players will do whatever it takes to build their Burger first. Adding ingredients, taking them away, blowing them up or even sacrificing their own Burger to take you down!<br/><br/>To start the game, players will receive 1 of 8 different Burgers, each with different ingredients.  To win, you must build your Burger to completion while keeping other players from building theirs.<br/><br/>During your turn, you will play an ingredient for your Burger and draw a card; This repeats until you can no longer play.  Once your turn is finished, you can either discard a card or play a Battle Card.<br/><br/>Battle Cards add and take away ingredients, protect your Burger or blow other players' Burgers up. Some can be as simple as switching hands others can be as devastating as destroying all the Burgers on the table, including yours.<br/><br/>-description from designer<br/><br/>",

The battle was divided into two distinct phases, and a scenario is provided that covers each phase as a self-contained game.  Also included is a Campaign Game that allows the Players to refight the series of engagements as a single, continuous game.  The first Scenario, &quot;Spearhead&quot;, involves the period from December 18-21, 1944.  It presents the phase of the battle when the spearhead of the German 5th Panzer Army first approached the vital road and communication center at Bastogne.  The second Scenario, &quot;the Relief of Bastogne&quot;, depicts the situation from December 21-26, the period of Patton's drive up from the south to relieve the siege of Bastogne and open a supply line to the defenders.  Each Game-Turn represents one-half day of actual time, and the scale of the map is approximately 850 meters per hex.&quot;  (from the Bastogne rules folder.)<br/><br/>Bastogne is one of four games included in the Westwall: Four Battles to Germany set.  The game includes a 17&quot; x 22&quot; three-color map, 100 counters and and Exclusive rules folder.  A Standard rules folder, containing rules common to all four games included in the Westwall: Four Battles to Germany Quadrigame is also included.<br/><br/>Game mechanics are a simple movement-combat system with hard zones of control that promote &quot;surround and destroy&quot; tactics.<br/><br/>",

        "description": "Sly Dice is a dice game in which you want to get as many points as possible by scoring various dice combinations. However, you can also bluff about having those combinations and hope that others will not call on you. At the end the player with the most points wins the game.<br/><br/>Each player has three dice, a shield and tokens for marking. There are several combination cards in the middle of the table as well as three common dice that will be used by all players. In each round the starting player rolls the middle dice and then all players also have up to three rolls for their own dice, which are rolled behind player's shield. However, if you want to make a roll after your first one, you have to set one die aside, visible to other players. However, if you roll three times your last roll must remain behind the shield - thus each player will have at least one die that is not visible to others.<br/><br/>When everyone is done with rolling, all players claim, which of the visible combinations they have. The trick is - you can also lie and try to claim a combination, which you don't have. When a player has claimed a combination then all other players in clockwise order have a chance to either accuse him of lying or pass.<br/><br/>1) If everyone passes then the player scores this combination and receives the points it provides. If he lied and didn't have this combination he can now reveal this fact to others - he still scores the combination as if he had it and he also receives one Successful Liar's card, which gives extra points.<br/><br/>2) If anyone accuses the player of lying, then he has to reveal his dice, which creates two possibilities:<br/><br/>If he was not lying then he scores the combination, but the player who accused him takes a False Accusation card, which gives minus points. However, if he was lying then he was accused correctly and doesn't get to score the combination, effectively losing his turn. The accuser doesn't get anything apart from the good feeling that he didn't let the lie slip through.<br/><br/>Thus each player in a round claims one combination. At the end of the round you add a new combination card from the draw pile and begin a new round. After certain number of rounds you tally up the score and the winner is the player with most points.<br/><br/>",

        "description": "For the 10th year anniversary of Sitting Ducks Gallery a Deluxe Edition of the game has been designed, adding unique ducks, introducing hilarious new action cards and with new mechanics to modify the gameplay. These increase the ability to have more players and include all of these great additional cards to the game with hilarious references and images by Randy Martinez.<br/><br/>Sitting Ducks Gallery is a hysterically fun, stick-it-to-your-neighbor, line manipulation game invented by Keith Meyers. Sitting Ducks is reminiscent of the classic carnival-style, midway shooting galleries, where players are trying to take out as many ducks as possible. Players move ducks and targets, take aim, and eventually eliminate other players&rsquo; ducks using a variety of humorous Action Cards, while trying to keep their own safe.  The goal is to be the last duck in the pond!<br/><br/>HOW TO PLAY<br/><br/>In Sitting Ducks, each player gets their own group of ducks. Those ducks are shuffled together and form the Duck Deck, which then become the Duck line.<br/><br/>The Duck line is always in flux - when a Duck is removed; the other ducks move forward to fill the gap.  Certain cards can move the line forward, backwards or rearrange ducks in the line in your favor or your opponents. With the right cards, players may also move and manipulate targets to try to keep their own Ducks safe.<br/><br/>Eventually, you&rsquo;ll get caught snoozing and you will surely lose some of your ducks.<br/><br/>Lose all of your ducks, and you can no longer win the game.  But, one of the most fun aspects of Sitting Ducks is when all of your ducks have been eliminated from the game. Although you won&rsquo;t win, you&rsquo;ll still get a chance to exact revenge on the opponents who took you out and play Action Cards for the rest of the game! The last player to have a duck in the water is the winner!<br/><br/>",

There are several different Pounce editions which have substantially different components, but similar gameplay.  The 2004 edition, for example, has a plastic cat shaped capture device that doesn't resemble a toilet plunger.<br/><br/>A player rolls the dice and depending on their roll either tries to plunge the mice or not.  Players holding the mice must pull their mice away before they are captured.<br/><br/>Similar to:<br/><br/>    3 Blind Mice<br/><br/><br/>---<br/><br/>Gameplay of the German version Spitz pa&szlig; auf!:<br/><br/>Spitz pa&szlig; auf! is a children's game for 2-6 players. One player is drawn by lot to be the die roller for this game. Each player gets a number of tokens, which act as victory points (see further below). <br/>The rest of the players now place their figures, which are attached to little ropes, onto the playing mat in the middle of the play area. The die roller now rolls the die, and, depending on which number shows up (either a 1 or a 6), he must try to put the dice cup over the figures, while the other players must try to pull their figures from the play area before the cup is put over them.<br/><br/>If they don't succeed fast enough, they have to give each other player 1 token. In case they pull their figure from the play area even if no 1 or 6 was rolled, they have to do the same. Also, if the die roller doesn't act fast enough to cover all figures who needed to be trapped in the cup on the roll of 1 or 6, he has to pay 1 token to each other player and pass the die cup to the next player, who the acts as the die roller until he misses to cover a figure, and so on.<br/><br/>Victory is determined when one player has reached a set amount of tokens, or one player has lost all tokens.<br/><br/>Alternatively, especially for young children, there are also colour-coded dice included, and instead of 1 or 6, two colours are determined when the game begins.<br/><br/>",

The French, under the command of Napoleon III, the Piedmontese under Victor Emmanuel II and the Austrians under Franz Josef (the famous husband of the Empress Sisi!). A quarter of a million men. <br/>The largest battle on European soil since Waterloo.<br/>Each of them unaware of the enemy&rsquo;s positions, that they all expected to be further away, the three armies were to fight an encounter battle of gargantuan proportions.  <br/>The battle took place on three fronts. In the north, between the Piedmontese and the talented Benedek&rsquo;s VIIIth Corps; in the centre around the village of Solferino, place of terrible, bloody, hand to hand fighting; and in the south, on the plains of Medole and Guidizzolo, where the French would try in vain to turn the Austrians&rsquo; left wing. <br/>Broken off by a storm of a rare intensity, the battle was to end in a gigantic human tragedy. Europe had not seen as much bloodshed for more than 40 years. 30,000 dead and wounded, 10,000 missing or prisoners of war, another 40,000 sick after the battle due to the makeshift hygienic conditions and lack of provisions.<br/><br/>This game has already been published by the excellent (even if French too...) Vae Victis. This is a reworked and rewritten version, designed for easier play.  Thanks to the topographical talents of Riccardo Rinaldi, the map is an accurate and realistic representation of the historical battlefield. The game system uses a simple table to achieve morale results for fire combat and assault, where units are tested against their morale/cohesion value. The sequence of play with defensive fire during an assault is the standard solution for 19th century battles, and here it works! <br/>The game has high replayability value with many interesting nuances, which we hope you will experience. Playing time for a game is between 3 and 5 hours. And, without spoiling anything in <br/>the game, it also plays very well solitaire.<br/><br/>Scale - Turn: 1 hour . Hexagon: 600 meters.

He has very particular instructions about what should be painted in specific places. Players will take on the role of painters attempting to paint the new fresco according to his instruction, receiving points in the game for painting the Fresco and bonus points for fulfilling the Bishops' requests.<br/><br/>During the game players draw color cards which they will use to paint sections of the fresco. Color cards can be gained from the market, which holds the three basic colors, or from the workshop, which contains the mixed color palette. When players have enough colors they can paint a section of the fresco and gain points. Play the right combination of cards, and you will extra points.<br/><br/>When all sections of the fresco are painted, players total up their points and who has the most points is the winner of the game.<br/><br/>Fresco - The Dice Game<br/><br/>Roll and combine the right combination of dice to gain fresco tiles and be the first to complete your fresco!<br/><br/>The goal of the game is to complete the five different tiles to form a complete fresco. In order to complete a fresco tile players have to roll a result that matches the number next to each fresco tile.<br/><br/>On their turn, players roll the dice exactly three times, on each roll setting one die aside. After the three rolls, the pips on the three set aside dice are added together, which allows the player to collect the corresponding tile. If the result does not match a fresco tile number, they gain a portrait token which will grant bonuses or points. The two color dice can be used to double the number on the corresponding colored die, making it easier to reach the higher numbers.<br/><br/>Before a turn players can place the bishop on one of the five fresco tile spaces, earning extra points if they manage to roll that exact number. Other players can bet on whether the player is successful or not, and will earn some extra points if they guess correctly. At the end of the game, players count the points on their fresco and portrait tiles, and whomever has the most points is the winner of the game.<br/><br/>",

If Time or your Stamina runs out, the heiress is murdered and you lose the game and the Case.<br/><br/>Needed to Play: <br/>The deck of 36 cards<br/>4 YELLOW Investigate Dice<br/>1 RED Paperboy Die<br/>1 GRAY Underworld Connection Die<br/>8 wooden cubes<br/><br/>Game Phases:<br/>1. Storyline - Move the cube on the Time card down one hour and draw the top 3 cards of the Investigate deck. Do not look at their front sides. Choose 1 and place it face up in front of you (this is the current Storyline card); a 2nd card is placed on the discard pile face down; the last card is randomly placed back in the draw deck. Each Investigate card will display a letter designating the type of card - I for Informants, C for Cliffhangers and F for Follow a Lead.<br/><br/>2. Investigate - Check the time remaining in the game and locate the 3 numbered circles at the bottom left of the Storyline card. On the Storyline card, look at the circle in a row with a number closest to, but greater than, the hour marked currently on the Time card. This is the row of icons you must match by rolling your Investigate dice. You may only use the YELLOW Investigate dice to match the Storyline icons, unless you have certain Items that allow you to use the RED and GRAY dice, Twist icons, or your detective&rsquo;s Special Action.<br/><br/>The Hunch - Roll each YELLOW Investigate die, one at a time, as dictated by your Stamina. You may also roll the RED and/or GRAY dice, if you have them. You may choose any of the dice to roll next and/or when to apply any rerolls. Each die shows four icons and each repeats two pairs of those icons, as designated by a *. Choosing which dice to roll and when depends on your detective instincts. Each die is different. If you need to roll a 5th or 6th YELLOW die, choose one of your current dice, noting its current face, and roll it again.<br/><br/>You may subtract an hour of time if your Stamina level is at 1 or 2 to roll an additional YELLOW die. This die may be rolled during the Investigate phase and is lost once the phase has ended.<br/><br/>You may use matching Twist icons, if you have them, in addition to the dice, by removing their marking cubes on the Criminal card.<br/><br/>If you can match the Storyline icons, you gain the reward shown in the white area in that row. If you cannot match the icons, you must lose Stamina, Time or your currently held Item, as shown in the brown area in that row.<br/><br/>If you have failed in your investigation, you may choose one icon from the YELLOW die faces shown and mark this in the Twist section on the Criminal card with a cube. You may save a maximum of 4 Twist icons in this manner.<br/><br/>3. Confront the Criminal - When the 4th clue is found, draw the top card on the Investigate deck and match the die icon shown to those of the 4 criminals on the Criminal card to discover who you must confront to save the heiress. The row of icons shown for this Criminal must be matched by rolling Investigate dice as listed by your current Stamina. You may only use the icons on the YELLOW Investigate dice to match the Criminal icons, unless you have certain Items which allow you to roll the RED and GRAY dice, saved Twist icons, or your detective&rsquo;s Special Action. You may reroll a YELLOW Investigate die of your choice for every 2 hours of Time remaining in the game, rounding down. Match the icons, solve the Case, and win the game!<br/><br/>&mdash;description from the publisher<br/><br/>",

No cards were issued for 1977 to 1979 seasons. Then resumed from 1980 season cards to 1987 season cards  There are fan made sets available.<br/><br/>Individual team and player cards were statistically accurate.  The entire twenty game schedule (including pre-season) could be played out.<br/><br/>This game allows you to pick a CFL team and individual offensive players for the various positions of the offense.  Players cards are rated for the player's abilities during that season.  You select running and passing plays and actually use the player stats.  For example you roll to see if Warren Moon completes a pass and then roll a die on Brian Kelly's card to see how many yards he gets.  Same with kickers and punters etc.  The game flow gives a very good simulation of a CFL game.<br/><br/>",

        "description": "As the shieldwalls clash, ravens fly overhead and lurk where the gory carnage is at its greatest. Break your opponent&rsquo;s shieldwall before your own army loses heart and flees. Victory shall belong to the most cunning warlord, whose name shall be written into the Sagas.<br/><br/>Battle Ravens is a game of Viking Age warfare: a brutal clash of strength, cunning and luck, where subtlety and nuance are neither welcome or commonplace. You need to out-think and out-fight your opponent to win the battle. You do so by choosing whether to command your battle line to attack, defend, or redeploy, through clever use of action points. Combat is resolved by the roll of dice, and armies consist of Hirdmen (armoured warriors), Bondi (unarmoured warriors), and Thralls (cowardly but useful skirmishers!).<br/><br/>- Description from the publisher<br/><br/>",

        "description": "Game description from the publisher:<br/><br/>Who killed the Archmage? Was it Tordek in the Dragon's Lair with the Flaming Battle Axe? Or Mialee in the Dungeon with the Staff of Power?<br/><br/>In Clue: Dungeons &amp; Dragons, a group of heroic adventurers has been called to the Archmage's castle, but one of those heroes isn't who he appears to be; one of the heroes is a doppelganger, a monster that can look like anyone! In the darkest part of the night, the doppelganger kills the Archmage, triggering a spell that seals the castle until the monster is caught. Now, in the grand tradition of Clue, the six suspects must determine which one of them is the doppelganger: Regdar the Human Fighter, Tordek the Dwarf Fighter, Lidda the Halfling Rogue, Mialee the Elf Wizard, Ember the Human Monk or Nebin the Gnome Wizard. The heroes try to figure out Who killed the Archmage, Where the crime occurred, and Which magical weapon was used.<br/><br/>For the most part, gameplay in Clue: Dungeons &amp; Dragons is identical to standard Clue as players roll a die, move into different locations on the game board, then make accusations against a particular combination of who/where/which cards and a particular opponent; if that opponent holds one of those cards, she must reveal it to you. Eventually someone will narrow down the possibilities and make an accusation as to exactly which cards have been removed from the game; if correct the player wins, and otherwise she's out of the game and play continues for everyone else.<br/><br/>One optional element in Clue: Dungeons &amp; Dragons is the Wandering Monsters deck. After landing on a &quot;claw-marked&quot; space on the game board, the player draws the top card from this deck, then battles the creature shown by rolling a die. If she wins, she gains a magic item that confers a single-use special ability, such as looking at a random card from an opponent's hand or taking an extra turn. If she loses, her token is placed in the center of the game board, from where it will take several turns to move back into a room (and get back into the game).<br/><br/>",

        "description": "At the end of June 1862, the Confederate general Robert E. Lee, leading the Army of Northern Virginia defeated the Army of the Potomac, commanded by the Union general George McClellan during the Seven Days Battles, thereby saving Richmond. Having put an end to the Union&rsquo;s Peninsula campaign, Lee decided to put pressure on Washington and regain the initiative. Though outnumbered, he would do his utmost to avoid the junction of the Union armies in the Eastern Theater. His first target was the new and inexperienced Army of Virginia led by the Union general John Pope. Lee dispatched General Thomas J. &quot;Stonewall&quot; Jackson (victorious in the Shenandoah Valley Campaign of the previous winter)   to intercept the Union. The vanguard of both armies met in Culpeper County in Virginia. The Union general Banks positioned his artillery on the ridge near Cedar Mountain and a cannon battle ensued. The Confederate general Winder, leading the southerners, was mortally wounded in action, resulting in confusion and withdrawal for the south. Upon seeing this, Stonewall advanced the reserves and led the counter-attack himself. Faced with this unexpected wave, the Union line was broken and the soldiers retreated in disorder.<br/><br/>As Jackson, will you be able to win the first battle of the Northern Virginia Campaign or will you change the course of history wearing Banks&rsquo; blue uniform?<br/><br/>This game published in VaeVictis #153 uses the Civil War Brigade Battle system (Worthington Games).<br/><br/>Scale:<br/>Complexity : 4/10<br/>Solo playability : 7/10<br/>Duration : 1 hour 30<br/>One turn = 40 minutes<br/>One counter = 1 brigade<br/>Scale : 200 meters<br/><br/>-description from designer<br/><br/>",

        "description": "&ldquo;Royal Defense&rdquo; is an easy fantasy-themed strategy game. You are supposed to assume the role of the militant feudal and to put a halt to the hostile lords&rsquo; encroachments on the throne of the fairy kingdom. Mercenaries will help you: they are ready to spill their blood on the battlefield for a pretty penny and promises of glory.<br/><br/>&ldquo;Royal Defense&rdquo; vaguely resembles &ldquo;Battles of magicians&rdquo; and &ldquo;Memoir&rsquo;44&rdquo;. Lords&rsquo; castles are located on both sides of the game-board. Players can recruit troops and build fortifications there. The battlefield itself is two-sided and it contains special structures, giving bonuses to players who occupy these locations.<br/><br/>Before starting the game, each player chooses one of the four mercenary factions, which will be his army. Characters of each faction are represented by the cards. They have their own  particularities, strengths and weaknesses. A lot of soldiers have not only ordinary characteristics such as velocity, attack and defence, but also some special abilities (which are very often unique for the army) that can be used during the game.<br/><br/>The confrontation between barons is very swift. Having recruited troops from hand, a player can move forward and attack. As soldiers can move only forward, so five &ldquo;corridors&rdquo; appear on the battlefield where the major battles occur. But each player can activate only five units during his or her turn, and some characters can change the lines they move along. All these points transform simple mechanics into an interesting tactical puzzle. The more the player is experienced, the more difficult is to solve this puzzle. Moreover, spells, able to change course of action, are available for each player. Soldiers also can be sent to the Catacombs in the hope of finding treasures hidden there.<br/><br/>There are two ways to win: to help your mercenaries to end up beyond the edge of your adversary&rsquo;s field or to get 20 points for having struck adversary&rsquo;s troops and having destroyed his structures.<br/><br/>&ldquo;Royal Defense&rdquo; is a duel strategy game with low learning curve. Its rules are easy to explain and the game will not take long. Besides, rules also propose different options for three and four players.<br/><br/>",

Marshal Soult thought he could roll up a mixed Spanish/British/Portuguese force and claim a great French victory. He was wrong. A clever flank attack was stopped dead by some of the best Spanish troops of the war. Then, despite a devastating charge by his fearsome Polish Lancers, the Allies held firm and Soult's efforts were in vain.<br/><br/>Lines of Battle is a new series, of which Albuera 1811 is the first game. It features a fresh take on Napoleonic gaming where the essence of Napoleonic combat is distilled into an enjoyable and interactive battle experience - you can feint, outflank, form square, charge with cavalry, bombard, withdraw - it's all here.<br/><br/>As well as the historical battle, Albuera 1811 contains optional rules for Leaders (counters included), and you can construct any number of scenarios based on a combination of &quot;what if&quot; optional rules.<br/><br/>&mdash;description from the publisher<br/><br/>",

Every player selected contributes one Item card to a common pool, and other items are added randomly from the draw pile. These cards can be helpful, non-helpful, or even harmful. The Party Leader distributes one card to each party member, and the Quest commences, with each player taking a turn using the item they were given, if able. To use the items given, each player uses dice that are secretly pulled and rolled, but beware, doppelg&auml;ngers may choose to roll cursed dice! If the party succeeds, the Party Leader may search for an Artifact of Light. Find three of these, and the loyal adventurers win the game. However, if a Quest fails, an Artifact of Darkness may be found, and if three are uncovered, the doppelg&auml;ngers win. Players must also take care to watch their health, because if any player dies, the game ends, and the dead player's loyalty determines the winners and losers.<br/><br/>",

In the 2 player version, one player controls the Spartans and the other player controls the Persians. In the 3 player game, 2 players compete for the most Glory as the Spartans, and in a 4 player game, 2 players also compete as the Persians for the most Spartan kills.<br/><br/>At the start of the game, the battle forces (represented by round cardboard Units) are already lined up and ready to fight at the border of the Hot Gates. Each time a Persian Unit dies, the Spartans score Glory Points on the Glory Track that surrounds the board. Spartan Units die permanently, while most defeated Persian Units can enter the game again as reinforcements.<br/><br/>The Object of the Game for the Spartans is to score 100 Glory (or 50 Glory if there are 2 Spartan players). The Object of the Game for the Persians is to wipe out the Spartans before they can achieve their Glory, or to delay the Spartans long enough for Ephialtes to reach the end of the Goat Path (6 rounds of play). If there are 2 Persian Players, then the player with the most Spartan kills wins this game.<br/><br/>The game uses cards and dice to simulate the action from the film. Spartan Heroes include Leonidas, Stelios, the Captain, Dilios, and Astinos. Persian Leaders include Xerxes, the Uber Immortal, and the Persian Generals. Each card simulates the action associated with a quote from the film, such as &quot;I Would Gladly Kill My Own Men For Victory&quot; (Persian) and &quot;Tonight We Dine In Hell!&quot; (Spartan).<br/><br/>The game plays quickly (20 - 30 minutes), and is meant to be a fast diversion with a good share of both tactics and luck.<br/><br/>Official 2-Player Variants<br/><a target='_blank' href=\"https://boardgamegeek.com/thread/671632/2-player-variants\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer noopener\">https://boardgamegeek.com/thread/671632/2-player-variants</a><br/><br/>",

The board is set between the players, leaving a space in front of each player.<br/><br/>For MEM-Solitaire, you need only one playing space and the filled board.<br/><br/>The General Idea<br/>You take stones from the MEM board, and use them to build patterns of stones in your playing area.  The pattern of stones in your playing area must always &quot;match&quot; some group of stones remaining on the board.  In two-person play, your opponent will try to take stones that make it easy for him to build matching patterns, and make it hard for you to find good matches on the board.

You've had each other's backs, but we fear some of your team may have been bought off by the hunters &mdash; especially since our last team didn't come back. Trust no one but yourself!<br/><br/>In Exodus: Paris Nouveau, you're a member of a specialist team sent on a rescue mission to save refugees trapped in an urban warzone. At the start of the game, the players are secretly and randomly divided into two teams: those with a secret hunter ID card are on the hunters team, and those with a secret rescuer ID card are on the rescuers team. The problem is that although you know which team you're on, you don't know which of the other players are also on your team and which are on the other team!<br/><br/>Further, in Exodus: Paris Nouveau, you win or lose as a team. Throughout the game, you use abilities, deduction, and guesswork to determine your team members, and together strive to win as a team. The game may end in a number of ways:<br/><br/><br/>    If a player has no life tokens, the game immediately ends. That player reveals their secret ID card and their team loses, resulting in a win for the other team. <br/>    The hunters win (and the rescuers lose) immediately if no cover tokens remain in the game. <br/>    The hunters win (and the rescuers lose) immediately if the total hunter distance (i.e., the sum of the distance values on all face-up cards in the hunter line) equals or exceeds the total rescuer distance (i.e., the number of distance tokens remaining in the game plus the sum of the distance values on all face-up cards in the rescuer line).<br/>    If the game hasn't ended beforehand, it concludes at the end of the seventh round. In this case, the rescuer's team score is the number of victory point icons on the face-up cards in the rescuer line (i.e., each running figure symbol is worth one victory point), and the hunter's team score is the number of victory point icons on the face-up cards in the hunter line. Whichever team has the higher score wins.<br/>    If scores are tied, continue playing rounds until either an immediate-win condition has been met or at the end of a round one team has a higher score than the other, at which point they're declared the winning team.<br/><br/><br/>",

They then read the question aloud to the other players.<br/><br/>3- The other players chat and have to all agree how they think the Judge has ranked the characters. Reveal the answer. If the players guessed the correct ranking everyone wins the round; if not everyone loses.<br/><br/>EXAMPLE:  <br/>Q: Who would you choose as the drummer in your rock band? <br/>&mdash;Hermione Grainger <br/>&mdash;George Washington <br/>&mdash;Shrek<br/><br/>Start a new round, reveal three new characters and the next player becomes the Judge. Play until all players have been the Judge. You all win if you have succeeded more often than failing. It leads to hilarious arguments but it's not easy!<br/><br/>",

With these, they try to steer the ball towards and eventually across the net. Quick attacks prevent the opposing team to fill up their hand cards, but are also usually less coordinated. Well-prepared articles allow the attacker to draw a random defense card from an opponent. A team that cannot hit the ball across the net with a maximum of three cards, loses a point.<br/><br/>One cat of the scoring team then goes to sleep. A ball that hits that cat's sector is an automatic point, but it also wakes up the sleeping cat. First team to reach three points wins the game.<br/><br/>",

The first one to use all of their pieces wins the game.<br/><br/>Suits come in 4 colors and run from 1 to 13. Notably, runs (of the same suit) can end with a 1 tile if they contain a 13 tile.<br/><br/>The game needs paying careful attention on the opponent's discarded pieces and plan new series according to them, as there is only a pair of every piece.<br/><br/>The game's namesake is the wild &quot;Okey&quot; tile, chosen randomly between the regular tiles at the start of every round.<br/><br/>Depending on the last tile a player discards to win a round, they score different amounts of points- finishing by discarding a regular tile is worth 2 points, but discarding an Okey tile is worth 4 points. An &quot;indicator&quot; tile is used to determine the Okey every round, and if someone has the identical indicator tile in their starting hand, they score an extra point.<br/><br/>Scoring is done in a unique manner- every point scored by a player is not added to their own total, but subtracted from every other player's score. The game ends when someone reaches 0 points or lower, and at that point the person with the highest remaining score wins. A usual game of Okey starts with 20 points per player.<br/><br/>",

Each card gives you special advantages, each city gains you more acclaim&mdash;and in turn gets you in front of audiences large and small. Then you choose how points are assigned for you, and no one else.

Levitate has a creative mechanic for turn order so you don&rsquo;t always follow the same player and a wide variety of card effects and player goals so no game will be the same.<br/><br/>You&rsquo;ll learn from the three most powerful stage magicians of the 1800s. Howard Thurston, Harry Kellar, and Alexander Hermann. They will teach you stunning illusions using technology, sleight of hand, the use of accomplices, gadgets, and camouflage.  Gain points for these types of mechanics, but only the first player to choose those points receives them.<br/><br/>Be the master of close-up magic, medium sized tricks, or dominate the stage with gigantic effects with elephants and carriages. When one teacher is out of dice, simply re-roll all dice and keep the magic going. Each effect learned reveals a new place to perform and an opportunity to gain acclaim, add flair, or gain points. Your road to the biggest cities must connect.  Then once the show is done, new illusions are placed on the board. As you add flair to each illusion, points are gained each time you show them.<br/><br/>Some illusions will allow you to control the game, move your workers to new locations, manipulate dice present on the teachers, gain more acclaim, add new workers, duplicate other players&rsquo; cards, and learn certain types of effects instantly.<br/><br/>-description from designer<br/><br/>",

        "description": "The Struggle between the Russian and Ottoman Empires was already centuries old when war broke out in 1877. It had its origins in the bitter conflict between Muslims and Christians, Slavs and Turks. The war proved to be a turning point in that it completely altered the balance of power in the east. In less than 40 years this helped produce the European catastrophe known as the Great War (WW I). Echoes of these ethnic and religious troubles resound today, as the peoples of Balkans and Near East still fight each other in a struggle for dominance. The Russo-Turkish War did not just cripple the Ottoman Empire. It made Russia into the dominant power in the East, and demonstrated the twin impact of modern technology and modern ideology on warfare.<br/><br/>The System rules apply to all games in the Wars of the Imperial Age series, and simulate the conditions of warfare in the late 19th century. This is a revision of the System rules presented with Franco-Prussian War (S&amp;T #149), and completely replaces the System rules book found there. Important changes from the original version are indicated by a double pound sign (##) at the beginning of the rule. Players familiarizing themselves with the game may wish to use just the System rules. The Specific Rules that apply only to the particular game and cover military and political conditions unique to the specific situation.<br/>Units represent historical leaders and headquarters staffs; corps, division-, and brigade-sized units; and fortifications. Each unit is rated for its combat strength, training class, and movement ability. (Specific Rules) Additionally, headquarters are rated for their Operations capability to enhance movement and combat capabilities, as well as conduct various politically oriented functions.<br/><br/>All units are deployed face down, and are revealed to the enemy only if he conducts reconnaissance or intelligence operations. Movement is performed by the moving force rolling on one of four March tables (Regular March, Forced March, Railroad, Naval) and applying the result. Combat is fought between enemy units in individual adjacent hexes; each player draws a Battle Results marker at random. This gives the number of enemy combat factors eliminated, effects on enemy morale, and special results for cavalry, and siege guns.The typical size of units are brigades.<br/><br/>Politics are a factor in the game. Each side has a National Will Index which gives the current level of popular support. This is affected by combat outcomes and other game events. (Specific Rules) Each turn, players have the opportunity to draw Political Events markers, representing various factors affecting the outcome of the conflict.<br/> Published in Strategy &amp; Tactics magazine #154, Sep 1992.  Errata was published in S&amp;T #157 &amp; 159.<br/>Replacement counters were issued in S&amp;T #162 (2 counters) and S&amp;T #171 (1 counter).<br/><br/>",

        "description": "Wolfed is a card game, based on the famous (game) Mafia, also known as Werewolf. The rules are simple. The game is divided into days and nights. The werewolves kill a member of the village each night. During the day the remaining villagers need to find out who are the werewolves and lynch them, before they are all killed. The werewolves are considered winners once their number equals the number of the remaining survivors.<br/><br/>Wolfed is both simple and amusing game. It is an awesome way to break the ice especially for parties, team buildings, or just a way to have fun with your friends or complete strangers. It is an amazing social experience. Each game is unique on its own as there are near infinite number of combinations that you can play.<br/><br/>Wolfed has unique art-style. Each character in the game has its own design. There are no 2 cards that look alike. There are also event cards which bring twists and turns in each game. And of course at the end we added a pinch of new roles you have never seen before. They have been thoroughly tested to make sure that the balance remains unchanged. <br/>The rules have been improved and written from scratch to make sure they are easily understandable.<br/><br/>",

You may play as one of the warring vampire clans such as Ventrue, Tremere, Gangrel, or Toreador, or perhaps you'll choose to become one of the human factions fighting for their own desires, such as City Hall, the Mafia, or the Arcanum, with many more from which to choose.<br/><br/>Additionally, the game integrates the story world of Vampire: The Masquerade by adding storyteller scenarios that add an optional narrative approach to the game. Players also gain disciplines, which give them powerful supernatural abilities unique to their character. Lastly, teams will choose their ambitions, which allow for multiple paths to victory, such as being bloodthirsty, manipulative, greedy, or somewhere in between.<br/><br/>Blood Feud is dubbed a &quot;Mega Board Game&quot; because unlike a traditional board game, it isn't played at a single table. Blood Feud requires a large room or two separate rooms with 2-4 tables. One game table features the Cityscape and Orders, the map where players move their forces around the city and order them to fight and take control of important territories. The other game table features the Council and Market, where players use their best diplomatic and resource management skills to make sly trades, buy upgrades and player level-ups, and make large political decisions that will shape the destinies of teams to determine whether they win or lose! In order to win the game, teams earn victory points through the completion of legacies, which are secret objectives that can consist of all sorts of tasks and achievements  earned through gameplay.<br/><br/>",

In these two games two players will try to accumulate the most points.<br/><br/>The first game is a word game called Le mot le plus long. Both players randomly draw letter tiles asking for either a vowel or a consonant and then they both try to find the longest word using only those letters.<br/><br/>The second game is a math game called Le compte est bon. Five tiles are randomly drawn. Each of these tiles have a number on it. Then a number between 100 and 999 is randomly generated and both players try to get as close as possible to this number using only the number tiles and the four basic operations.<br/><br/>Second description from Paroliamo:<br/>An early 1980 game, published after quite some success of the game in TV shows in Italy on Telemontecarlo and, after, on Rai 2 (second Italian national channel).<br/><br/>The game is similar to Scrabble and Boggle, the goal is to reach 50 points composing the longest word with the available letters represented by the cards.<br/><br/>Every player, in turn, must choose 10 letters at random, stating, one after another, if he/she wants a vowel (red cards) or a consonant (blue cards). After the 10 cards are drawn, players have a fixed amount of time to compose the longest word with the 10 available letters.<br/><br/>",

Each player has a colored dung heap with a number of these cards next to the heap, meaning that these animals are hiding in this colored area. Several animals in hiding might also be placed next to the barn. A &quot;slapping&quot; card for each colored area in play, as well as the barn, is placed around a central deck of seek cards.<br/><br/>Each seek card shows one of the animals currently hiding. On a turn, a player reveals a seek card so that all players can see it, then everyone races to slap the correct slapping card. If you do so first, you claim the hiding card of that animal, moving it next to your dung heap. (If you own that hiding card already, you just keep it.) Slap the wrong slapping card, and you must move one hiding card to the barn, putting that animal in a new home.<br/><br/>If a poop card is revealed, then you're trying to find the animal revealed on the previous turn, which might now be at a new location. The player with the most hiding cards by his dung heap when the seek deck runs out wins the game.<br/><br/>",

Players score points for each faction (not each card) they control. A player controls a faction when they have the most player markers of their color on cards of that faction. In case of a tie, all tied players control this faction and all those players score points for that faction. For each faction you control, you receive the amount of points indicated on the top left corner of the card. The player with the most points wins. In case of a tie, the tied player with the most player markers left in their supply wins.

        "description": "Human Interface: Nakamura Tower (HINT) is a board game that is a unique combination of many elements known from tactical and skirmish games, RPGs and board games. The game is based on a struggle between two powerful megacorporations that takes place in the title tower.<br/><br/>HINT is designed for 2+ people but through different scenarios can be played alone, in cooperation or against other players. The story happens in the near future when the world is dominated by new technologies.<br/><br/>In HINT you will lead a team of selected professionals of a given faction. Each of them has unique skills and abilities, each one can be given weapons and other equipment, be enhanced genetically or cybernetically. All characteristics and modifiers are presented on special character and equipment cards (you don&rsquo;t need to constantly flick through the rulebook). Each character card has a limited amount of slots that can be filled with equipment and modifications. The player can purchase additional equipment to replace the current item depending on the &ldquo;group&rsquo;s assets&rdquo;. You may like your heroes or hate them but they will no longer be just anonymous pawns.<br/><br/>The game is played on a board showing the interior of the Nakamura corporate tower that is under attack by its rivals. The characters are moved using spaces on the board. This eliminates the need to measure distance when moving and fighting thus quickening the pace of the game and allowing to avoid misunderstandings. Each space presents a specific tactical situation that influences the characters placed on it.<br/><br/>Game mechanics are fairly easy as we wanted to achieve a perfect balance between a fun game and rules that enable a lot of tactical possibilities. The basic rules are easy to learn but the possibilities of their use grow significantly in combination with the characters&rsquo; skills and capabilities of equipment. The characters are defined by their basic physical and mental abilities and modifiers, which make it easier or more difficult to perform some tasks, that make them unique. These modifiers result from their skills, special training or cyberations and other equipment. The rules do not use any dice and the testing mechanics are based on cards that we call CanDo. The description on the card, its value and colour influence the final result of the test. The numerical value also states the location of a hit and additional effects connected to it.<br/><br/>",

Like life, it starts simply, and then becomes challenging as you develop skills.<br/><br/>Setup: Place the hexagonal bases in any layout.  This is entirely up to the players, and can drastically change the game play, offering a lot of replay options.  Place a number of cards face down randomly, again adding to replay.  Deal each player 5 cards and choose your side (green or purple).<br/><br/>Play: Players alternate turns placing the triangular cards into the slots on the hexagonal bases.  Based on how you place a card, you may flip face down cards.  The goal is to score points while maintaining balance between man and nature (purple and green).  Points are earned when a base is full, but can be lost as more cards are played on that base.  If your color has the most cards on a base, you gain 2 points for that area.  If the total of the numbers on the cards in an area is positive, purple gets a point.  If negative total, green gets a point.  These points overlap with most cards of a color points, so keeping track of the points is important.  The first player to 4 points wins.  However, you are both playing with the same deck, and cards of each color, so it's not as simple as it may seem.  You can raise or lower your opponent's total on an area, and if the total is +-7 or more, the corresponding color cards are all removed and play continues with what remains.<br/><br/>",

This is a solitaire game, played in scenarios. The player must accomplish the scenario&rsquo;s Objective, which will be generated at random at the start of the scenario.<br/> You, the player, must manage your carrier, its air group, and your escorts. As you operate your battlegroup, you will encounter various Soviet warships, aircraft, missiles, and unexpected opportunities and objectives. These are represented by Incident chits.<br/><br/>The game presumes that you are seeing the situation from the bridge of an aircraft carrier. Hence, carrier operations are shown in considerable detail, while other US Navy and opposing Soviet actions are more abstracted.<br/> The possibility of running into enemy forces will be increased via the Alert Level, representing how much the Soviet Navy&rsquo;s command is concentrating its resources against your task force. When contact is made with enemy forces, you will go to the game&rsquo;s Tactical Routine to resolve combat. A scenario ends when you reach your Objective, where you must use your boldness to accomplish the final objective.<br/><br/>",

Each player has a bunch of cards to pass them or prevent his opponents to do it.<br/><br/>Cards can be used in two ways: as a key to pass a room of a certain kind or as an action that can slow your opponents or give you advantages. You can use as many cards as you can during your turn.

If he does, both of you gain a gem. Gems can be used to increase the effect of a card you are playing, drawing cards and passing through rooms for free.

        "description": "Help! Lava is coming!! In Mauna Kea, you're exploring a previously unknown volcanic island in the South Pacific with your research team when suddenly there's a terrible roar: The volcano has come to life! Now, you must find as many artifacts as possible and bring them, along with your researchers, to the rescue boats at the coast. If you plan your ways cleverly and have a little bit of luck, you'll survive the volcanic eruption as the rescuing hero!<br/><br/>Each player starts the game with a team of 3-5 researchers (depending on the number of players) and a set of randomly selected terrain tiles that collectively have at least five movement points; the more jungle spaces on a tile, the more movement points it provides. On a player's turn, he must play all of his tiles in any order he wants, either placing them on the game board to expand the terrain on which players can move or spending the movement points to move his researchers to orthogonally adjacent spaces (1 point to enter jungle, 2 points to enter water, 16,000 points to enter mountain &mdash; actually, you can't enter a mountain space). If his researcher enters a space with an artifact, he then drags that artifact with him as he moves. If his researcher reaches a boat, he fills as many seats as possible with artifacts, then hits the water. Sorry, chumps!<br/><br/>At the end of his turn, he draws new tiles &mdash; and if he pulls a lava tile from the bag, he places it on the board immediately. Lava flows away from the central cone, with each tile indicating the side of the volcano from which it flows. If lava hits established terrain, it covers that terrain; if it hits researchers and artifacts, it covers them, too. Players continue taking turns until someone has no researchers left on the island, whether due to them leaving the island or donning a lava blanket. Everyone else takes one final turn, then players score, collecting 3 points per saved researcher, 1-3 points for each artifact, and -1 point for each empty space on the boats they used. The player with the highest score wins.<br/><br/>In the advanced game, players don't return tiles to the bag when they use them for movement points. Instead they start the game with four action or task cards in hand. They can play as many action cards as they wish on a turn to help their researchers cross mountains, swim faster, or helicopter to safety, but they have only four for the entire game. The game now ends when a player has no researchers or no tile remain in the bag. In addition to their other points, players now score for completed task cards, earning points for specific combinations of artifacts or for taking a certain boat. Again, the player with the highest score wins.<br/><br/>",

At the start of your turn, you must choose to be Home or Away, giving you access to a different set of actions that you can perform. While Home, you can gain points and abilities by playing cards onto your yard and swaying Neighbors to your side. While Away, you can earn money and get new cards from a shared store, but you leave your yard vulnerable to your rival's mischief. When the last Neighbor has been swayed, the game ends, and whoever has the most points wins.<br/><br/>&mdash;description from publisher<br/><br/>",

        "description": "Koplopers en Dwarsliggers<br/><br/>The game Koplopers en Dwarsliggers puts the players in charge of their own railway company. These companies may use all railway tracks in the Netherlands. Their only goal is to transport as many passengers as possible to their intended destinations. For these passengers the journey from Rotterdam to Amsterdam may well go via Eindhoven.<br/><br/>Sometimes there is a sudden change of direction when the train has picked up more passengers, and a majority of those want to go to another part of the country. At other times trains may well skip stations when no passengers need to be there. And when a train does call at a station the passengers enter quickly hoping that they will arrive at their destination today. Is your train the one to be in? How many times they must change trains in order to arrive at their destination? Or will they not make it at all, because of those annoying obstructions?<br/><br/>Introduction to the game<br/>In Koplopers en Dwarsliggers every player may construct up to three trains and each of those trains can transport up to 500 passengers. During the game you pick up passengers at stations and put their tokens at your train organizer card in the corresponding box. And then you try to transport your passengers to their destinations, after which you collect their tokens in your tray. Each turn you may spend five action points that you can use for constructing or scrapping trains, but you may also combine trains, split them up again, or reverse them. You can pick up passengers, transport them or have them change trains, and finally you can play obstruction cards or perform an emergency repair. The player who has brought the highest number of passengers to their destination wins the game.<br/><br/>Some interesting facts<br/><br/>        Koploper is a Dutch train type (see game box), but it also means &lsquo;front runner&rsquo;. The railway meaning of dwarsligger is sleeper, but it also is Dutch for an obstructive person;<br/>        The game board is based on the actual railway lay-out in the Netherlands;<br/>        The abbreviations used to denote stations are the official abbreviations used by the Dutch railway companies;<br/>        The designer of the game works for Nederlandse Spoorwegen, the main passenger railway company in the Netherlands.<br/><br/><br/>",

Settlements, cities, and roads earn their owners victory points (VPs), and the first player to have ten VPs wins.<br/><br/>Where Baden-W&uuml;rttemberg Catan differs from some Catan games &ndash; yet is similar to others, such as Catan Geographies: Germany &ndash; is that the game board features the southwestern state of Baden-W&uuml;rttemberg (with fixed resource numbers on the locations) and players can build key landmarks within the state, such as the Stuttgarter Fernsehturm or Heidelberg Castle.<br/><br/>",

Each round consists of players creating actions by combining a worker in play with a card from hand:<br/><br/><br/>     Merchants hire new workers.<br/>     Knights compete to recruit workers from the common pool.<br/>     Bakers offer their goods in exchange for workers' actions.<br/>     Scholars train others in the ways of the Renaissance Man.<br/><br/><br/>Instead of providing these actions for a player, a worker in play can be assigned to support higher-level workers. Two workers are required for support, and they are laid out as such in a pyramid-fashion. Five workers create a player's foundation, and the first player to complete a pyramid structure of fifteen workers creates a single Master of study, thus winning the game. A little luck will help along the way, but the day will surely go to the player who finds the most clever ways out of the trickiest situations in Renaissance Man!<br/><br/>",

Unfortunately, the government has cut your group's funding and that means you all are going to need jobs to support your superhero lifestyle. Sadly, there is but one job to be had in town at the local restaurant. The restaurant owner has decided to let you all tryout for the job and whoever has the most tips by the end of the day gets it.<br/><br/>Born to Serve is a board game brawl between two to four jobless superheroes for the last job in town....at the local restaurant....waiting tables.  Oh how the mighty have fallen.<br/><br/>In Born to Serve, players are recently unemployed second tier super heroes in competition for a single wait staff job at a restaurant.  Players serve tables by placing their time markers on them and ultimately the player who spends the most time on a table wins the table's tip. Players can also spend their time markers on the restaurant staff who allow them to use additional abilities to gain additional money or shift the odds in their favor on a table.  Of course, being super heroes, each player also has two (nominally useful) powers that allows them to bend certain strategies in their favor. The player who earns the most money in tips wins the job and the game.<br/><br/>",

Picking refurbished or out-of-date parts to build robots that meet eager buyers' requirements. Sell your completed robots to earn points and achieve certain bonuses to earn even more points &mdash; but hurry because other players may be building a robot to sell to the same buyer first.  Can you outsmart your opponents and assemble a four-wheeler robot with two heads, or a robot with six eyes and four hands before they do?<br/><br/>In Robots on the Line, robot parts move down two conveyor belts. Players take turns pulling robot parts (heads, bases, arms, hands, batteries, antennas and magnets). Not all robot parts can be taken, however. The line you're pulling from must be switched to ON. Robot parts that aren't taken will be discarded onto the junk pile. Players can pay a dollar to go through the junk pile or they can pay a dollar to turn ON/OFF switches. As players take robot parts, they build robots in front of them. Players can build up to four robots in a game. Trading is always allowed.<br/><br/>To finish a robot it must have a torso, a head, and a base with all other segments off the torso ended with the other parts. While you're building, you'll want to look to the buyers to meet their requirements. A requirement might be a robot with four eyes, or a robot that has no wheels, or a robot with three hands. If you meet a buyer's requirement, you sell it for money. If you meet the bonuses, like medical, war, or cleaning, you get even more money. The game ends when all tiles are off the line or when a player has built 3 robots. The player with the most money wins.<br/><br/>",

If a boat is captured by the pirates, the players have a chance to rescue the prisoners... at the cost of valuable time and supplies.<br/><br/>This cooperative game is played on a board which shows the route from Adventure Island back to the player's home town. Each player starts with a boat on Adventure Island, and two pirate ships are placed along the route. The game is played in turns. Each turn, a player rolls two dice, then choses one die to use for his own boat and one die to use for one of the pirate ships. Both are moved as many places forward as the selected die shows. At certain points, the player can have his ship take a hidden route, which is not used by the pirate ships.<br/><br/>If a pirate ship passes a boat, or if a boat passes a pirate ship, the boat is captured and placed on Pirates' Island. Other boats can free it if they manage to land on one of the rescue spaces on the track; the rescued boat is then returned to that same space.<br/><br/>When all boats have reached the home town, the players have won the game. However, if some ships are captured while all other ships have reached the home town, the players lose.<br/><br/>The difficulty level can be increased by giving each player two or three boats instead of one. The greatest challenge is the Grand Adventure, in which each player has three boats, there is a third pirate ship, and each player may hide on the hidden routes at most five turns during the game.<br/><br/>The 2011 AMIGO edition is part of its &quot;&Ouml;kologisch + Kooperativ&quot; (Ecological &amp; Cooperative) line of games.<br/><br/>",

Connect same colored railways. If you draw a train card, you can play one more time. Tunnel cards and storm cards can be drawn anytime. Only a dice knows what will happen when a storm card is drawn.<br/><br/>On a player's turn, they can play a card that connects to a similar color rail card on the table. Alternatively, if they are not able or don't want to do that action, they may draw a card.<br/><br/>The first player to empty their hand of cards wins the game.<br/><br/>",

Many items have effects that will further expand your tactical options as your deck grows.<br/><br/>As you defeat monsters and pick up loot, do your best to remember where everything is hidden. Treasures and slain monsters are worth gold, so get collecting! Once the dungeon has been thoroughly ransacked, or the boss is defeated, whoever has the most gold wins!<br/><br/>This deck is a standalone dungeon complete with items, monsters, and a Boss &mdash; the sinister Silver Queen.

Using your decay actions, stealing spores, and blocking other mushrooms are just some of the ways to get ahead in the game. Players can evolve their own playing style, perhaps playing more aggressively to steal other players' spores or disrupt their mycelial network &mdash; or perhaps playing more defensively to try to protect their own area and spores.<br/><br/>The board is made up of triangle tiles that represent different environments and nutrients that the mushrooms need to grow. These tiles can be added to the board by the players, so the board is always growing and evolving.<br/><br/>Mycelia incorporates beautiful and accurate botanical style illustrations with over 69 mushrooms that can be found in the wild.<br/><br/>&mdash;description from the publisher<br/><br/>",

Game Theory and Related Approaches to Social Behavior, John Wiley &amp; Sons, Inc., New York.<br/><br/>This game was devised in 1950 as a simple social game to model the behavior of people when forming coalitions.  To make progress in the game you must form a coalition with at least one other player, but to actually win requires betraying your coalition.  It is said that 'The four authors still occasionally talk to each other' and the initial tests of the game resulted in married couples going home from parties in separate cabs.<br/><br/>The objective is to be the last player with a stockpile of chips.  (Each player starts with seven of a unique color.) Each play reduces your stockpile by one chip, and it is replenished through captures or gifts from other players. Players have some measure of control over who plays next, but captures either benefit another player or require that another player chooses to let you make a capture.<br/><br/>Players may form any non-binding agreements provided that all discussion is done at the table.  Working together allows players to capture chips and force other players out of the game.  In the end, one player must betray their coalitions to win.<br/><br/>The authors are also responsible for inventing the dollar auction and a great deal of economic theory.<br/><br/>",

        "description": "Fjordar is an epic, tactical strategy game for 1 to 4 players, set during the Norwegian Civil War. The game begins in the year 1130, when the old king Sigurd Jorsalfar dies. Each player begins the game as one of Sigurd's heirs or one of the other influential people in Norway at the time, who is vying for power in the vacuum left by the old king's death.<br/><br/>As the game progresses through the 110 years of the conflict, players will use their heirs that are spread around the board to either strengthen their influence through marriage, or to continue the fight for control over Norway. By gaining glory in combat you can also attract famous warriors to your cause.<br/><br/>The game is played on a modular, semi-abstract, three dimensional board with a typical Norwegian coastal landscape, with mountains, fjords and islands, without being a map of Norway. Since the board is modular, players can set up the board in a new way each time they play, giving them the possibility for endless variety.<br/><br/>A player's turn in Fjordar typically goes like this:  You play a card with movement points and various abilities, and use the movement points to move your units and establish supplylines. If you have moved one or more of your units into an area with enemy soldiers, you and the other player resolve combat by each choosing a combat card in secret and reveal them simultaneously, with the combat cards adding extra strength to your units' base strength. What combat card is the most effective is highly dependent on each situation. <br/>You may then use your units to perform various actions at the different locations on the board. In forests you can build new ships, churches and villages. In villages you can muster troops and collect taxes, while in the castles you can marry away your heirs or bring them home to your own castle along your supplylines.<br/><br/>Some of the effects on previously played movement cards and combat cards also carry over to your later turns, which means that through proper planning, and adding the right persons to your cause, you can build up to some very effective turns later in the game.<br/><br/>Points are scored for building new stave churches, burning stave churches, founding new villages, igniting beacons and moving your heirs between castles. The game is over when a player has reached a certain number of points, whereupon there is a final score count where you may score extra points depending on how much glory you have gained in battle and what families you have connected to through marriage.<br/><br/>&mdash;description from the designer<br/><br/>",

White Hat comes with separate,  dedicated solo  and  2-player  modes.<br/><br/>As the players attempt to prove their worth, they will attempt to win tricks by playing cards from their hand.

The largest of these, located north of Kiev, erupted on 3 November as infantry and tank units of the 1st Ukrainian Front burst through the German line. Soon Soviet tank columns were racing to the distant towns of Fastov and Zhitomir, mauling several German panzers divisions hastily brought up to stem the Red tide. On 12 November, however, the Germans managed to assemble a powerful striking force centered around the 1st and 1st SS Panzer Divisions, threw them at the overextended formations of the Red Army, and rolled them back. Over the next four weeks the action see-sawed back and forth as reserves were committed and attack followed counterattack.<br/><br/>One side represents the German forces of the 4th Panzer Army while the other side controls the Red Army forces of 1st Ukrainian Front.

        "description": "An abstract race game set on the Mississippi river. Each person has a boat (actually a hexagonal piece with the numbers 1-6 written on each of the 6 sides of the piece). The board is a long track of hexes that wind back and forth in an 'S' pattern. Each person places his 'boat' on the start space with one of the numbers facing forwards. Each person also starts with a number of 'Logs'. These are used to move your boat forward 1 space for each log spent. (You can also decide to move backwards - gaining 1 log for each space moved back).<br/><br/>Now comes the complication - bumping. If your boat stops in a space that is adjacent to 1 or more others, bumping occurs. To determine where your boat ends up you look at the hex sides facing each other (on your boat and on the adjacent one(s)). You subtract the adjacent boat's hex side number from yours - and if it is positive your boat moves forward that number of spaces, and if negative - the other boat moves forward that number of spaces. Now you check to see if your boat is adjacent to another boat and if so repeat the bumping procedure.<br/><br/>If your boat is next to more than 1 boat, and has at least 1 positive difference, your boat moves forward. If you have more than 1 positive, add them together and move forward that distance. If you have a negative difference the other boats move in clockwise order.<br/><br/>For subsequent turns - you can freely change the facing (&amp; thus the hex side number facing forward) by 60 degrees. Moving it further than 1 hexside costs you 1 &quot;log&quot; per extra 60 degree facing change. You then decide whether to move forward or back and resolve any bumping.<br/><br/>The first boat to the finish wins.<br/><br/>",

You will want to remember which tiles go into which bag at the end of the round, dividing duties between one another in order to work out your strategy together as effectively as possible.<br/><br/>Time is always a pressing issue. The cathedral must be completed in the third round at the latest, and if a tile can no longer be placed elsewhere with an action, it must go into the bell tower, with that tower's toll ending the round.<br/><br/>Special highlight: You build a real, three-dimensional cathedral!<br/><br/>",

They earn Glory Points for successful missions as well as for achieving their Secret Goals. In the Secret Goals deck there are also Traitor cards (traitors earn points when missions fail). The game mechanisms also involve an element of bidding (to determinine the first player) and secret Order cards given to the soldiers to enhance their power.

Different options exist for various units (for example, cavalry can be dismounted to create men-at-arms.)<br/><br/>Each game in the PRESTAGS series shares a set of the same common rules.

        "description": "From session report:<br/>A card game. The deck consists of five  different colored sets of cards, each set numbered 1 - 8. There are  also five matching sets of wooden disks, 10 of each color.<br/><br/>The cards are dealt out equally to the players and they alternate playing one card face-up to the table. Unlike a trick-taking game, there is no need to follow suit; players may play any card they desire. If a player lays a card of the same color and a LOWER value as a previously laid card that round, the higher card is turned over and is out of play. When play returns to a player who still has his card face-up in front of him, he collects a number of chips from the stockpile which matches the number and color of the card he played. If his card is face-down, however, he does not collect any chips. In either case, he plays another card and the cycle continues until the players have played all of their cards.<br/><br/>When collecting chips, if the stockpile of a certain color is depleted, the player then steals the required number and color of chips from the opponent who currently possesses the most chips of that color. Thus, each player's collection of chips is constantly in danger of being confiscated by their opponents.<br/><br/>The basic rules call for a number of rounds equal to the number of players, with the player collecting the greatest cumulative total of chips over those rounds being the victor.<br/><br/>",

They've done so side-by-side with fantastical fauna, creatures with a cavernous craving for the choicest of cupcakes. Using sweet treats with the perfect blend of sugar, spice, and everything nice for each species, monster trainers befriend and tame these wild beasts. Feed them too many cupcakes at once, though, and they won't get the sugar rush they crave...but a terrible tummyache instead!<br/><br/>In Creatures and Cupcakes, monster trainers compete to tame two magical creatures to show off to the Cupcake King and Cupcake Queen. The trainer who does this first wins.<br/><br/>In this press-your-luck game, players pull cupcakes out of a bag. Every cupcake you draw advances you a space on each creature's affection track. However, if you draw two of the same in a row, your turn ends immediately. Even going bust has its sweet rewards as that player will get either a special power card with a one-time effect or a medicine card to help keep that monster from overeating next time.<br/><br/>&mdash;description from the publisher<br/><br/>",

Reveal two cards to start two discard piles.<br/><br/>On a turn, pick up the top card of either discard pile or the top of the deck. If you drew from the deck and don't want the card, discard it on top of either pile. If you do want the card, place it in a pile that contains only cards of that color; each player maintains their own set of card piles. Arrange the cards in each pile so that you can see how many cards are in the pile, but not the number or joker symbol on any card but the topmost one. Your goal is to get all five of the numbered cards (1-5) in each color, although a joker can replace any number, giving you bonus points along the way. If you place the fifth card in a pile, claim the matching colored token and place it on top of the pile to show that color is now out of play for you.<br/><br/>When the deck runs out, you re-arrange the cards in each pile into a numerical sequence, and you score points based on the length of the sequence starting with 1. If a sequence has no 1, it's worth 0 points for you! Additionally, each joker in a valid sequence is worth as many points as the length of the sequence. Each colored token you collect is worth as many points as the number of tokens you collect. Whoever uses their memory well to collect valid sequences &mdash; while being cutthroat enough to block their opponent &mdash; wins.<br/><br/>Barakka includes multiple variants that add new cards and tokens to the game.<br/><br/>",

The farm was using specialized Japanese-made machinery that had Kanji characters on them, so Israeli military maps labeled the area as 'Chinese Farm'.[1][2] The battle began when the IDF launched Operation Abiray-Lev (&quot;Stouthearted Men&quot;), attempting to establish a corridor to the canal and allow bridges to be laid for a crossing. Accordingly, the Israelis attacked Egyptian forces in and around the Chinese Farm.<br/><br/>Determined Egyptian resistance made progress extremely slow for the Israelis, who suffered heavy losses. The Israelis were repeatedly reinforced with armor but were unable to make much headway, only managing to seize an important crossroad on the second day. Suffering from a lack of infantry, the Israelis brought up paratroopers during the night of October 16/17. They were tasked with clearing anti-tank defenses for the armor, but they became pinned down by heavy Egyptian fire. The paratroopers drew Egyptian attention long enough for the Israelis to move bridging equipment to the canal undetected. Armored forces later extricated the paratroopers.<br/><br/>The Egyptians attempted to restore their defenses to their initial dispositions with an armored attack on October 17. It initially succeeded, but was pushed back by Israeli counterattacks in an armored battle lasting the entire day. Seriously depleted by the continuous fighting, the Egyptians relinquished control of the routes to the canal, opening them up to the Israelis. The battle is remembered as one of the most costly and brutal battles of the war.<br/><br/>Game Scale:<br/>Game Turn: 12 hours<br/>Hex: .9 miles / 1.5 kilometers<br/>Units: Company to Brigade<br/><br/>Game Inventory:<br/>One 22 x 27&quot; full color map<br/>Two dual-side printed countersheet (480 1/2&quot; counters)<br/>One 16-page Suez '73 rulebook<br/>One 12-page Suez '73 Historical Notes &amp; Scenario Booklet<br/>Two dual-side printed CRT/TEC players aid cards<br/>One single-side printed Turn Record/Israeli Unit Composition players aid card<br/>One single-side printed Egyptian Unit Composition players aid card<br/>One single-side printed Israeli Order of Battle/Reinforcement schedule players aid card<br/>One single-side printed Egyptian Order of Battle/Reinforcement schedule players aid card<br/>One 6-sided die<br/><br/>Solitaire Playability: High<br/>Complexity Level: Medium<br/>Players: 2 or more<br/>Playing Time: 4-15 hours<br/><br/>",

In this first game in the series, each player controls a Union or Confederate force at the Battle of Gettysburg, struggling for The Wheatfield on July 2nd, 1863. Gettysburg: The Wheatfield was carefully crafted to introduce players to system basics of organization, events, maneuver, fire and morale, with future games in this series promising to expand the detail and accuracy of the Tattered Flags system.<br/><br/>Since many players do not have the time, funds or eyesight to paint armies of miniature figures, Tattered Flags comes with colorful cardboard counters, called &ldquo;Stands&rdquo; (in the vernacular of miniatures gaming). These games also use a printed battlefield game map in lieu of miniature trees, hills, buildings, etc. Feel free to substitute miniature figures if desired!<br/><br/>There are three scenarios included in Gettysburg: The Wheatfield, each with its own Order of Battle (OOB), Special Rules, Turn Length and Victory Condition. The first scenario is introductory in complexity and is used when someone is first learning and playing the game. The second scenario is the historical scenario depicting the actual fighting that occurred during the afternoon of July 2nd.

        "description": "Ten Plagues, The Card game is a family game for 2-4 Players based on the Biblical story of the Ten Plagues of Egypt.<br/><br/>In this card game players race to collect sets of cards to complete the pyramid goals, but hurry! Your objectives and your hand of cards may change quickly as the plagues strike. Be the player with the most pyramid points by the end of the game to win.<br/><br/>Players have a hand of ten cards depicting the plagues of Egypt as described in the Torah / Old Testament. Each turn, you'll draw a card from the deck, then discard a card to the tomb. You'll then have an opportunity to complete a goal displayed on a pyramid. Each time a goal is completed, a plague event will be revealed in the same order as the ancient plagues. Each plague event will change each player's hand of cards, usually making you discard specific cards. The game will end after the last plague is revealed and the player with the most pyramid points will be declared the winner.<br/><br/>&mdash;description from the designer<br/><br/>",

Over the ages, Nexus soared to incredible wealth and power. Wandering tribes flocked to the city to worship and learn from the mysterious magicks beneath it.<br/> As Nexus grew, more and more power was drawn from the well. And as more power was drawn, the more unstable the energies of the well became. After millennia of providing Nexus with knowledge and might, the well gave the city something new. Blight.<br/><br/>Beneath Nexus is an asymmetrical dungeon crawling card game for 3 to 6 players. One player acts as the Blight Lord, an evil overlord who corrupted the great city of Nexus centuries ago. All other players play the heroes who have come to Nexus to reclaim it from the powerful Blight Lord.<br/><br/>Beneath Nexus's fantasy theme was inspired by the big tabletop rpgs like D&amp;D, Pathfinder, and Dungeonworld. Players of Magic: the Gathering, Sentinels of the Multiverse, and Lunch Money will recognize the card-based mechanics and gameplay.<br/><br/>We at Silverclutch Games created Beneath Nexus for hobbyist gamers to introduce casual gamers and new players to fantasy adventure. Beneath Nexus can be learned within 10 minutes and is both competitive and cooperative with its one vs many format. Hobbyist gamers will find the unique heroes and Blight Lords engaging and challenging to master due to variable player powers, difficult dungeon cards, and the vast array of monsters to combat with their own unique abilities.<br/><br/>",

But the competition is fierce, and those who aren't finding enough are up above interfering with the competition's radio reception. It takes a few cards to make sure that your salvage mission proceeds without incident. Up to 60 treasures are sunk on the game board and the players must try to raise as many different ones as they can. The first player to fill the storage bay of their ship or who has the most treasures at the end of the game is the winner. Cards are used to move the submarines, raise treasure, and interfere with radio reception.<br/><br/>",

Travel in the Antarctic is not easy, however, and for some trips, you even need a license to get in.<br/><br/>Neko Harbour: The Card Game is a strategy card game for 2-4 players. Each game lasts two periods, and each period comes with a mid-game scoring. Each period consists of two phases: the drafting phase and the action phase.<br/><br/>During the drafting phase, players take cards from the display until they have six cards in hand.<br/><br/>During the action phase, players take turns playing a card from hand to build a preparation line until all cards have been played. With these cards, players can get resources, move ships, trigger special actions, and (probably) take free actions.<br/><br/>The most intriguing part of the game is that players need to build the preparation line with cards and create ideal combinations between the cards as  cards create a hub that provides players with a bonus when ships arrive at it. Additionally, players should acquire enough licences for their journey to go smoothly. After two periods, the player who has the most penguin points wins and is clearly the one who saw the most penguins in the Antarctic.<br/><br/>&mdash;description from the designer<br/><br/>",

        "description": "A game of modern tank battles based on the book Team Yankee by Harold Coyle.  Rules use a programmed-learning approach through eight scenarios and also include instructions on creating your own scenarios.<br/><br/>From the Game Box:<br/><br/>&quot;Here is hands-on experience leading a modern tank company into battle.  Team Yankee presents the expertise that the modern tank company commander needs in easy-to-follow game rules format.  Two players each form their own strategies as they fight out potential, very real situations on the battlefield of World War III.  Soviet units have numbers and firepower; U.S. units have speed and technology.  To each side's advantages and disadvantages the players add strategy and leadership.<br/><br/>Rules cover the essentials of movement and combat between modern combat units.  On this foundation are built special rules covering artillery, morale, chemical warfare, air support, and the other special aspects of modern warfare.<br/><br/>The game maps cover the same ground shown in the novel.  Eight game scenarios walk you through the rules, unveiling the effects of all the rules, and showing you in detail how to play the game.  In the course of playing the scenarios, you will be able to recreate the situations in the book (and perhaps alter their course).<br/><br/>The rules chapter on variants lets players change the scenarios to add new rules and replay scenarios to see what effects they will have on the situation.  The rules chapter on new scenarios lets players build their own forces and fight out totally new battles.&quot;<br/><br/>",

The Keep is home to a dragon, and it is up to the players, with luck and timing, to overcome the dangers, collect some treasure and escape from the Keep before the sun sets and the vampires go hunting.<br/><br/>This edition features streamlined rules, for example pre-placed one-use event tiles (placed onto the room tiles) instead of the players drawing room cards each time they enter a room. Door cards, trap cards, search cards, corpse cards and chest cards have been rationalized; all is now contained on the room tiles. Undefeated monsters and certain traps now stay on the board, and the game features a slightly more complex and tactical fighting system. The game allows for co-operative play, and even the dragon herself can be killed.<br/><br/>Re-implements:<br/><br/>    DungeonQuest<br/><br/><br/>",

As Sir Roger's guest, I thought you might be interested in some information about the mansion and, perhaps, about the other guests that will be present during your stay. I have enclosed a brief biography of each guest. Watersdown Mansion is an old, elegant stone building situated in Yorkshire, England, and constructed in 1817. The original owner, Lord Balmy Farfrummit, made his fortune selling English pig iron to the French after Bonaparte's defeat in 1815. Roger Watersdown acquired the entire Farfrummit holdings in 1925 after the tragic death of Viscount Farfrummit aboard his sailing yacht, Frummit's Ferry, which foundered during a fierce storm off Falmouth Harbor. Sir Roger, as you may know, is the principal shareholder of the giant conglomerate Watersdown Beverages Ltd., and known far and wide as a jovial host. Female guests are cautioned that Sir Roger, after consumption of his customary evening cocktails, tends to become something of a leech. I welcome you on behalf of Sir Roger and the entire Watersdown Mansion household, and I hope your stay will be a pleasant one.<br/><br/>CHARACTERS<br/>Dr. Malcom K.T. Praktiss, Miranda T. Shetes, Roger S.B. Astird, Dame Allison Bigh, Prosper Alvin Bates Esq., Donald J. Brooks, Florence Wing Brooks, Eiaguielle R. Aminmund<br/><br/>",
