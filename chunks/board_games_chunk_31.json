        "description": "The Forest of the Dead is a shadowy realm that lies between worlds. It is a place where the dead from all worlds roam freely amongst the ancient and decayed trees. A cold, thick fog hangs in the air, and the gnarled branches gently sway and clack in the fetid breeze. The forest floor is covered in a spongy moss, and the soft black soil beneath hides the countless bones and treasures of untold eons. It is difficult not to feel utterly alone in the stillness of the woods, but the creatures of the forest know you are here. They are hungry for the fleeting warmth that only life carries, and they desire above all else revenge upon the living!<br/><br/>This Deluxe OtherWorld Expansion allows your Heroes to explore the haunted Forest of the Dead, battling Undead versions of virtually any Enemies you have in your collection, as well as a host of new and terrifying creatures that roam the shadowy woods!<br/><br/>Like all OtherWorlds, The Forest of the Dead has a set of unique Encounters, Artifacts, Map Cards, and OtherWorld Threat cards, as well as a couple of Global Rules that make adventuring there more distinct. The Global Rules are listed on the World Card included in this expansion. While exploring the Forest of the Dead, Heroes will find themselves picking their way through densely packed decayed trees and crumbling stone ruins, shining their lantern&rsquo;s light through the cold fog that hangs in the air. Many have found their way into the dark Forest, whether through death or gateway, but few ever find their way back out.<br/><br/>&mdash;description from the publisher<br/><br/>",

Imperial medical colleges were built, state examinations for doctors were held, and the &ldquo;Materia Medica&rdquo;, a complete medical encyclopedia, with text and illustrations about almost one thousand medical substances, was released during the period. The search for the elixir of everlasting life, another recurrent topic through all of Chinese imperial history, continued during these years.<br/><br/>The Herbalist character is inspired by a Chinese herbal medicine student. She may use her herbs token to give new life to other characters in play and so using their abilities any time she wants. On the other side she allows the player to gain a lot of coins if there are special temple tiles in her line of sight at the end of the game. She is a very powerful character, but be aware: her ability is limited by the number of tokens available and you need to pass one turn to regain them all.<br/><br/>&mdash;blurb from the back of the box<br/><br/>A multi-language limited edition promotional character for Tang Garden.<br/><br/>Including:<br/><br/><br/>     The Herbalist Miniature<br/>     The Herbalist Character Card<br/>     3 Wooden tokens with heat transfer for herbs<br/>     1 Special Scenario<br/>     Tuckbox for storage<br/><br/><br/>&mdash;description from the publisher<br/><br/>",

It is based on a map of containing England, parts of Wales and Scottland, less of the north and southwest compared to the full 1822 map.<br/><br/>Players take the part of investors in Railway companies and then operate the companies to maximise their own wealth.<br/><br/>Three variants of the 1822 Medium Regional Scenario are given in the rules. The Starter version is intended for those with no experience with 1822. The Standard version is intended for players that wish to experience gameplay similar to the full 1822 game, but in a shorter duration. The Advanced version is more volatile and is the same as the previously web-published variant made available upon 1822&rsquo;s release.<br/><br/>Private companies per variant:<br/><br/>Starter: Use P1 - P14<br/>Standard: Use P1, P4 - P16, P18<br/>Advanced: Use P1 - P12<br/><br/>The rules are available on the publisher's site.<br/><br/>",

        "description": "The Great Spring Offensive<br/>Vietnam, 1975. The Provisional Revolutionary Government was ready. After internal debate, the Communists had issued Resolution 21&mdash;the war to unify the country would continue. The Paris Peace would serve as merely one more tool in the armed struggle. In Saigon, President Thieu had known from the beginning that the ceasefire was an empty promise, but he had to accept his US ally&rsquo;s hollow accords with the North. Nonetheless, he now fielded one of the world&rsquo;s best equipped armies, and the victories of 1972 proved to him that it could withstand even an all-out assault from the North. While President Nixon had pledged peace with honor, his determination to enforce South Vietnam&rsquo;s independence had floundered amidst the worst US presidential scandal in history. What now from Ford? From Hanoi, Le Duc Tho&mdash;the negotiator who had squared off against Kissinger in Paris&mdash;was to trek south to oversee the final push to Saigon on behalf of the Politburo. His orders: &ldquo;Do not come home until victory is won.&rdquo;<br/><br/>Mark Herman and Volko Ruhnke&rsquo;s award-winning Fire in the Lake revealed the factional clashes of the US insurgency in Vietnam, from the first entry of US combat troops under Westmoreland to the &rsquo;72 Christmas bombings that teed up their negotiated withdrawal. Now, Fall of Saigon expands Fire in the Lake to finish the story. Three Fall of Saigon scenarios enable 1-4 players to extend play beyond Paris, beginning before 1968&rsquo;s Tet, on the eve of the 1972 Easter Offensive, or from 1964 all the way to the end of the war. A standalone 2‑player Black April scenario focuses tightly on the post-Paris sparring between NVA and ARVN, including the final massive battles, advances, and retreats.<br/><br/>To show the transition from insurgency and counterinsurgency to mobile mechanized warfare, Fall of Saigon introduces an array of new features, including:<br/><br/><br/>     Paris Peace Talks that may result in either US or NVA Retreat&mdash;or both.<br/>     A building US Anti-War Movement and Northern War Weariness penalizing the continued campaigns.<br/>     US Posture that players influence to allow anything from full-bore US economic and financial backing of ARVN&rsquo;s defense and even a return of US heavy bombers over the North to utter abandonment of South Vietnam.<br/>     Hard-hitting NVA and ARVN Armor units capable of lightning Spearhead actions and of capturing the enemy&rsquo;s vehicles to turn around for their own use in the next attack.<br/>     Head-to-head action, NVA versus ARVN, using the acclaimed 2-player Initiative system from COIN Series Volume VII, Colonial Twilight, by Brian Train.<br/>     72 new Event cards for 1973-1975 and four new Pivotal Events to portray the political struggles in Washington, Hanoi, and Saigon; the building conventional military capabilities of the combatants; NVA probes and ARVN counterthrusts; threatened US enforcement of the Accords by air; and the chaos of the final collapse.<br/>     For solitaire players, Fall of Saigon introduces the popular new card-based Non-player system from Bruce Mansfield, designer of COIN Series Volume IX, Gandhi.<br/><br/><br/>Fall of Saigon will include 79 Event, Pivotal Event, and Coup cards; about 30 Non-player cards; one sheet of counters and track tiles; about 20 added wooden pieces; new and updated player aid charts; and expansion rule and play booklets. Fire in the Lake veterans will find the war beyond Paris easy to rev up but a whole new experience.<br/><br/>A copy of Fire in the Lake will be necessary to play the Fall of Saigon expansion.<br/><br/>COMPONENTS<br/><br/>    79 playing cards (Fall of Saigon Events, Coups, Pivotals - S1 to S79).<br/>    25 tarot-sized playing cards (FoS solitaire system).<br/>    24 wooden pieces (9 Red, 15 yellow)<br/>    4 identical double-sided color 11x17&rdquo; cards (FoS Faction sheets).<br/>    2 identical double-sided color 8&frac12;x11&rdquo; cards (FoS Coup Round and Paris Peace sheets).<br/>    2 different double-sided color 11x17&rdquo; cards (FoS Non-Player Coup Round).<br/>    2 different double-sided color 8&frac12;x11&rdquo; cards (FoS Non-Player Aid).<br/>    1 Countersheet (US Policy tile, Initiative track tile, 39 Fall of Saigon counters).<br/>    Expansion Rules booklet<br/>    Playbook booklet<br/>    Solitaire (Tay Son) Rules and Reference booklet<br/>    Game Box<br/><br/><br/> <br/>Errata components also included for Fire in the Lake:<br/><br/>    2 counters<br/>    1 Playing card (solitaire system - US card B)<br/><br/><br/>(from GMT website and user's description)<br/><br/>",

With new unit types, a rulebook with four new scenarios, new cards, new commanders, and even more, this expansion will bring greater variety to your Battles of Westeros experience and awesome power to your House&rsquo;s cause!<br/><br/>Ally yourself with three new commanders, sworn to protect the smallfolk against all who would harm them: Lord Beric Dondarrion, Anguy &quot;the Archer&quot;, and Thoros of Myr. Dubbed the &quot;Lightning Lord&quot;, Beric's sigil is a forked lightning bolt, and his weapon a flaming sword. Swift in battle, he is a leader who will stand against any enemy. Anguy is an archer with a reputation across Westeros for devastating accuracy and can avoid capture by using his surroundings to his advantage. The red priest of R'hllor, Thoros of Myr, is a formidable warrior but his greatest strength is in his ability to assist his fallen Brotherhood members...<br/><br/>The Brotherhood units continue the Battles of Westeros trend of representing ally forces with tan-colored miniatures. However, unlike all other Battles of Westeros sets, Brotherhood Without Banners does not include any banner or pole components, as these outlaw warriors neither answer to a liege lord nor ride under any flag. These units do not follow normal activation rules and are controlled through a new mechanism: Brotherhood tokens.<br/><br/>This expansion also features new thematic keywords, such as Call to Arms and Scrapper. Call to Arms represents the Brotherhood's ability to incite the local peasantry to take up arms and join them on the battlefield. Scrapper is attributed to units who are stubborn and hardy fighters, aggressive even when defending.<br/><br/>",

The one naval battle has its own rule book.<br/><br/>The scenario book features 20 battles presented in a chronological order that traces the evolution of the Roman military system from early battles against various foreign foes, Caesar&rsquo;s wars in Gaul followed by Caesar&rsquo;s wars against his Roman rivals, and culminating with the Roman invasion of Britain a century later.<br/><br/>Battles Included:<br/><br/>Rise of the Roman Warlords - Marius and Sulla<br/><br/>    Cirta 106 BCE (Jugurtha)<br/>    Vercellae 101 BCE (Dictator)<br/>    Chaeronea 86 BCE (Dictator)<br/><br/><br/>Caesar&rsquo;s Gallic Wars<br/><br/>    Bibracte 58 BCE (COG) <br/>    The Rhine 58 BCE (COG)<br/>    The Sabis 57 BCE (COG)<br/>    Bay of Biscay 56 BCE (COG)<br/>    Britannia 55 BCE (COG)<br/>    Lutetia 52 BCE (COG) <br/>    Gergovia 52 BCE (Gergovia)<br/><br/><br/>Caesar&rsquo;s Civil Wars<br/><br/>    Dyrrachium 48 BCE (TCW)<br/>    Lesnikia 48 BCE (TCW)<br/>    Pharsalus 48 BCE (TCW)<br/>    Nicopolis 48 BCE (Veni, Vidi, Vici)<br/>    Zela 47 BCE (Veni, Vidi, Vici)<br/>    Ruspina 46 BCE (TCW)<br/>    Thapsus 46 BCE (TCW)<br/>    Munda 45 BCE (TCW) <br/><br/><br/>Roman Conquest of Britannia <br/><br/>    The Medway 43 CE (Caratacus)<br/>    Wales 51 CE (Caratacus)<br/><br/><br/>Components:<br/><br/>    7 1&frasl;2 Counter Sheets (1&frasl;2&rdquo; - 280 per sheet) -&gt; 2,100 counters<br/>    Six 22&rdquo; X 34&rdquo; back printed maps<br/>    One 11&rdquo; x 17&rdquo; back printed map<br/>    Four 11&rdquo; x &ldquo;17 Charts and Tables PAC (two for each player)<br/>    One 8 1&frasl;2&rdquo; x 11&rdquo; Turn Record and Rout Point Tracks Display<br/>    One 8 1&frasl;2&rdquo; x 11&rdquo; Naval Charts and Tables PAC<br/>    Rules Book (48 pages, w/color)<br/>    Naval Rules Book (12 pages, w/color)<br/>    Scenario Book (80 pages, w/color)<br/>    One ten-sided die<br/>    Two six-sided die<br/><br/><br/>&mdash;description from the publisher<br/><br/>",

At the same time, you'll find the bold intelligence agents of the Rebel Alliance and independent Smugglers and Spies slicing in to sabotage the operation. Meanwhile, on the planet Ruusan, Jedi and Imperial Inquistitors clash over the power of the Force nexus hidden inside the Valley of the Jedi.<br/><br/>In the &quot;Echoes of the Force&quot; cycle, Star Wars: The Card Game experiences dramatic changes taking shape as both sides learn to better channel the power of the Force. Its balance has implications that reach far beyond damaging dark side objectives or advancing the Death Star dial. The living Force binds all things, and it may soon permeate every part of your decks, drawing strength from the new cards included in Heroes and Legends and other Force Packs from &quot;Echoes of the Force&quot;.<br/><br/>Contains objective sets 97-101.<br/><br/>",

Rather than introducing completely new ships to the game, this expansion follows in the vein of the Rebel Aces Expansion Pack and the Heroes of the Resistance Expansion Pack by introducing new versions of existing ships already in the service of the Rebel Alliance. In this case, you'll find two new ship miniatures: a U-wing and a T-65 X-wing, both pre-painted in the stunning red-and-white paint scheme of Saw Gerrera's freedom fighters.<br/><br/>Though the ships may be functionally the same as the ones included in previous expansions, the Saw's Renegades Expansion Pack offers an assortment of ship cards featuring pilots from Saw's motley band of warriors &mdash; or even Saw Gerrera himself, flying his powerful U-wing into your battles. Along with new ship cards for both the T-65 X-wing and the U-wing, you'll find an arsenal of fifteen new upgrade cards, equipping your squadrons with any number of unusual tactics or system upgrades.<br/><br/>&mdash;description from the publisher<br/><br/>",

The saboteur has struck again... but who is the saboteur?<br/><br/>Can you and your fellow miners build a path to the hidden gold, or will the saboteurs thwart your efforts? You&rsquo;ll have to overcome cave-ins, broken lanterns, and busted pickaxes, along with special action cards that let other miners steal your gold and swap their identity. But the key bonus features in this set are team play and new characters who add competing motives -- some help the miners, some aid the saboteurs, and one is more interested in crystals than gold.<br/><br/>This bonus pack includes everything from the original game and the Saboteur 2 Expansion Pack, plus a collectors&rsquo; card that introduces a devious special character. With its unique combination of cooperation and betrayal, Saboteur reveals new secrets every time it&rsquo;s played. So whether you dig into the original game, add on the expansion pack, or mine the possibilities of the collectors' card,  with this Saboteur bundle you've hit the mother lode of treasure and treachery.<br/><br/>&mdash;description from the back of the box<br/><br/>",

When he enters play, he is sideways, filling 2 spaces (his color is considered green).  If there aren&rsquo;t 2 free adjacent spaces due to Buddha or Ghosts, Jean-Claude makes space next to a free space by discarding what is there (no curse/reward for ghost; can't eliminate an incarnation).<br/><br/>To defeat him, players must break both his legs: his left leg has a 3 Blue resistance and his right 4 Green (his right leg is stronger).<br/>An exorcism must be successful on each of his two legs (the order has no importance). When one of his legs is broken, he moves fully on to the space for the remaining leg, leaving an open space.<br/><br/>When both of his legs are broken, he is discarded and gives an apple to the active player (this reward is an artifact).  An apple is good for the body and it&rsquo;s full of pectin, but it can spoil!  During his Yang Phase, the player can discard the apple to return any Taoist (including himself) to 3 QI.

Designed by Rainer &Aring;hlfors and Andrei Novac, it marks a significant step in the Exodus universe!<br/><br/>Exodus: Event Horizon is fully enjoyable when integrated with just the base game of Exodus: Proxima Centauri, but it also works great along with Edge of Extinction, the previously released first expansion for Exodus. Even though all ten modules herein are compatible with one another and can be used together, each represents a new or enhanced experience. While some modules integrate seamlessly, others will surprise and engage you in brand new modes of play.<br/><br/>The expansion also contains two scenarios that provide brand new ways to enjoy the game, including both cooperative and semi-cooperative game modes, a flexible solo-mode, and a scenario that introduces timed game events.<br/><br/>Module Summary<br/><br/><br/><br/>    <br/>         Bonus Actions<br/><br/>         M1<br/><br/>         This module adds additional Bonus Action cards as options in your games.<br/><br/>    <br/>    <br/>         Centaurian Resistance<br/><br/>         M2<br/><br/>         The Resistance fleets have been reimagined to better scale in both threat and reward throughout the game.<br/><br/>    <br/>    <br/>         Centaurian Outposts<br/><br/>         M3<br/><br/>         Centaurians are actively defending their planets against players who exploit their valuable resources.<br/><br/>    <br/>    <br/>         Exploration<br/><br/>         M4<br/><br/>         Surprising events and sudden dangers await those brave enough to explore the unknown worlds.<br/><br/>    <br/>    <br/>         New Planets<br/><br/>         M5<br/><br/>         New and exotic planets provide even more variety and choices as you expand the reach of your faction.<br/><br/>    <br/>    <br/>         Proxima Centauri<br/><br/>         M6<br/><br/>         Our home star makes an appearance in the game and impacts the planetary system with solar wind.<br/><br/>    <br/>    <br/>         Jump Gates<br/><br/>         M7<br/><br/>         Utility structures suitable for both strategic and tactical use as well as emergency response.<br/><br/>    <br/>    <br/>         Communication Satellites<br/><br/>         M8<br/><br/>         With a strong communication network, your ships will gain an advantage away from home.<br/><br/>    <br/>    <br/>         Energy Barriers<br/><br/>         M9<br/><br/>         Natural pockets of energy which can be both a hindrance and a boon.<br/><br/>    <br/>    <br/>         Leaders<br/><br/>         M10<br/><br/>         Employ powerful leaders and benefit from their unique strengths.<br/><br/>    <br/><br/><br/>Scenario Summary<br/><br/><br/><br/>    <br/>         Centaurian Stronghold<br/><br/>         Multi-Player,<br/>Fully Cooperative<br/><br/>         Challenging game mode where the players must work together to eliminate a Centaurian Stronghold megastructure while fighting against relentless waves of Centaurian Warship Squadrons that pursue player ships. No combat takes place between players in the fully cooperative game mode.<br/><br/>    <br/>    <br/>         Multi-Player,<br/>Semi-Cooperative<br/><br/>         Most of the scenario rules remain the same in the semi-cooperative game mode. The players can still collectively lose the game if they fail to eliminate the Centaurian Stronghold. However, both the Stronghold itself and the Warship Squadrons are slightly less deadly. On the other hand, they players are also competing against each other as normal.<br/><br/>    <br/>    <br/>         Solitaire<br/><br/>         True solitaire game mode where you can enjoy the full Exodus experience, with or without whatever expansion content you like.<br/><br/>    <br/>    <br/>         Event Horizon<br/><br/>         Multi-Player,<br/>Competitive<br/><br/>         New challenge mode where the players must attempt to score the most victory points before the planetary neighborhood of Proxima Centauri becomes uninhabitable.

It goes especially well with Waiting for Santa, but you don't need WFS to enjoy Santa's Revenge. It adds Santa monsters like Harold Angel (as in, HARK!) and the Anti-Clause. And it gives you new things to hit those monsters with, from Snowballs to the North Pole. And the new Armor is Christmas Wrapping. John Kovalic had fun drawing this one. (Actually, he had fun with them all. You can tell by looking. You'll have fun too.)<br/><br/>This is an expansion for Munchkin, not a stand-alone set.

In reaction, a groundswell of unified outrage has risen up from below, allowing Runners to fight back from directions never seen before. As these conflicts run their course, hope begins to permeate New Angeles. Some take solace that the citadel of the Beanstalk did not fall, others breathe easy as the corporate grip loosens. It&rsquo;s a new world, and everything is on the table.<br/><br/>Things are looking up.<br/><br/>This is the second fan expansion for Android: Netrunner released by NISEI, and the final part of the Ashes cycle.<br/><br/>",

No loyal servant of the Imperium could fathom how many Tomb Worlds still lie dormant, only awaiting some mysterious signal to rise and spread doom across the civilised worlds. Now, as the Necrons ascend and swell their armies with slaves, all the Traxis sector will learn to fear these mechanical terrors.<br/><br/>Legions of Death introduces the Necrons as a new playable faction for Warhammer 40,000: Conquest. Two new warlords lead the Necron forces in the Traxis sector, and new mechanics evoke the theme of a Necron invasion whenever you lead them into battle. As the Necrons, you can enslave the peoples of the galaxy, filling your deck with units from other factions that are forced to fight alongside you. Although the Necrons hold the spotlight in this deluxe expansion, you&rsquo;ll also find a new unit for each of the other eight factions alongside new neutral cards that promise to impact the game in entirely new ways!<br/><br/>",

        "description": "This expansion includes two survivors and their Zombivor counterparts both designed by Adrian Smith.<br/><br/>Adrian Smith (born 1969 in England, United Kingdom) is a illustrator/concept designer living in Scotland. Best known for his work with Games Workshop and numerous similar companies, Adrian has also done concept design work for computer games companies such as THQ and EA. Other credits include a short comic series in France written by Pat Mills and book illustrations alongside renowned artists from around the world. Recently Adrian has been self publishing, the first project being his art book &quot;Illuminations&quot;, and plans are in motion for a series of comics early in 2013. In addition to these personal projects, he still finds time for freelance work with various companies.&quot;<br/><br/>The two survivors include:<br/><br/>Padre Johnson<br/><br/>Padre Johnson led his small flock during the early days of the apocalypse, until they were finally, inevitably overrun.  The Padre was the only survivor, miraculously emerging unscathed from the ruins of his church.  Now he spreads the good Word amongst the survivors, albeit slightly unhinged from his narrow escape from death.  Still he's handy with a shotgun and a quick prayer, and is always a welcome sight.<br/><br/>Bones<br/><br/>Bones is (or was) the lead guitarist of a heavy metal band famous the world over... but lately things have been getting a little stale.  World tours, sell out stadiums, groupies, even the drugs and booze just weren't that fun anymore.  In his darkest and most sober moments, Bones knew he hadn't really done anything creative for the best part of a decade - just rehashing the same old thing over and over....<br/><br/>The zombie apocalypse changed all that of course, and ironically Bones is now incredibly inspired to create songs about death, blood and liberation!  Unfortunately, electricity is hard to come by so he's perfecting his strictly acoustic metal for now.<br/><br/>",

        "description": "War in Europe is a compendium of three modules, War in the East 2nd ed., War in the West, and War in Europe. The two base games, War in the East 2nd ed. and War in the West, are both playable individually and are both designed for two sided play. War in Europe provides an integrated linkage between these two and provides for three player play.<br/><br/>The game system traces its lineage from SPI's earlier Kursk and Destruction of Army Group Centre but was primarily inspired by War in the  East 1st. ed.  War in Europe is played on nine full sized (22&quot;x34&quot;) coloured  maps and employs about 3600 1/2x1/2&quot; cardboard pieces.<br/><br/>The three sides in the full game are the Italo-German Axis, the Anglo- French-American Allies, and the Soviet Union. Political rules govern the  alignment of neutral states and restrict the use of active minor power units  by the controlling players. Rules also restrict the degree of co-operation between units of differing nationalities, whether Axis or Allied. The victory  conditions are also constructed to limit the degree of co-operation between  independent Allied and Soviet players.<br/><br/>Each 3/4&quot; hex represents 20 miles. A single game-turn consists of three sequential player turns and represents one week elapsed time. Four game- turns form a 'cycle' at the beginning of which strategic warfare and economic production takes place. Thirteen cycles form a game year. Both Axis and Soviet power produce additional forces via a simplified economic  production process. Allied forces are received only by a preset reinforcement schedule.<br/><br/>Player pieces called units represent division and brigade sized military formations. In addition to units, all powers also possess air-point counters representing abstract air power at an estimated scale of 500 sorties per point. Markers are a third category of playing piece used to note some temporary alteration to the map or to a unit.<br/><br/>Allied and Axis powers have amphibious point counters representing invasion lift assets. Each amphibious point is capable of lifting a single divisional sized unit and as acting as a 'beachhead' supply source. The Axis powers also have counters for Naval Transport points and Naval Surface Combat points. The Axis may build these points via his production routines.<br/><br/>Naval points (of all types) risk interception and elimination (along with any transported unit) by air power when used to transport land units, enable  supply, or provide escort. Axis naval points also risk Allied naval interception and elimination when conducting transport operations on the high seas (anywhere other than the Baltic). The Allied player has a  standard number of naval transport points (15) that does not change from turn to turn and which cannot be destroyed when intercepted, though their cargo may be. Expended (not destroyed) amphibious points are automatically returned to play after a nine turn delay.<br/><br/>The Soviet power possesses one transport point in the Baltic so long as Leningrad remains uncaptured and one naval transport point in the Black Sea so long as the Soviet retains at least one Black Sea port. If the Soviets ever lose their naval transport capability in either sea then it is lost for the rest of the game and cannot be restored.<br/><br/>The Axis power possesses counters for sub points and markers for land fortifications (the Atlantic Wall). Both of these must be produced using the economic system employed during the strategic inter-phase conducted at the start of each cycle. Sub points are used to determine the rate of Allied reinforcement and are themselves subject to loss.<br/><br/>The Allied power receives Strategic Bomber Points which are used to disable Axis Production and Transportation during the Strategic Inter- phase. These are subject to loss by German Strategic Air Defence air- points and Flak Points.<br/><br/>A number of scenarios are provided covering the entire war or significant campaigns. Victory is determined by the Axis political point total and the possession of specified hexes. The Axis political point total is adjusted during the game based on Allied and Axis actions together with the control of specific hexes or the conquest/occupation/liberation of nations. A novel feature in the design is the use of varying CRTs by nation/year to account for the changing relationships in the combat power of units over the course of a six year war without recourse to replacement counters for the units.<br/><br/>The original game was issued in SPI notorious 'flat-pack' plastic tray packaging that required three units to contain the product.

Even before the town blew and the portals began to open, the gold rush and Dark Stone rush that grew the town out of control also lured in Outlaws and bandits by the thousands. Once the devastation occurred and the Darkness came, countless numbers of those Outlaws fell into shadow. Some became Mutants, other fell to the curse of the Lycan or began dabbling into dark Magiks, and many more began to rise from the grave as Undead. It wasn't long before the Undead Outlaws fell back into their old ways of robbing, rustling, and mayhem. Perhaps it was just faint memories of their old lives seeping back in, or maybe they have a cold purpose, with a mind for revenge on the land of the living.<br/><br/>The most famous of all is a dark, rotting figure known only as The Undead Gunslinger. Whoever he was in life, no one can say for sure. But in death, he has become the most cold killer in the land, earning the nickname of the 'Fastest Dead in the West'. He travels the roads and shadows, challenging any who cross his path to a duel. Few survive to tell the tale. Feared for his quick draw, his cold silence, and his sinister stare, The Undead Gunslinger is an unstoppable force, back from hell and hungry for revenge!<br/><br/>Shadows of Brimstone: Undead Gunslinger and Undead Outlaws Deluxe Enemy Set contains everything you need to add sinister Undead Outlaws and the legendary Undead Gunslinger to your games of Shadows of Brimstone! Included are 6 Undead Outlaw models and 1 Undead Gunslinger model, the 2 large Enemy Record Sheets for them, a host of new cards themed around these ghastly outlaws that have come back from the grave for revenge - including all the the Threat Cards needed to add them to your games, and 2 new Missions focusing on these deadly new Enemies!<br/><br/>",

When the resonating horde of Dark Stone blew Brimstone off the map, it released waves of Void energy across the land, tainting the earth and mutating man and beast alike! The Dark Stone Hydra is one such creation; a common rattlesnake, found throughout the deserts of the Southwest, grown massive by the twisting powers of the Dark Stone!  With multiple hissing heads, spiked Dark Stone shards protruding from its body, and a brutal Dark Stone rattle, these savage beasts are a terror beyond imagining, made all the more frightening by their common appearance throughout the region.<br/><br/>The Dark Stone Hydra is a gigantic and terrifying beast! It is not only massive, but also fast and deadly as it strikes, slithering between models to change targets and snapping with all of its fanged heads! The Dark Stone Radiation that taints this creature also exudes from its body, corrupting those that stray too close, and its ability to regenerate damage offsets the fact that it loses power as you cut off its heads. This Enemy Pack contains everything you need to add the savagely giant Dark Stone Hydra to your games of Shadows of Brimstone!

        "description": "Description from the publisher:<br/><br/>The M&ucirc;makil is the first Adventure Pack in the Haradrim cycle for The Lord of the Rings: The Card Game.<br/><br/>After surviving their first adventures amid The Sands of Harad, several of Middle-earth's greatest heroes find themselves surrounded by enemies and stranded far from home. Now, with The M&ucirc;makil and the Haradrim cycle, these heroes embark upon the harrowing homeward journey. No roads guide their way, yet they must travel more than five-hundred miles from Far Harad back to the safety of Gondor, along a route that will lead them straight through some of the world's strangest and most dangerous lands.<br/><br/>What will come of their travels? As it leads us into the Haradrim cycle, The M&ucirc;makil establishes our heroes' plight and their ambitions. With hundreds of miles of hostile territory between them and their destination, the heroes must be cautious and alert, and they must think carefully about how best to prepare themselves for their journey. So it is that in The M&ucirc;makil we find the heroes heading into the jungles of Harad in order to capture Oliphaunts to serve them as mounts.<br/><br/>Meanwhile, in addition to the many dangers and surprises of its scenario, The M&ucirc;makil introduces a new hero and three copies each of nine different player cards that develop the cycle's focus on new partnerships. You'll find powerful events that require you to build your fellowship around paired Traits, as well as the opportunity to make allies with some of the Haradrim, themselves.<br/><br/>",

Players now work together as teams to try to become the wealthiest bandits in the Wild West, and what's better than a second train containing precious documents to spice up the adventure? As soon as they hear this, our famous bandits do not hesitate for a second, jumping from train to train to try to steal these documents on top of everything else up for grabs &mdash; but the shotguns roam wild and the Gatling on the roof does not bode well. On top of everything else, bandits have to be back on the starting train at the end of the last round if they want a chance to win.<br/><br/>This expansion introduces a new 3D train with special cars, two new bandits (Misty and the Twinz, each with new powers), a double team mode with the possibility of betraying your team or not, and an AI Bandit, Il Professore, to allow you to play with an odd number of players and a new action card to nudge a bandit from your team.<br/><br/>",

The world of tomorrow. It took a few decades to set aside our differences. In the end, we stood together as a united nation, and took a step into the future. This is the Age of Steam!<br/><br/>Everyday life has been changed, and we offer an American dream to anyone willing to brave new frontiers. Railroads run by the biggest trains connect most cities, making travel fast and secure. Prosperity helps engineers create the most daring inventions. And going West will offer even more opportunities. Wild territories, vast resources: a better life! Steam carries us to these promising lands, protects us against all perils, and heralds a new dawn for civilization.<br/><br/>And yet...<br/><br/>Yet, rumors talk about frontier towns being erased from the map, of people going mad and hurling themselves into murderous rages. Is it some kind of exotic illness? Who knows, and honestly, who cares? You cannot stop progress. Full steam, in the name of science!<br/><br/>Gears &amp; Guns is a campaign expansion. This means its ten missions form a single ongoing story that the Survivors experience, accumulating experience, skills, and equipment as they go. Their actions and choices each Mission may have dire ramifications down the line.<br/><br/>",

Unfortunately the citizens have some pretty big demands: jobs, a theme park, a couple of cheese factories and maybe even a radio tower. A tough proposition since the city currently consists of a wheat field, a bakery and a single die.<br/><br/>Armed only with your trusty die and a dream, you must grow Machi Koro into the largest city in the region. You will need to collect income from developments, build public works, and steal from your neighbors' coffers. Just make sure they aren't doing the same to you!<br/><br/>Machi Koro is a fast-paced game for 2-4 players. Each player wants to develop the city on his own terms in order to complete all of the landmarks under construction faster than his rivals. On his turn, each player rolls one or two dice. If the sum of the dice rolled matches the number of a building that a player owns, he gets the effect of that building; in some cases opponents will also benefit from your die (just as you can benefit from theirs). Then, with money in hand a player can build a landmark or a new building, ideally adding to the wealth of his city on future turns. The first player to construct all of his landmarks wins!<br/><br/>The Machi Koro: Harbor Expansion injects further excitement into the game that has everyone talking! Want even more fun in your box?! Perhaps ten new establishments, one new starting establishment and two new landmarks will help?<br/><br/>",

Invent your own zany two-word products &ndash; Rumor Mirror! Burp Balloon! &ndash; and sell them to all types of wacky customers. If the round's customer buys your product, you win!<br/><br/>To set up Snake Oil: Party Potion, each player takes six purple word cards. The customer for the round draws a customer card and announces it. Inventors quickly combine two purple word cards from their hand to form a crazy new product to sell to that customer. When ready, each inventor quickly pitches his or her product directly to the customer. The customer can end any pitch that goes longer than thirty seconds.

        "description": "Barbarian is a tactical simulation of combat between the armies of Rome and her early barbarian foes, the Samnites and Gauls, from 315-200 B.C. To play Barbarian, you will need the game SPQR for maps, basic rules, and some counters. Barbarian can also be played with the Simple Great Battles of History Rules.<br/><br/>As Rome strove to conquer the Italian peninsula in the Fourth and Third Centuries BCE, her most formidable opponents were not the advanced Etruscans, nor the crafty Greeks. Instead, it was the barbarian tribes that nearly overcame Rome: the savage warriors of Cisalpine Gaul and the fierce hill tribe fighters of Samnium.<br/><br/>The nimble mountain warriors of Samnium taught the Romans the advantages of a more flexible formation over the ponderous phalanx. After suffering a sharp reverse at Lautulae, 315, the Romans recovered and dealt a counterstroke at Tifernum, 297 in two battles representative of the many fierce fights between these implacable foes. The political genius of the Samnite general Gellius Aegnatius welded former foes Samnium, Etruria, Umbria and the Gauls into a grand coalition that nearly broke the power of Republican Rome at Sentinum, 295. This battle, more than any other, decided the fate of Italy.<br/><br/>Even as the Samnites and their peninsular allies were subdued, the Gauls arose to carry on the struggle. Calling on reinforcements from across the Alps, the Gauls invaded Italy in 225 and only by a stroke of fortune was this army trapped between two Roman consular armies at Telamon. The battle that followed was one of the most unusual in all of military history, with the Gauls fighting in desperation in two opposite directions, as Roman armies closed in from north and south. Finally, just after Rome had withstood Hannibal&rsquo;s devastating invasion, Hamilcar, a die-hard Carthaginian officer, raised the Gallic tribes for one last great battle at Cremona, 200. In the end, Rome emerged victorious and dominated the Italian peninsula from the straits of Messina to the Alps.<br/><br/>",

Each character has access to basic actions like moving and challenges as well as several unique abilities that may be performed only by spending ability tokens. Funkoverse uses an innovative &quot;cooldown&quot; system&mdash;the more powerful the ability, the longer it will take for the ability token to become available again&mdash;so players have to spend their ability tokens wisely. Each character in Funkoverse is unique, so players are encouraged to try out different combinations of characters and items in order to discover their favorite synergies and powerful strategies for the different game scenarios.<br/><br/>Funkoverse Strategy Game Expansion: Kool-Aid Man #KA100 is an expansion for any standalone title in the Funkoverse line-up that features:<br/><br/>     A unique playable character, Kool-Aid Man! <br/>     New abilities that allow Kool-Aid Man to bust through walls!<br/>     Sparkly Points to add an effervescence to your victory<br/>     The ability to combine this expansion with other Funkoverse titles to create the ultimate team<br/>     Since Kool-Aid Man can bust through walls, altering the map through the use of his Rubble Tokens, the game changes for all characters in play!<br/>     Kool-Aid Man&rsquo;s Splash Zone ability is a powerful area of effect attack that can do a Challenge 3 to all adjacent rivals.<br/>     Kool-Aid Man&rsquo;s Oh Yeah! ability allows him to move through a wall and do a challenge with a single action.

The unrelenting manhunt continues!<br/><br/>Mr. Jack: Extension is an expansion for the Mr. Jack deduction game that features refreshed artwork for the tenth anniversary of the game as well as an original character as strong as it is enigmatic: Professor Moriarty, whose special ability is to imitate one of the characters who is not at stake.

        "description": "The Yuggoth map is quite unusual. It adds three new Areas with special powers.<br/><br/>The Slime Sea<br/>The faction which controls the Slime Sea overlook is allowed to summon the useful Slime Mold monsters, which are a good mid-level monster. The problem is that they obey anyone who controls the overlook. So if you have summoned up a batch of Slime Molds, and then another person captures the overlook from you, they take control!<br/><br/>The Laboratory<br/>The faction which controls the Laboratory is able to use it to transform his Cultists into Brain Cylinders. Fans who have read The Whisperer in Darkness or seen the eponymous film know what I'm talking about. The cylinders still produce Power like a normal Cultist, but cannot move on their own (they have to be carried). They also cannot fight or be selected to take a hit in combat. Instead, when a Brain Cylinder is &quot;dropped&quot;, the other side can capture it. Now they get the Power from it.<br/><br/>The Green Pyramid<br/>The Green Pyramid contains the mighty Brain of Yuggoth, which boosts your faction in many useful ways. However, each Cleanup Phase, the Green Pyramid's controller has to check to see if the Watcher of the Green Pyramid has been awakened! The Watcher is a particularly loathsome Great Old One [later reclassified as a Terror] who is the enemy of every faction, and which, after destroying all units at the Green Pyramid, moves on a set path around the map wreaking destruction everywhere. It has its own unique figure.<br/><br/>",

Szera&rsquo;s history is inexorably tied to her fortress of Arkenspire.<br/><br/>Vague written histories of Vaulsk have been deciphered by scholars to reveal that the earthquake (known by the Pheras as &ldquo;the Welcoming&rdquo;) was both prophesied and coordinated by a large faction of Phera necromancers led by the lich-born girl Szera. Despite the accepted Phera practice of worshipping death, the art of necromancy was new and rather taboo in Pheran society. Szera became a plague on Vaulsk, and was eventually banished along with her retinue. The young girl boldly accepted her exile, and went on to found her own kingdom in what would eventually become Aridika. However, Szera had left her stain on the Pheras, and her will continued even in her absence, to the eventual doom of Vaulsk. The Welcoming completely swallowed the capital city, and only the elder Phera who lived in the safety of the ziggurats survived.<br/><br/>Thus, the greater Pheran empire fell, and its remnants held the lich queen Szera and her burgeoning empire of Aridika directly responsible. The elder Pheras formed a suicide army and crossed the Jaded Depths, determined to tear apart Szera&rsquo;s tower fortress of Arkenspire, stone by stone. Guided by the elder&rsquo;s burgeoning control of the hex magic believed to be released by the Welcoming, the Pheras brought war to Aridika, and gave their collective lives to break apart Arkenspire and its connection to the Arkenhold&mdash;the underworld spiritual prison that Szera sought to rule.<br/><br/>With their dying breath, the Phera elders spoke the mysterious hexes given to them by the Welcoming and bound Szera&rsquo;s supernatural energies to the very soil of Aridika. While the Doomchild lived, her physical existence was injected into the land itself. The Doomchild was cursed to wander her broken kingdom, seeking a way to break the spell that prevented her from merging the worlds of life and death.<br/><br/>Eventually, the First Four Heroes of Eastony defeated Szera and bound her in the depths of her wicked ruined tower&hellip; there the Doomchild sleeps, but still schemes, determined to finish her work.<br/><br/>The Ruins of Arkenspire expansion takes heroes to the accursed tower that was once the Doomchild Szera&rsquo;s seat of power in Aridika. In the heart of Aridika, the entire region of Nethermoor is completely under the control of the Profaned&mdash;a legion of undead abominations that serve their necromantic overlords. As the Profaned begin threatening the provinces surrounding Nethermoor, valiant heroes are needed to push back the undead assault!<br/><br/>Unfortunately, there are worse things lurking around Arkenspire than just the living dead. But the heroes will have to discover those mysteries as they unlock the secrets of the story deck included in Ruins of Arkenspire.<br/><br/>&mdash;description from the publisher<br/><br/>",

        "description": "The expansion adds an extra step to the game: in order to exhibit precious artefacts in their Museums, our Curators will now need to send their agents out into the world to bring them back first!<br/><br/>Players will have to choose which Continents to send their archaeologists to carefully, as funding expeditions doesn&rsquo;t come cheap. However, if you don&rsquo;t have any agents present, you can&rsquo;t bring objects back from that Continent ! Unless of course, you can convince one of your competitor&rsquo;s staff to lend a hand&hellip;<br/><br/>So how does it work ? The expansion&rsquo;s board has spaces for each Continent, on which you can place your agent meeples to symbolize expeditions that you are sending out. Each player starts with one agent that they can place on any Continent they wish for free. Once you have an agent on site, you can bring objects back from that Continent as normal during the Exploration phase. If you have no agent on a particular Continent, but another player does, you can pay them 1 Prestige point to use their staff to do the work for you. If there are no agents present on that Continent, then you can&rsquo;t bring anything back at all !<br/><br/>You can also pay extra to send additional archaeologists to a given Continent. If you do so, you gain additional bonuses, such as extra Prestige points when you draw a card. Each additional agent you send out to the same Continent costs more than the last. However, if you are the first to develop a full network of 3 agents, you gain a considerable bonus ! The second player to do so also gets a (smaller) bonus.<br/><br/>&mdash;description from the publisher<br/><br/>",

I think that only TS enthusiasts have already taken the time to read mission returns on the SpaceCowboys website, a sort of debriefing with your BOB instructor summarizing the mission accomplished in more detail, while preparing you for the next one.<br/><br/>Because TS scenarios do not have an imposed order, you can discover pieces of the main story in a timeline that belongs to you. &quot;Experience&quot; aims to embed and enrich the content of this blue cycle. You can discover more details about the environment where you live or customize your agents.<br/><br/>This last point leaves me pensive ... Can one envisage a system of progression of the heroes in the form of experience, of cosmetics as in the video games, or then in a narrative frame retracing multiple choice paths, like a book of which you are the hero ?<br/><br/>The SpaceCowboys' thinking around this &quot;Experience&quot; box is to allow players to appropriate the adventure of Time Travelers as they see fit.<br/><br/>If you are inspired and attracted to the theme of a particular scenario, you can dive as usual, discover its secrets and mysteries, experience a thrilling adventure and tidy the box. The unique use remains within the reach of those who feel closer to the theme of a scenario than the history of the game.<br/><br/>With &quot;Experience&quot;, it is rather the players eager to deepen their knowledge of the Lore of TS, its characters, history in the stories, which are targeted.<br/><br/>The best part of all this is that the box &quot;Experience&quot; seems to be able to adapt to our progress when we decide to use it, regardless of the order of the scenarios already played or the one from which we go. get it.<br/><br/>&mdash;description from the publisher<br/><br/>",

        "description": "CROIX DE GUERRE brings the French order of battle back into print and adds DINANT: ROMMEL AT THE MEUSE, the brand new Historical ASL campaign on the crossing of the Meuse in May 1940. In addition to the original eight CdG scenarios and the ten new DINANT scenarios, CROIX DE GUERRE includes 22 more out-of-print French scenarios updated for balance and clarity plus a bonus 1944 scenario on the Dinant map. Also included are mapboards 42 and 43 and a revised National Capabilities Chart.<br/><br/>CROIX DE GUERRE not only provides the standard French blue counters for use in 1939-40, but also provides for the first time unique infantry counters for the Vichy French regime&rsquo;s overseas colonies (two-tone French-blue-in-German-blue) and for the Free French (standard French blue with a Cross of Lorraine). That means all the personnel, weapons, and uniquely French vehicle counters used by French forces throughout World War II, as well as the detailed Chapter H historical notes to accompany the counters and revised Chapter A rules to reflect the new French infantry counters.<br/><br/>DINANT: ROMMEL AT THE MEUSE takes players through the rapid movement of Erwin Rommel&rsquo;s Panzer-Division 7 across the Meuse and through the &ldquo;impenetrable&rdquo; Bois d&rsquo;Ardennes and shows the fighting at the southernmost portion of the river crossing at the town of Dinant during 11-14 May, 1940. Facing the Germans were the exhausted men of the 18th Infantry Division, who had marched almost 50 miles in the preceding three days. High Command had stripped from them all their 60mm mortars, almost half of their motorized transport, and many of their 25mm anti-tank guns, giving those to units &ldquo;more likely to face action.&rdquo;<br/><br/>DINANT: ROMMEL AT THE MEUSE features two historical 22˝&times;34˝ map sections with several new terrain types&mdash;Road Tunnels, Railroad Embankment Underpasses, 15th Century Fortresses, Weirs, and Retaining Walls. The 10 scenarios showcase fighting at and around the area of the crossing. Players will navigate through a maze of narrow streets alongside the Meuse River at the bottom of 90&acute; high cliffs and then climb to the plateau above. The Campaign Game will also see the German player building pontoon bridges and assembling ferries for men, tanks, and equipment to cross the river, all while under fire.<br/><br/>CROIX DE GUERRE is therefore much more than a mere reprint of its predecessor and showcases the French army as never before.

It adds a number of new Discovery and Espionage cards, a new Court, more hexagonal tiles to make even larger and more varied maps, 2 new Territory types (the Observatory and Nexus), and a fifth race:  the Inventions.  This now allows for 5-player games.<br/><br/>The civil war between the Purebreeds, Mongrels, Troglodtyes, and Rhinochs has raged for what seems like ages.  Amidst this endless chaos, the races struggle for any advantage that will turn the tides of war.  Recently, some Mongrel scouts happened upon a gaping chasm of magical energy deep beneath the surface of the earth.  Technowizards from across the land swiftly converged upon this newly christened &ldquo;nexus&rdquo; and set about harnessing its power.  Meanwhile, scientists and priests have constructed magnificent observatories to study the heavens, and the mysteries revealed therein have been both startling and profitable.<br/><br/>But by far the most significant turn of events has been the emergence of a new race &ndash; the autonomous, thinking machines known as the Inventions.  Some suspect the first Invention was created by Sir Erasmus Paniscus, the brilliant Troglodyte engineer. They have rapidly multiplied since their origin, due to their miraculous ability to build new Inventions in their astonishing magical workshops.  For reasons unclear, they possess a profound, almost mystical love of the natural world, and have chosen to shape themselves primarily in the forms of insects, spiders, and beetles.

For the first round, the player order is 5,4,3,2,1; in all other rounds the order is 1,2,3,4,5. If you place an Errand Boy in the left gray circle (with a clock illustration), then your marker is placed on 1 and the other markers shifted right to fill the gap you left. Similarly, if you place your Errand Boy on the right circle, your marker is placed on 2 and other markers shifted right to fill any gap you left.<br/><br/>The Last Will: Plan Order Board was first released at Spiel 2011 as a promotional item.<br/><br/>",

        "description": "From the Book's Introduction:<br/><br/>The Lost and the Damned and its companion volume Slaves to Darkness describe the fantastic and otherwordly Realm of Chaos. This book is concerned with the two great Chaos Powers Tzeentch and Nurgle, their Daemons, and their mortal Champions. The other two major Chaos Powers, Khorne and Slaanesh, have already been described in Slaves to Darkness, volume one of Realm of Chaos.<br/><br/>Warhammer Fantasy Battle players can use this book to create their own Champions of Chaos - mortal heroes whose mighty deeds have won them the deserving patronage of the Chaos Powers. As a Champion of Chaos, your hero will earn special rewards from his patron, including super-human abilities, magical gifts, and daemonic followers. In return for his Patron's favour, your Champion must undertake to fight rival Champions and further the divine aims of his Chaos Power in the mortal world.<br/><br/>Warhammer Fantasy Battle players can also use this book to create Daemonic Armies of the Chaos Powers Nurgle and Tzeentch. Daemonic Armies are so tremendously powerful and highly magical that they are only suitable for fighting each other. This they do more or less continuously as their masters pitch them against each other to test their relative strengths. Champions of Chaos who have grown sufficiently powerful may be summoned to the daemonic battlefield to fight on behalf of their patron.<br/><br/>Warhammer 40,000 players can also create their own Champions to fight each other or any of the other forces of the Imperium. Players can also use this book to design armies of Chaos Renegades and Traitor Marines which confront the Imperium for control of the galaxy.<br/><br/>Warhammer Fantasy Roleplay players can use this book either to create an unusual character type in the Chaos Champion, or to generate endless adversaries for more conventional characters. The narrative generators can also be used as the basis for adventures against or on behalf of the Chaos Powers, and also provide many ideas which you can develop into game plots yourself.<br/><br/><br/>User Summary:<br/><br/>The second part of Realm of Chaos detailing the gods of chaos in Games Workshop's various universes. Weighed in at 300 pages.<br/><br/>Originally written for Warhammer Fantasy Roleplay, Games Workshop had lost some of the IP rights to that world and so promptly quit officially supporting it.<br/><br/>Officially listed as only a supplement for Warhammer Fantasy Battles and Warhammer 40,000, the background material was only useful for Warhammer Fantasy Roleplay. Also, there were Warhammer Fantasy Roleplay stats provided for all the creature included herein.<br/><br/>Focused on the gods Nurgle and Tzeentch, The Lost and the Damned included extensive rules on &quot;narrative campaigns&quot;.<br/><br/>However, the one bad thing about this book was the binding was exceedingly brittle, and the pages very easily separated from it with just minimal use of the book. Plus, unlike Slaves to Darkness, it was never reprinted.<br/><br/>",

        "description": "This entry is for the Kickstarter edition of Museum.  Packaged inside are several expansions that are not contained in the retail release:<br/><br/><br/>     The Crystal Skulls expansion, which adds 12 Crystal Skull cards which can be shuffled into the artifacts and when collected can either be played as a regular artifact or can be sold to a special 'Crystal Skull Collector' for many points.<br/>     The Assistants, each giving a different set-up and a unique ability.<br/>     The League of Extraordinary Explorers, double sized cards that can be purchased for 8 prestige points and exposed in the Main Gallery, these cards also have a unique ability.<br/>     The Solo mode.<br/>     Discard Tiles, for placing cards in a player's storage.<br/>     Extra Cards: 5 Expert cards, 3 Favour cards, 4 Headline cards, 12 Patron cards <br/><br/><br/>About the game:<br/>It&rsquo;s the turn of the 20th century, the golden age of museums. As interest in and accessibility of museums grew exponentially, many institutions underwent an intense period of expansion on both an intellectual and physical level, searching to grow their collections for profit and science.<br/><br/>You play as a curator of one such museum and it&rsquo;s your job to build the biggest, most coherent collection that you can in this game of collection and bartering featuring over 300 individual illustrations by Vincent Dutrait and authentic architectural facts. But it&rsquo;s no simple task!<br/><br/>Each player in Museum has a small collection of relics to get them started, after which, they will have to send explorers around the world to uncover others. These relics each have a value which is either the cost to add them to your museum, or how much they contribute towards adding other relics to your museum. &ldquo;Spent&rdquo; Relics are added to your reserve. You can withdraw them from it by exchanging them for an equal amount of items however your opponents also has access to your reserve!<br/><br/>During the game you will be required to assemble different collections. These can be from different categories (war, agriculture, architecture, etc) or periods (Ancient Egypt, Rome, Aztec, etc). Patron cards will give you bonus cards for amassing certain collections. Explorer cards will allow you to hire famous archeologists to confer bonuses to your museum and event cards will provide you with some game changing circumstances that you&rsquo;ll have to work around, based on historical events!<br/><br/>All these different elements make compiling your collection an interesting and sometimes tricky experience! At the end of the game points are scored based on collections and their value and the player with the most points wins!<br/><br/>",

        "description": "1867 is an 18xx game that is an expansion to 1861: Railways of the Russian Empire, set in Canada. It is essentially &quot;1861 on a new map.&quot; The map represents the central part of Canada, consisting of the southern part of the provinces of Ontario and Quebec.<br/><br/>The key new features are:<br/>a) There are no fixed positions for the minor companies, you  choose a start position when you put up a minor for auction.<br/>b) The State Railway doesn't run its trains and save up for another, but rather just takes the next new train each round. This speeds up the game a little in comparison to 1861, and also accelerates the trains somewhat.<br/><br/>In 2017, this expansion was released as a stand-alone game: 1867: Railways of Canada.<br/><br/>",

        "description": "A native of the western savannahs, Zahra's astonishing speed was hailed by her people as nothing short of a gift from the gods.  She could run down game, outrun predators, and leap tall structures with a bound, a flip, and a whirling somersault.  In fact, it was said she could outrun the sun itself!  Which is where all the trouble began.  The very day she decided to try, Lord Fang made his move.  Now, eager to test her speed against the only worthy adversary left to her, she must aid Arcadia, defeat Lord Fang, and then get back to the savannah, where the real race will begin.<br/><br/>Originally an exclusive figure available only through the Kickstarter campaign. Available in stores as of May, 2015.<br/><br/>",

If you awaken Father Dagon first, then no one else has access to her...unless they can kill her and reawaken her for themselves. Each Great Old One has its own special ability, plus its own unique spellbook, which is earned separately from your own.<br/><br/>&bull; Atlach-Nacha has a special ability that allows you to place one web token in the area where it is located, and if you have a complete chain of web tokens across the map, you receive its spellbook and win the game.<br/><br/>&bull; Bokrug doesn't vanish if killed, but instead demands that you place it on an area with no enemy units during the cleanup. The drawback is that one of your opponents removes one of your cultists from the map during cleanup as well. Thankfully, you can pass Bokrug to an opponent, thereby forcing the loss of a cultist onto that player instead of you.<br/><br/>&bull; Father Dagon gives you an action that washes enemy units from the shore into the sea depths, and once you have his spellbook in play, you must sacrifice a cultist each turn in exchange for 6 power.<br/><br/>&bull; Ghatanothoa mummifies enemy cultists, and his spellbook lets you do so even faster.<br/><br/>",

It contains no fewer than 13 expansions, obviously all compatible and combinable with each other (except where specified otherwise in the rules). You immediately rush to find a copy, which you unearth via your favorite shop or Kickstarter. You start reading the rules, again asking yourself how to integrate all these new parameters, which would raise your Clinic experience to a level of realism never seen before.<br/><br/>You stare groggily for a moment, your gaze swimming vertiginously in the face of this rulebook and its administrative twists and turns, produced by the convolutions of the designer&rsquo;s brain.<br/><br/>Is this even still a game, or will it end up as demanding as a hard day at the office?<br/><br/>That&rsquo;s for you to say&hellip;.<br/><br/>",

After the Indian Union's election cycle has hinged upon heated debates over clone rights, the election's final events will carry forward for many generations&hellip;<br/><br/>Featuring some of the most potent and deck-defining cards from the whole Mumbad Cycle, Fear the Masses carries the cycle to its climactic conclusion, but leaves it to you to deal with the fall-out. Sixty new cards (including a complete playset of nineteen different cards), feature plenty to excite fans of both NBN and those Runners who identify themselves as Anarchs. NBN gains a new identity, a new region upgrade, and two potentially game-changing assets. Meanwhile, as they march against Corp HQs, the Anarchs rally the masses toward dissent and high-pressure discard strategies.<br/><br/>Of course, there's plenty for every faction, and Fear the Masses offers neutral cards for the Runner that give you good odds of bypassing Corp ice for free, as well as a neutral agenda for the Corp that's worth two agenda points, but only requires three advancement to score.<br/><br/>",

A base tea token, tea flavours and additives shown on the card are needed ingredients, and placed in an empty tea cup. The player flips over a tip and receives a coin bonus, moving the thermometer round tracker up one notch if all cups are filled.<br/><br/>The game ends when five rounds of cups have been fulfilled. When the final order is completed, other players complete their last turn so that each player has played the same number of turns.<br/>To score, players add up their victory points from fulfilled customer orders, and add their leftover money to this total. In 3-5 player games, additional points are awarded to the player(s) who fulfilled the most orders and most diverse tea recipes. Award ties are friendly with each winner receiving 5 points.<br/><br/>The player with the most victory points (from customer orders, money, and awards) wins the game as best tea merchant! In the case of a tie, the person with the least number of fulfilled customer cards wins. If still tied, the person with the least amount of money wins. If that does not break a tie, the victory is shared.<br/><br/>Unique features to the deluxe include:<br/><br/><br/>    10 deluxe exclusive cards<br/>    5 deluxe superfan-inspired cards<br/>    5 wild tea ingredient tiles<br/>    3 unique customer tips<br/>    3 NEW ability cards<br/><br/><br/>",

As for the 1982 version, the expansion lets you relive the tensest moments from the story, transporting you into the cinematic film!<br/><br/>The core element of the game is based on the emulation properties of the Thing, which will hide its identity under a blanket of fake humanity, but with substantial differences in the way they interact with the game and with your feelings.<br/><br/>Here are the key points of the expansion:<br/><br/>     A new board, new characters, and new materials.<br/>     A new end game condition represented by the escape of the dog that will arrive at Outpost 31. IF this happens, you can play your next game of the 1982 version with a pack leader dog (a dog that behaves differently throughout the game).<br/>     A new element in the game: teeth! The Thule Station crew discovers that the Alien cannot assimilate and duplicate metal parts, so dental fillings become a way to find out if a person is definitely human, but not if they are alien. The test with the wire and the flamethrower disappears and flashlights are added with which it will be possible to carry out a test and look at the teeth of the other characters, checking for the presence or lack of fillings.<br/>     A new location is available for the Thing: The UFO! It represents the last hope of escape for the Thing, as in the movie. The final confrontation with any remaining humans will take place here. Of course, this is only an option, and just like the dog escape mentioned above, it doesn't necessarily happen! Everything will depend on your behavior, as you can win or lose in many ways!<br/><br/><br/>In the 2011 film, as soon as they found out what's going on, people's behavior becomes more selfish, trying by all means to save their own lives. We therefore decided to try to include the possibility of a solitary escape, an element that will bring the level of distrust to the maximum! This also brings new mechanics, such as the ability to voluntarily sabotage vehicles even if you are human.<br/> The expansion will contain: a new board, new characters, new cards and new tokens.<br/><br/>&mdash;description from the publisher<br/><br/>",

When either Level 3 Homeworld is conquered, that ends the game and the player with the most VPs wins!<br/><br/>All of the hero and villain cards in this set feature a new keyword: Protector.

The maps are compatible with both Age of Steam and Steam.<br/><br/>Vermont<br/>Takes place in the rural forests of Vermont, where the rugged terrain and drastic seasonal changes make railroad building very expensive...but also very lucrative. This map features Seasonal Changes: Every other turn (Winter), track is more expensive. On those turns, however, you'll get a bonus income for each delivery you make. It also feature Unused Action Bonus: Any unused actions receive money, which keeps piling up until someone uses that action.<br/><br/>New Hampshire<br/>Right next door to Vermont, this side of the expansion features strict anti-competitive measures that ensure there's no collusion amongst players. This map features Unique Track Builds: Track builds can not be duplicated; once a player has built a section of track between two locations, no one else can build that same connection.

A TIE reaper is not especially agile, leaving it with only a single defense die, but with six hull and two shields, these starships are durable enough to stick around on the battlefield. In fact, TIE reapers bring something quite special to your Imperial X-Wing squadrons. This ship bears the unusual jam action that lets you jam nearby ships and prevent them from using a focus, evade, or target lock&mdash;opening a wealth of tactical opportunities when you&rsquo;re building your squad or flying into battle.<br/><br/>In the Star Wars: X-Wing Miniatures Game &ndash; TIE Reaper Expansion Pack, you'll find the pre-painted TIE reaper miniature, four different ship cards, eleven upgrade cards, a maneuver dial, and all the other tokens that you need to bring the Empire's deadliest troopers into the heat of battle.<br/><br/>&mdash;description from the publisher<br/><br/>",

However, they don't get far before they hear the distant howling of wargs. And where the warg howls, there also the orc prowls.<br/><br/>The new scenario in Race Across Harad pits the heroes against these wargs and their riders, all within the treacherous wilds of Harad. Their towering oliphaunts may give the heroes an advantage, however, even their oliphaunts cannot keep the heroes safe for long from the warg-riders and their barbed arrows. Instead, their only choice is to quicken their pace and race toward the Ford of Harnen. There, the heroes' massive oliphaunts might be able to crash through waters too deep for the wargs to cross&hellip;<br/><br/>Featuring scenario-specific rules that allow the Orcs and wargs to pursue the heroes from their own staging area, Race Across Harad brings this frantic chase to life in dramatic fashion, as you and your friends need to progress through your quest stages more quickly than the Orcs progress through their own.<br/><br/>Simultaneously, the Adventure Pack introduces a new D&uacute;nedain hero in the Lore sphere, as well as three copies each of nine different player cards that enhance a wide range of the game's existing keywords, Traits, and mechanics. You'll find support for everything from Mounts to side quests and from the Doomed keyword to the cycle's new focus on events that offer powerful rewards when you can target specific pairs of Traits.<br/><br/>",

It opened in 1885, and most of the line was built over the route of the southern section of the Herefordshire and Gloucestershire Canal; Newent, designer Tony Boydell's current home, was part of it.<br/><br/>In this advanced scenario for 1-4 players, Snowdonia: The Daffodil Line mixes up the conventions of the game by adding daffodil collection (!), stone breaking, and canal filling. The Daffodil Line is a limited run of approx. 750 copies.<br/><br/>",

While the priests debate whether they should follow the path of Ruruy (growth, fruit bearing) or Simpa (braiding, entwining) to worship the sun god Inti, your advisors tell you to look to the four suyu (region) you&rsquo;ve conquered. Not just for plunder, but to learn from these vassal nations, and use their expertise to bring glory to the Inca. Do you have what it takes to be the leader of the Realm of the Four Parts in this Golden Age?<br/><br/>This expansion contains 4 modules:<br/><br/>     The &ldquo;Way of the Sun&rdquo; module introduces two alternative layouts for the Sun Temple.<br/>     The &ldquo;Vassals of the Inca&rdquo; module introduces a new secondary action that lets you utilize the specialties of the other nations your armies (or other players&rsquo; armies) conquer.<br/>     The &ldquo;Nobles and Newcomers&rdquo; module is the largest of the new modules, and it introduces a number of new features: a new Building type, newcomer workers, and several new Passive Buildings<br/>     The &ldquo;Pachamama&rdquo; module is an improved and streamlined solo opponent for the game, based on (and replacing) Axomamma.<br/>     Additionally, this expansion contains 8 new Passive Buildings, that can be added to the game regardless of playing with any of the modules or not.<br/><br/><br/>&mdash;description from the publisher<br/><br/>",

The Enforcers Expansion Pack is composed of three characters, ALINA IVANKOVA, TOM LEE and &ldquo;RAVEN&rdquo; KWIATKOWSKI, with their three miniatures and their corresponding cards.<br/><br/>The Enforcers in multiplayer game<br/><br/>The Enforcers are three special characters that players can recruit throughout the game, like we usually do with the Jobs cards. The peculiarity is that they are part of a common market and that there are only three, so, as you can imagine, they are characters with outstanding skills, who have a notable impact in each game.<br/><br/>The Enforcers, as we said, will also have their own miniature and move around the board like the thugs. Their power on the board, that is, their strength on the streets of Chicago, lies in the fact that they all have a passive skill that can be activated at specific moments in the game. In addition, and as with vehicles, they cannot be eliminated from the game: they have come to the city to stay.<br/><br/>Each of the Enforcers comes with two additional cards: their Enforcer card, like that of the rest of the Right Hands, where their muscle and influence points are printed, as well as their skill and the effect it has on the crime rate; and a second card, where on one side we find how the mini works on the board in multiplayer games, and on the other,the specific rules of that Enforcer in solo games.<br/><br/>The Enforcers in solo mode<br/><br/>The second important new feature of this Expansion Pack has to do with the solo mode of Scarface 1920. The solo mode is based on a two-player game in which the other player is controlled by an AI (artificial intelligence) that builds a deck of cards with their own deck building system. This artificial intelligence will carry out its activity in Chicago like a player, but it will demonstrate a resource and organizational capacity superior to ours, forcing us to optimize our gang to the maximum to be able to overcome it.<br/>With this Expansion Pack, the rival gang in solo mode will have the invaluable help of an Enforcer, whose miniature will be used to determine where the power of the rival gang is in the map. In this mode, as we have said before, the Enforcers have a card where their skills are explained, which have a different impact on the game: in solo mode, Alina Ivankova, for example, is capable of extorting the rival in the reorganization phase depending on the number of jobs he has.<br/><br/>&mdash;description from the publisher<br/><br/>",

After studying fine art at university he picked up his first freelance work with Games Workshop&rsquo;s publishing house Black Library, which quickly led to a position in the main GW art department where he worked for 7 years, looking for new challenges he returned to freelance work around 5 years ago. He is currently still based in Nottingham and now works in a wide variety of fields and media including book illustration, concept design for the games industry, military history paintings and portraiture, and of course the legendary Magic: the Gathering cards!!<br/><br/>The two survivors include:<br/><br/>Angry Mary<br/><br/>Mary used to lead a peaceful life in retail, with a husband (cop), two kids and a house with a white picket fence. Then the zombies came and took it all.  Returning home to an (almost) empty house one day, she narrowly escaped becoming zombie chow by dispatching the untidy interlopers of her lovely home. Something snapped, and the wild energy of her misspent youth came roaring back. Mary emptied her husband&rsquo;s gun safe and turned into an urban warrior. She does seem to have a special grudge against zombies though and never passes up a chance to kill them.<br/><br/>Red Cap Ben<br/><br/>As a young boy, Ben was strongly influenced by the Cold War and the fashion for survival that abounded from the 60&rsquo;s to the 80&rsquo;s. He went from job to job, knowing the inevitable would happen and preparing for it. He didn&rsquo;t really expect zombies to show up, though, and still suspects it might be a government conspiracy. Nowadays, Ben is best known as &ldquo;the red cap&rdquo;, a hardcore survivalist with numerous successes on what seemed impossible missions. As grumpy as he acts, Ben likes the nickname.<br/><br/>",

Now, at the end of the cycle, as the U.S. government threatens to strip New Angeles of its privileges as a special commerce zone, Quorum gives us sixty new cards (three copies each of twenty different cards) that focus on getting back to business as usual. That means you'll find the Corps investing in their futures, deploying advanced new economic operations, bribing powerful and highly connected politicians, and layering their servers with brand new ice.<br/><br/>It's not just the Corps that are eager to end the violence and get back to business. Still, what you want to do and what you need to aren't always the same thing. In the wake of the Twenty-Three Seconds incident and the ensuing devastation, you'll still find the game's Anarchs looking to burn things down, even as the Criminals double their efforts to work undetected and the game&rsquo;s Shapers show off their newest tricks.<br/><br/>",

The sword of protection has broken again. The king has opened up the forgotten tomb granting you access to Sword Mastery, Sword Relics, and Sword Tips.<br/><br/>In Swordcrafters, players compete to forge the best sword scoring based on length, quality, and magic. Each round, each player makes one cut in a grid of sword tiles to create a separation. After the separations phase, each player selects one grouping of sword tiles and assembles them into their sword. When there are not enough sword tiles to form a new grid, scoring occurs.<br/><br/>Players hold their swords in the center of the table to score based on length. Sword quality is based on the highest number of adjacent matching gems on each side of the sword. Sword magic scoring is based on the relevant gems required by each of three sword magic cards.<br/><br/>The Expanded Edition layers in three exciting new modules: Relics, Tips, and Mastery. Relics add new tiles to the grid creating more importance on your set collection expertise. Tips grant players two additional goals that score based on their sword. Mastery challenges players to complete mini-goals throughout the game.<br/><br/>The enemies are growing stronger and the King has asked you to craft an enhanced sword of protection using:<br/>- Sword Mastery: claim each round to hone your blade<br/>- Sword Relics: Add fragments of the past to the grid to keep your slices and selections intense<br/>- Sword Tips: personal goals test how sharp you truly are<br/>Contents include the full base game plus three modules to mix and match for amazing replay value:<br/><br/>",

Airplanes with both single and twin machineguns are included, featuring also a couple of experimental machines that saw actual action: a twin-MG Halberstadt D.III and a Fokker E.IV with three Mgs that was flown personally by Max Immelmann.<br/><br/>The decks included are two copies of the new P one and a copy of the G. The latter was already included in the Watch Your Back! box.<br/><br/>A Wings of War Booster Pack is not a complete game. The Immelmann Booster Pack requires to play any other Wings of War game set (Famous Aces, Watch Your Back!, Burning Drachens), with the special rules for replacing B damage cards with A ones if you don't have them (halving damages down).<br/><br/>Part of the Wings of War series<br/><br/>",

Are you ready for a new adventure?<br/><br/>Dragons, Treasures &amp; Mysteries includes 3 new modules:<br/><br/>The Treasures module provides new treasure chest tokens that each player receives at the start of the game. Each player will choose one to put somewhere on each of the terrain tiles. After all of the tokens are placed, they are flipped face up. If a player's explorer stops next to a token, they may meet a requirement, usually discarding a certain amount or total value of one color of card. If they fulfill the requirement, they receive the token. The token may be spent to move your explorer up to 2 spaces. However, if you collect 4 treasure chest tokens, you win the game immediately!<br/><br/>The Dragons module contains 4 dragon pawns each in different colors corresponding to the cards' colors. The dragons start the game asleep and each on their own terrain tile. Once a player's explorer steps onto a terrain tile with a sleeping dragon, the dragon awakens and no one may walk through or next to it's space. However, once you play a card whose color matches the dragon, you may move the creature one space, potentially moving it out of your way and blocking your opponents! This module also includes new cards that allow players to perform actions relating to the dragons.<br/><br/>The Mysteries module introduces new, smaller terrain tiles with dark mists. They are placed onto normal terrain tiles to add areas of mysterious fog. Once a player stops next to a mystery tile, it's flipped over and the layout underneath becomes visible. The player who uncovered the tile gains a bonus token and may then rotate and place it to create new terrain spots of jungle, water, etc. which are on the back of each mystery tile.<br/><br/>",

There is no sense in making the first game too complicated, and you can look forward to using them.<br/><br/>The first time you decide to include the bonus cards, we recommend adding them to the Round 3 flight cards. This will give you 18 instead of 16, but you can be certain that they will turn up. This will make Round 3 a bit longer and more intense.<br/><br/>In later games, put them into decks II and III.

But so do their keepers, the ancient race Viratis that walk between the light and the shadow.<br/><br/>In this expansion you will explore megalith ruins on a new island, utilize magical relics, and command new forces that move between Cruelty and Mercy for powerful effects.<br/><br/>Inside the box you can find new player cards for existing factions, a new Region deck for the Hinterlands that include the new Viratis faction, and special map Regions that contain powerful Megaliths instead of towers.<br/><br/>The KS campaign also included a URL to a free mini-solo mode: Faraway Invaders.<br/><br/>-description from publisher<br/><br/>",

The kit adds ten new battles, adding the French army to the mix and expanding your existing forces.  Of course, the two major land battles involving the French Army are included in the scenarios: Savannah and Yorktown. The expansion also takes a detailed look at the Battle of Brandywine, along with the battles of Springfield, Kings Mountain and Pell&rsquo;s Point.  New terrain tiles, additional blocks, stickers and larger, molded dice, are all included so you can play these new American Revolution War engagements.<br/><br/>Here&rsquo;s what&rsquo;s in the box:<br/><br/>3    Terrain and Accessories punchboards containing (these are the thick tiles that have been so well received by players), totaling 45 Double-sided Terrain Tiles and 18 Double-sided Victory Banner counters<br/>8    Battle Dice &ndash; Bigger and now molded dice&hellip;!<br/>3    Block Label sheets<br/>4    Summary Cards<br/>2    Unit Reference Charts<br/>2    Terrain Effects Charts<br/>1    Rule and Scenario Booklet<br/>Over 100 wooden blocks<br/><br/>You must own a copy of Commands &amp; Colors: Tricorne base game to use this Expansion Kit.<br/><br/>By design, Commands &amp; Colors Tricorne - The American Revolution is not overly complex. The game is based on the highly successful Commands &amp; Colors game system, where the Command cards drive movement while creating a &ldquo;fog of war&rdquo; and the battle dice resolve combat quickly and efficiently. Commands &amp; Colors Tricorne - The American Revolution, however, introduces many new game concepts, which will add historical depth and provide even the most veteran Commands &amp; Colors player many new play experiences and challenges.<br/><br/>The scale of the game fluctuates, which allows players to effectively portray some of the larger American Revolution battles, as well as smaller size skirmish actions. In some scenarios, an infantry unit may represent an entire brigade, while in others a unit may only represent a few companies of soldiers. Still the linear tactics of the period, that you will need to execute to gain victory, conform remarkably well to the advantages and limitations inherent to the various American Revolution Armies of the day, and the battlefield terrain features on which they fought. To further emphasize the differences in battlefield doctrine between the British and Continental forces, each army has its own unique deck of Combat cards.<br/><br/>Players, that are familiar with other Commands &amp; Colors games, will soon note that unit combat losses in a Tricorne game are typically not as great as other games covered in the Commands &amp; Colors series. This is a direct result of the linear tactic fighting style of the armies that fought during the American Revolution. Unit morale is the main thematic focus in a Tricorne battle as it was historically. Knowing that an entire unit, that has only taken minimal losses when forced to retreat, may actually break and rout from the battlefield, will definitely keep players on the edge of their command chairs during an entire battle.<br/><br/>",

Its sixty cards (which include a new hero and three copies of each new player card) lead several of Middle-earth's greatest heroes along a detour from their homeward path. Even in the arid wastes of Harad's deserts, even after traveling league upon grueling league, and even after just barely surviving their encounters with Orcs, Wargs, and giant spiders&mdash;the heroes remain true to themselves and committed to their fight against the Dark Lord.<br/><br/>Accordingly, when your heroes come across an opportunity to strike against a caravan of Haradrim carrying tributes to the Dark Lord of Mordor, they hesitate only long enough to devise a plan. When the caravan camps inside the walls of a dilapidated desert fortress, the heroes and their allies will launch their ambush. But will their tactics prove sound enough to account for the caravan's greater numbers? You'll join these heroes and fight alongside them in the new scenario from The Black Serpent.<br/><br/>",

The effects of this research was obvious...<br/><br/>Yes, our scientists have opened a portal to R'lyeh and bad stuff is coming through. Multiuniversum: Project Cthulhu, the first expansion for Multiuniversum, includes twenty new worlds full of Cthulhu that replace the original ones and bring in new mechanisms and risks. So what are we changing here?<br/><br/><br/>    Portals: Every time you close a portal, you lose a bit of your sanity, which is represented by insanity cards.<br/>    Insanity Cards: These cards are something new and nasty. As you close portals, you collect them and they are face down for most of the time.<br/>    Museum Card: The museum is where the players can get some of their sanity back. You can interact with it to spend some of your insanity cards for various effects.<br/>    Move: In addition to all the things you could do using action cards, you can also discard one to move to an adjacent transformer.<br/><br/><br/>",

Sometimes there are fewer monks in the game, sometimes no gears may be placed on place cards or the building of trading stations must be paid for with an additional coin.<br/><br/>New events are now also linked to the &quot;corpse tokens&quot; which players must place a certain number of in their bag at the end of each round. These tokens might be randomly drawn from the bag at the beginning of the round and occupy valuable space on the marketplace because they cannot be used for any action. To get rid of them for good, a player can fulfill indulgence cards through pilgrimage, donations, or other conditions, which also bring victory points at game's end. Fortunately, each player has a &quot;plague doctor&quot;, a new figure that is available in (almost) every round and can be used universally.<br/><br/>&mdash;description from the publisher<br/><br/>",

Their denizens may look like they&rsquo;re nice, but they are all out of mercy when it comes to conflict. Their fighting techniques and magic are much different from what you already know.

Slay the dragon, reforge the ancient sword, or just work as an enforcer to gain crystals or glory.

Each player leads a faction of survivors with dozens of different characters in the game.<br/><br/>Dead of Winter is a meta-cooperative psychological survival game. This means players are working together toward one common victory condition &mdash; but for each individual player to achieve victory, he must also complete his personal secret objective. This secret objective could relate to a psychological tick that's fairly harmless to most others in the colony, a dangerous obsession that could put the main objective at risk, a desire for sabotage of the main mission, or (worst of all) vengeance against the colony! Certain games could end with all players winning, some winning and some losing, or all players losing. Work toward the group's goal, but don't get walked all over by a loudmouth who's looking out only for his own interests!<br/><br/>Dead of Winter is an experience that can be accomplished only through the medium of tabletop games. It's a story-centric game about surviving through a harsh winter in an apocalyptic world. The survivors are all dealing with their own psychological imperatives, but must still find a way to work together to fight off outside threats, resolve crises, find food and supplies, and keep the colony's morale up.<br/><br/>Dead of Winter has players making frequent, difficult, heavily- thematic, wildly-varying decisions that often have them deciding between what is best for the colony and what is best for themselves.<br/><br/>",

In this 3-6 player map, players compete to build and deliver goods to steamboats which are moving up and down the Mississippi River. Instead of urbanizing towns into cities, players use the Steamboat Building action to build steamboats outside of port cities. Delivering to a steamboat provides players with a 1 income bonus, and goods can be transported from and through steamboats as well. Each turn, the steamboats move a certain number of spaces up or down the river.<br/><br/>Age of Steam Expansion: Golden Spike: This Age of Steam expansion takes place in 1860&rsquo;s Western USA, where the Union Pacific Railroad and the Central Pacific Railroad raced towards each other in order to complete the first transcontinental railroad system with the Golden Spike. This is a 4-player team-dependent map, with players delivering goods to cities along the main route to build more track towards Promontory; if one side reaches before the other, their opponents are eliminated. The map starts with pre-printed &quot;hidden&quot; track tiles which are revealed each time a good is delivered to a city along the main Sacramento/Promontory/Omaha line. The game ends on the turn that at least one team reaches Promontory; if both teams reach it, victory points are tabulated as usual. If only one team reaches it, the other team's score is reduced to zero (but the winning team still determines each of their score using the traditional manner).<br/><br/>This expansion is professionally designed, printed and mounted on double-sided gameboard, just like the original Age of Steam map.<br/><br/>",

These scruffy and reluctant Heroes are not much to look at, but when the chips are down, they know how to get the job done. Drifters are rare and have a supernatural element to them, with a penchant for long life and always being in the wrong place at the wrong time. Followed by darkness and death, Drifters fear making any long-term attachments, as they have seen enough to know that nothing lasts forever...well, almost nothing.<br/><br/>The Drifter is a new Hero Class that can be added to your games of Shadows of Brimstone. He is a veteran gunfighter, with long years of experience in fighting evil wherever he goes. As a Danger Magnet though, a Drifter rarely needs to look for trouble... the darkness always finds him.  Includes Male and Female Drifter miniatures in high-detail resin, two 30mm plastic bases, Drifter Double-Sided Hero Character Sheet, Rulesheet, Drifter Upgrade Chart, Starting Upgrade Cards, and Starting Gear.<br/><br/>",

This map includes Special Collections, where the first player to build a Gate can seize amazing new powers in the form of extra spellbooks. But beware! If you lose control of your Special Collection, your new spellbook becomes overdue, and the terrifying Librarian menaces you.<br/><br/>The Custodian cleans up chambers by moving units in the Area to another Area termed the Oubliette. Over the course of the game, this Oubliette tends to get filled with units. Sometimes fights break out.<br/><br/>The Librarian can only be activated if a player has an overdue Book, in which case it can wreak some real damage. Fortunately, you can mitigate the damage by returning the Book, though not necessarily eliminate all threat.<br/><br/>The Library at Celaeno introduces a new mechanism in Cthulhu Wars: Silence tokens. These are used to trigger certain special actions including moving the Custodian, Librarian, and triggering some of the special Library books on this map.<br/><br/>",

There are the jungles and the beasts that lair within them. There are the Orcs and Wargs sent by the Dark Lord of Mordor to patrol the region. And there are the deadly expanses of desert, where the sun and dehydration can kill you slowly, provided you're not first captured and eaten by the hidden predators that lie in wait.<br/><br/>In Beneath the Sands, several of Middle-earth's greatest heroes continue their perilous journey through the hostile lands of Harad, only to find evidence of giant spiders that have dragged people under the dunes. Compelled to investigate, your heroes must crawl into the spider's tunnels, only to navigate a scenario that weaves through a labyrinth of cobweb-choked darkness, blocked passages, and deadly spiders. Time is of the essence, as the spiders' victims may yet be alive, but you'll need to be clever and attentive lest you become lost underground.<br/><br/>With scenario-specific rules that allow you to squander your progress when you get off-track, even if you quest successfully, Beneath the Sands places an emphasis upon the game's questing and exploration in a way that truly allows you to feel trapped in a maze. Fortunately, the Adventure Pack also comes with a new Scout hero and twenty-seven player cards (three copies each of nine different cards) to help you get back onto the proper path&mdash;or forge your own.<br/><br/>",

They have crossed deserts, tamed M&ucirc;makil, fled from Orcs on Wargs, and tunneled through a den of giant spiders. They have ambushed a caravan loaded with tithes meant for the Dark Lord of Mordor. And they have made allies along their way.<br/><br/>For much of their homeward journey, the heroes have been accompanied and assisted by the small band of Haradrim led by Kahliel (The M&ucirc;makil, 1) and his lieutenants. Together, they have survived the perils of Harad's jungles and deserts. They have fought together and bled together, so when Kahliel learns that his tribesmen are being held prisoner in the &quot;Iron Pass&quot; of Cirith Gurat, the heroes don't hesitate to volunteer their swords. Their friends will be freed.<br/><br/>While the scenario from The Dungeons of Cirith Gurat leads your heroes deep into one of the Dark Lord's prisons, its player cards arm you for the battles to come. Once you spring Kahliel's tribesmen from prison, you'll need to fight your way free of Orc jailors and pursuers, and you'll be happy for the assistance of the Adventure Pack's new Weapons, Warriors, and events.<br/><br/>",

A new team of Agency commandos, call sign Tin Man, has tracked the rogue alien to a secret research facility in Russia. Their mission: exterminate. Meanwhile, Cronos has revived Russian experiments incorporating Ghin technology. In his new Russian collaborators he has found the means to protect his nefarious research.<br/><br/>To reach Cronos, the commandos will first have to go through his army of Spetznaz and confront a new genetically engineered nightmare. But Tin Man has a hulking mech suit bristling with weapons and high-tech capabilities, as well as an unlikely ally in Thoth, a Ghin scientist with powerful psychotronic abilities and the sworn enemy of Dr. Cronos.<br/><br/>Extreme Prejudice is an adrenaline-fueled expansion for LEVEL 7 [OMEGA PROTOCOL], a semi-cooperative board game of miniatures-based tactical combat for 2&ndash;6 players. Includes five new scenarios, three new enemy types, and two new commandos.<br/><br/>",

Unfortunately, only one particular plot of fertile soil in the area is the best for growing magical plants. Everyone agrees to &quot;share&quot; the garden, but you have a plan: Your team of loyal sprites will use the powers of the plants to infiltrate the garden as it grows, so that when everything is in full bloom, the most potent patches will belong to you!<br/><br/>In Power Plants, you are a wizard growing a shared garden of magical plants with your rivals. Each turn, you choose one of the patch tiles from your hand and add it to the growing garden. You can activate the added tile for its dynamic &quot;plant&quot; power or activate all the tiles it touches for their slightly weaker (but still very cool) &quot;grow&quot; powers. As the fields expand, you strategically deploy your sprites to gain control of more and more of the fantastic flora. Will your magical horticulture skills pay off?<br/><br/>Manipulate the garden's growth, gather magical gems, and deploy your team of loyal sprites to repel your competition and be in control of the most valuable fields when the garden is complete!<br/><br/>&mdash;description from the publisher<br/><br/>",

This expansion introduces the vermin family:  seven new monsters from hordes of Rats to the horrendous Remorhaz who crawl from the sewers to challenge the heroes.  Do not be deceived by the diminutive size of these monsters, with their ability to instill fear and inflict poison attacks on even the most battle hardened warriors.  Left untreated, poisoned heroes can meet a swift end.  Fortunately, the heroes can retaliate with the lethal Vermin Blade.  Furthermore, the Wizard gets new spells to cure poison and the ability to cast the powerful Giant Fireball.<br/><br/>Also included are new rules and enhanced cards for owners of the Cavern of Soloth expansion.<br/><br/>Released March, 2012<br/><br/>",

Among them the scholars found a map showing the way to the First City &ndash; a forgotten metropolis reputed to had been built atop the Tomb of Muratan the Dragonlord himself, and now a new target for the Noble Houses locked in a power struggle. Whose Wizard will show the most skill navigating the Forgotten Metropolis? Who will uncover Muratan&rsquo;s Legacy? Who will be the first to answer the Call of the Dragonlord?<br/><br/>Call of the Dragonlord is a premium modular expansion for Simurgh, a dynamic tile-laying, worker-placement game that debuted during Essen Spiel 2015. Introducing a second board depicting the Forgotten Metropolis, Call of the Dragonlord also adds a new type of Vassal &ndash; the Wizard &ndash; as well as a set of new Action Tiles.<br/><br/>As an addition to each player&rsquo;s workforce, the Wizard can be used separately, or in conjunction with the new board. With the Forgotten Metropolis in play, players will move their Wizards on three different tracks, each providing Power Points and resources. But this movement comes with a cost, and only managing their Spellbook smartly will allow a player to reap the benefits of their Wizard being first to enter the Dragonlord&rsquo;s Tomb.<br/><br/>Apart from expanding the pool of Resource, Transformation, Exploration, Research and Objective Tiles, Simurgh: Call of the Dragonlord also introduces Leadership Tiles &ndash; a new type of Action Tiles that may be used with the new board, or simply added to the base game without using any other expansion elements. With Action Spaces allowing for movement of multiple Vassals in one turn, Leadership Tiles add unexpected mobility to players able to make smart use of the unique abilities these tiles provide.<br/><br/>",

Their restaurant grew, more demanding guests came and they were able to hire more staff. Unfortunately, the success didn't last long and the restaurant became quiet. The number of guests decreased, temporary workers had to be let go and not all damage in the restaurant could be repaired. So the players decided that the restaurant needed a change. It is high time to add a pastry shop to the restaurant and serve sweet desserts: tiramisu, cr&egrave;me br&ucirc;l&eacute;e and fancy sundaes &ndash; because it's Time for Dessert!?<br/><br/>The expansion Time for Dessert! introduces a new type of order. By taking advantage of additional actions and using ingredients such as fruit, cream and ice cream, the players have to satisfy the demanding wishes of the guests. A specialist helps to carry out actions twice in one go, but also needs more time to do so. If the players use their earned money for investments, these bring advantages in every shift. As in the basic game, all new rules are conveyed over the course of several scenarios.<br/><br/>While the story begins after the end of the last Kitchen Rush scenario, players only need to know the rules of the first four scenarios in order to play the expansion. Each of the seven new scenarios introduces new elements. Each group can decide for themselves whether they play the entire campaign or simply repeat the scenario that they enjoy the most.<br/><br/>-description from publisher<br/><br/>",

There were, however, two major factors that made their tactical efforts somewhat less successful. None of them was anywhere near Alexander the Great in their ability either to understand or to utilize tactical systems. And, they loved elephants (to be honest, so did Alexander, but he never had the chance to use them). Thus, while this period is the heyday of the Macedonian art of war (if not exactly its apogee), we find the system becoming overly rigid and ill-served.&quot;<br/><br/>Two battles:<br/><br/>    Raphia - 217 BC<br/>    Magnesia - 190 BC (also included in SPQR (Deluxe Edition))<br/><br/><br/>Expansion module for the Great Battles of History (GBoH) series game SPQR.<br/><br/>",

        "description": "The Dreamlands expansion contains two separate maps (smaller than 40x20, but larger than half-size - together the two maps cover more area than a 40x20 map). One map is the Surface World, while the other is the Underworld. Certain Areas on the map are Portals between the two maps, and when you are at one of these sites, you can travel back and forth. For instance, the Tower of Koth (Underworld) and Sarkomand (Surface) are one linked pair.<br/><br/>&quot;Why would I want to travel around?&quot; you ask. It's simple - both maps have certain Areas that contain what we are currently calling Citadels (for example: Kadath, or the Vaults of Zin). If you control all of the Citadels on a map, then you win immediately! This gives players a whole new way to win the game! You can be far behind on the Doom track, but pull off a victory by your effectiveness in the Dreamlands.<br/><br/>It's not as easy as it sounds either. The game comes with 6 plastic Zoogs, and a Bhole. Both of these species are controlled by game rules - not the players. The Zoogs scuttle across the Surface World, interfering with your cultists and your Gates, as a pesky annoyance. The Bhole, on the other hand, is a fearsome predator who periodically rises from the depths of the Underworld and can demolish entire armies. Both of these make it more challenging to get a &quot;Citadel victory&quot; which of course improves gameplay further, because typically some players are going for the old-fashioned Doom victory, while others are going for Citadels and the interaction becomes even more thrilling.<br/><br/>",

The aim of the game is to amass victory points by shipping goods to Europe or by constructing buildings.<br/><br/>Each player uses a separate small board with spaces for city buildings, plantations, and resources. Shared between the players are three ships, a trading house, and a supply of resources and doubloons.<br/><br/>The resource cycle of the game is that players grow crops which they exchange for points or doubloons. Doubloons can then be used to buy buildings, which allow players to produce more crops or give them other abilities. Buildings and plantations do not work unless they are manned by colonists.<br/><br/>During each round, players take turns selecting a role card from those on the table (such as &quot;Trader&quot; or &quot;Builder&quot;). When a role is chosen, every player gets to take the action appropriate to that role. The player that selected the role also receives a small privilege for doing so - for example, choosing the &quot;Builder&quot; role allows all players to construct a building, but the player who chose the role may do so at a discount on that turn. Unused roles gain a doubloon bonus at the end of each turn, so the next player who chooses that role gets to keep any doubloon bonus associated with it. This encourages players to make use of all the roles throughout a typical course of a game.<br/><br/>Puerto Rico uses a variable phase order mechanic, where a &quot;governor&quot; token is passed clockwise to the next player at the conclusion of a turn. The player with the token begins the round by choosing a role and taking the first action.<br/><br/>Players earn victory points for owning buildings, for shipping goods, and for manned &quot;large buildings.&quot; Each player's accumulated shipping chips are kept face down and come in denominations of one or five. This prevents other players from being able to determine the exact score of another player. Goods and doubloons are placed in clear view of other players and the totals of each can always be requested by a player. As the game enters its later stages, the unknown quantity of shipping tokens and its denominations require players to consider their options before choosing a role that can end the game.<br/><br/>The new buildings are: Aqueduct, Forest House, Black Market, Storehouse, Guesthouse, Church, Trading Post, Small Wharf, Lighthouse, Library, Speciality Factory, Union Hall, Cloister, and Statue.<br/><br/>",

Masters of super science and the macabre, they work in the shadows, only emerging when required to accomplish their fiendish goals! Known for the ruthless and gruesome experiments they perform, the Flesh Stalkers splice the DNA and body parts of various creatures and people together, creating hideous monstrosities to do their bidding. Of all their wretched constructs, the most numerous are the Flesh Drones; mindless automatons cobbled together from the hapless souls stolen in the night by the Stalker, mixed with metal and madness to form the perfect hive of worker drones. When not in use, they are stored, dormant, on rows of hooks, hanging from the ceiling by the crude handles attached to their backs...waiting to be activated for the next call to harvest new bio-material and bodies.<br/><br/>This Deluxe Enemy Pack contains everything you need to add the sinister Flesh Stalker and his gruesome Flesh Drone minions to your games of Shadows of Brimstone! Included are 6 Flesh Drone models and 1 Flesh Stalker large model, the 2 large Enemy Record Sheets for them, a host of new cards themed around the Flesh Stalker - including all of the Threat Cards needed to add them to your games, and 2 new Missions focusing on these deadly new Enemies!<br/><br/>",

These are NOT just aesthetic changes! These change the gameplay drastically. Each map takes a different approach to where control areas are placed, how much space is between the control areas and what terrain surrounds them. This requires a different strategy on how to approach and defend the control areas resulting in a very different experience!<br/><br/>Maps Expansion Includes:<br/><br/>1 Winter Highlands Map Scroll<br/>6 Winter Highlands Box Covers (to be placed over the Evergreen Woodlands boxes) <br/>1 Savage Wasteland Map Scroll<br/>6 Savage Wasteland Box Covers (to be placed over the Evergreen Woodlands boxes) <br/>1 Reinforced Envelope<br/><br/>The box covers are constructed of thick premium cardstock and can be flattened after use for easy storage.<br/><br/>-description from Kickstarter page<br/><br/>",

There is no government. No army. No civilization. The United States has collapsed &mdash; and now, thirty years after the war started, new powers finally try to take control of the ruined country, try to establish a new order, try to control others and create a new country, a new state: the 51st state.<br/><br/>In this card game, players control one of the four powers &mdash; Mutants, Traders, New Yorkers and Appalachians &mdash; and try to build their own new country. Players put new locations into the game, hire leaders, and send people to work in buildings to gain resources and new skills.<br/><br/>Every card in 51st State can be put into play three ways: you can invade a location to gain many resources once, or you can sign a contract with this location to gain one resource every turn, or you can attach the location to your State so you can use its skill. One card, three possibilities. Lots of decisions and choices that matter.<br/><br/>The Gamefound edition also comes with all of the mini-expansions and promos released prior to 2022, component upgrades, and a fictional story set in the Neuroshima world. In more detail, with this edition, you have eight factions available for play instead of four, a dedicated neoprene playmat for the No Man's Land expansion, engraved wooden markers, and many promos that expand the game even more.<br/><br/>",

Mercenaries are optional Units (not Monsters) that may each be included separately at the beginning of any game.<br/><br/>To include a Mercenary, simply place the miniature of standee and corresponding Mercenary card in a central area that all players can see and reach at the start of the game.<br/><br/>As a Free Action on your turn, using either Gold or an Orb, you may hire a Mercenary. The hired Mercenary is placed directly into your Ready Area and is available for use. If you paid Gold to hire the Mercenary, it will be yours until the end of your next Regroup action. If you hired the Mercenary using an Orb, it is yours for the rest of the game.<br/><br/>The Shapeshifter is an optional play expansion mercenary for Dwellings of Eldervale that now starting with the 2nd printing (initial Second Edition printing) comes in its own tuckbox. This expansion is now only available as a separate expansion pack. Included in the tuck box is the 50mm Shapeshifter miniature, standee, and corresponding game card. For the right price you can hire the Shapeshifter, a very versatile ally.  The Mimic ability allows you to use one of your other Unit's abilities, except Build.<br/><br/>ALL First/Kickstarter Edition copies of Dwellings of Eldervale came with a surprise/hidden Shapeshifter placed under the bottom tray of the game box. Because this was a closely held secret until the first of the campaign rewards were opened by Kickstarter campaign backers, the Shapeshifter is not pictured in the first printing of the rulebook, but the Shapeshifter card did come in the standard card pack shipped with all copies to &quot;spark the hunt&quot;.<br/><br/>&mdash;description from publisher<br/><br/>",

Play is also affected by the Night &amp; Day phases of the moon. Players must build from the central hex (which counts as a city but has no color or goods) or cities linked to it.  The Engineer action now enables players to build three pieces of track. Another new action, Low Gravitation, allows the use of one link belonging to another player during goods and movement phases. <br/> The Berlin Wall expansion (first released in 2008) features a new Engineer action allowing a player to build three pieces of track or remove one red track marker from the board. Goods may be delivered from east to west (and vice versa) only through holes in the wall by removing the red track markers. Red cubes represent the Soviet Army and Blue cubes the American, British and French forces; movement of these cubes is restricted until the round marker reaches the red player marker that was placed at the start of the game. At this point all restrictions are removed!<br/><br/>Age of Steam: Moon and Berlin Wall comes packaged inside a box that can hold many AoS expansion maps.<br/><br/>Re-implements:<br/>&bull; Age of Steam Expansion: The Moon<br/>&bull; Age of Steam Expansion: Washington DC and The Berlin Wall<br/><br/>",

Write a new legend of the rightful ruler who brought unity to the rival kingdoms.<br/><br/>In more detail, Paper Tales is a simultaneous drafting card game. Each turn, players draft five units that they then recruit into their kingdom &mdash; assuming that they can pay. These choices determine the players ability to shine in battle, generate great income, construct dominant buildings, and earn legend points. There are only four hiring positions available during the four rounds of the play, but your units grow older with each turn until time takes them away.<br/><br/>Build a comprehensive strategy and adapt the shape of your realm according to opportunities and restrictions and you will make history!<br/><br/>",

Rubble is now &quot;fallen trees&quot; and won't score you any contract card bonuses until it's been &quot;converted&quot; by your mill!<br/><br/>This expansion is comprised of rules and a single deck of 33 cards containing:<br/><br/><br/>    Alternative versions of contract cards for the Necropolis Line scenario<br/>    New trains just for the Bockerlbahn scenario<br/>    New trains for general use...including an Elephant and a caterpillar-tracked Traction Engine (!)<br/>    New station cards!<br/><br/><br/>",

Attendees had to go on a scavenger hunt to collect clues which would permit them to obtain the expansion from the Carcassonne-on-Tour booth.<br/><br/>Short rules:<br/><br/>    Orange full rose is new start tile and defines the four quarters: SW, SE, NW, NE. <br/>    Blue full rose  (reg. backside) redefines the four quarters.<br/>    Orange quarter rose tiles  (reg. backside) are worth 3 bonus points if put down in the corresponding quarter of the playing field, e.g. the South-West rose tile put down in the SW quarter defined by the current valid full wind rose.<br/>    Appart from that the roses have no influence on the play and the features on the tiles and other points aquired through the tile.<br/>    The blue full and the 4 orange quarter rose tiles are shuffled in the stack at the beginning.<br/><br/><br/>Part of the Carcassonne series.<br/><br/>",

        "description": "This expansion includes two survivors and their Zombivor counterparts both designed by Kevin Walker.<br/><br/>Kevin Walker went freelance in 1987 and spent years illustrating for British comic 2000 AD and Games Workshop. There followed years of comics, both writing and illustrating, with a wide variety of media, before becoming a father and realizing it was time to get some work done. Illustrations for the Magic: The Gathering trading card game, several computer game projects and comic work followed, working for 2000AD, DC Comics, Dark Horse and Marvel. Working on Thunderbolts actually attracted some attention. He's now the regular penciller and inker on Avengers Arena for Marvel Comics.<br/><br/>In recent years he has worked on cover art for titles such as Young Bond, Artemis Fowl, Changeling and Vampirates. He is currently working mostly for Marvel Comics from his home in Yorkshire, England.<br/><br/>The two survivors include:<br/><br/>Uncle Honk<br/><br/>Little is known about Uncle Honk, as he likes to call himself. Most people think that he used to work in a circus. Some mutter that, more likely, he was a patient in a psychiatric hospital. What everyone knows for sure, however, is Uncle Honk is a brute with a taste for the circus world and zombicide. If he likes you, you can rely on him and all his formidable might. He&rsquo;ll expect the same in return, of course. Uncle Honk likes to taunt zombies every once in a while, to get in a &ldquo;funny&rdquo; during a fight. With his blood-chilling laugh, Uncle Honk is both your best friend and your worst nightmare.<br/><br/>Butch<br/><br/>After graduation, Butch held down a deadend job for a while before embracing the biker life. For him, it wasn&rsquo;t really about the one percenter life, but more about getting some freedom of choice, a little room to breath in a constricted world. Better to die young with stories to tell than as a senile fool in a gloomy hospital, right? Living on the edge taught Butch a useful trick or two that let him survive when the zombies invaded. Absolute freedom is now at hand, and despite all the slaughter, life is good....<br/><br/>",

The victory that recently seemed hopeless has become conceivable.<br/><br/>I wonder how much truth there is in these fables.  Could anyone really fabricate wondrous items like we hear about in legends?  Command wild animals to do their bidding?  Craft servants out of light and shadow?  I've never seen such things, but I've heard of them, in tales of old...<br/><br/>In Tales of Old, the fourth expansion to Jeremy Lennert's Darkest Night, sends your heroes racing across the kingdom to unravel the mysteries of the holy relics' resting places.<br/><br/>Instead of searching for keys, you now draw Mystery cards that reveal how to obtain clues to the relic's location, and perhaps some other rewards. These mysteries may lead you to explore the depths of ancient catacombs teeming with traps, or encounter an antique trader willing to part with old scrolls for the right price.<br/><br/>Gather your knowledge, courage, and strength as you uncover the kingdom's secrets in the hopes of vanquishing darkness once and for all...<br/><br/>",

You have invested in many of Paris&rsquo; most prestigious building and landmarks, and have made quite the name for yourself. But that does not mean you can rest on your laurels: shrewd foreign investors have set their eye on the French capital, eager to become important players as well in the Parisian real estate market. The most coveted properties are all centered around the most most famous roundabout in the world: La Place de l&rsquo;&Eacute;toile, that features the iconic Arc de Triomphe, which looks down on the Champs-&Eacute;lys&eacute;es. They are up for quite the challenge, since your experience will give you unique advantages over your opponents.<br/><br/>Paris : l'Étoile introduces a new collection of bonus tiles, which will add more variety and replayability to your game of Paris, as well as strategy tiles.

Within this expansion, you&rsquo;ll find twenty-six new objective sets (two copies each of twelve unique objective sets and one copy each of two &ldquo;limit one per objective deck&rdquo; sets). Two brand-new fate cards add new tension to your edge battles, while powerful characters and vehicles like Lando Calrissian and TIE Phantoms join the battle for the fate of the galaxy.

These components are due to be reprinted in the new Rising Sun PTO module.<br/><br/>The first phase of American move into the Solomon islands and Guadalcanal in 1942 called for an attack on Tulagi, an island with a good anchorage and the site of a Japanese seaplane base. Gavutu, Tanambogo and Gaomi are tiny islands off the coast of Tulagi. Between Gavutu and Tanambogo was 300 yard causeway constructed out of concrete and coral. These islands were to be taken in a small part of the main operation against Tulagi. Faulty intelligence had estimated that there were only a &quot;few dozen&quot; construction troops and snipers on these islands. The reality was more like 350 troops including SNLF dug into fortifications and caves. The defenders held out for 31 hours of bitter fighting against an amphibious invasion by the US Marines including suicide charges across a cricket field.<br/><br/>Scenarios:<br/>A61 Across the Wire<br/>A62 Paole Zion<br/>A63 Action at Balberkamp<br/>A64 Chateau de Quesnoy<br/>A65 The Dinant Bridgehead<br/>A66 Counterstroke at Stonne<br/>A67 Monte Castello<br/>DA12 Tussle at Thomashof<br/>HA3 Grabbing Gavutu<br/>HA4 Tanambogo Nightmare<br/>HA5 Take Two<br/><br/>",

After taking either action on a turn &mdash; whether drawing a card or playing a card &mdash; the player can move one of the fish to an orthogonally adjacent space on their game board. (If the fish isn't on the board yet, it enters a space on the outside rings of the player's board.) The two fish cannot be on top of one another.<br/><br/>When a player places coral pieces on their board, they can't cover a fish with coral. When scoring for a formation, they score 1 additional point for each fish on a formation, which means a player can score at most 2 extra points since each formation can be scored only once.<br/><br/>",

It comes with two expansions, the Emigration and Arsenic Expansion, that are not found in the retail edition. They can be obtained in Tinners' Trail: Expansions Box.<br/><br/><br/>In Tinners' Trail, set in 19th century Cornwall, you represent a mining conglomerate at the height of the tin and copper mining industry. You must buy plots of land across Cornwall in auctions and survey them for tin and copper, always managing your &quot;work points&quot; and money effectively.<br/><br/>Once you have a mine in place, it's time to extract the ore and (ideally) make a profit, but the deeper your mine goes, the more expensive the process gets. To reduce the cost of mining, you can place developments, such as ports, train stations, and adits (drainage tunnels), but there's only so many improvements to go around. Once you have made your money &mdash; trying to time the market to sell when prices are high &mdash; you can invest it in industries outside of Cornwall, which gains you victory points. The earlier you invest, the better the return. Can you outplay the competition and make the most money, or will you be left without two shillings to rub together?<br/><br/>What's changed since 2008?<br/>Increased player count - a game that was once only 3-4 players can now be enjoyed by 1-5 players!<br/><br/>2 new expansions - the Arsenic expansion, which introduces a new resource, and the Emigration expansion, which sees miners travel overseas.<br/><br/>Reduced randomness - but still keeping the variability. The board is now set up with tiles instead of the roll of a the dice.<br/><br/>Improved Auctions - dual-use cards are now an important part of the game, giving you information before an auction or an extra boost after an auction.<br/><br/>Improved artwork and graphic design<br/><br/>Improved component quality - with custom meeples and colour blind friendly colours.<br/><br/>Lord Wallace solo mode - a brand new solo mode.<br/><br/>",

In the wake of the retirement of Fastodon, the World&rsquo;s Fastest Mammoth, all manner of foul evil has emerged to wreak havoc. From sinister deities once relegated to myth to arcane menaces who have hovered at the fringes of our mundane world, all have been waiting for just such an opportunity and now return with visions of conquest. After all, one less Champion means one less obstacle in the way of their nefarious machinations. But hope is not lost! As we have learned in recent news, ambitious heroes eager to prove their mettle are patrolling the rooftops and alleys. Among them are practitioners of the mystic arts and noble gods from great pantheons, each able to face the rising tide of villainy for the sake of all that is good and right. A day of decisive battle is descending upon Zeta City, and from it shall emerge...<br/><br/>The Stuff of Legend!<br/><br/>Heroes Wanted: The Stuff of Legend expands the Heroes Wanted universe as Supernatural and Mythic heroes join the fray, while mechanisms such as feats and curses introduce all-new tactics and the price for using them.

        "description": "Lock 'n Load Tactical: Solo is the next evolution in our LnLT series. LnLTS is a solitaire system that provides players with a way to play scenarios and generate battles on their own. We wanted to take that a step farther and provide to have one solitaire system that would work for the entire Lock 'n Load Tactical series past, present, and future games. Gamers will be able to use LnLTS to play any complete Lock &lsquo;n Load Tactical game including any expansions, in either World War 2 or Modern eras. We also wanted players to be able to play the scenarios that come with the games, so LnLTS makes this possible. There will be a few scenarios that won't play as smoothly as most of the scenarios due to events or special rules. LnLTS will work with any scenario generated by our LnLT Battle Generators. Included with LnLTS is a system is a random events generator that is optional to add a little something special to your games and could be used even in two-player games.<br/>         <br/>Lock 'n Load Tactical: Solo was developed bySean Druelinger and David Heath and is based and licensed from Academy Games's Solo game design. We like to thank Uwe Eickert for allowing us to create this edition for the Lock 'n Load Tactical series.<br/><br/>UPDATE: All of our manuals and guides can be Downloaded, Viewed, and even printed right from our LnLP Online Library: We now have an Online Library of all, well almost all of our manuals.  We add some every few weeks.  You can find all the LnLT manuals at the link below.<br/><br/>LnLP Online Library: <a target='_blank' href=\"http://library.lnlpublishing.com/\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer noopener\">http://library.lnlpublishing.com/</a><br/><br/>",

The Nether Realm &mdash; designed by Jon New, the man behind the Talisman-dedicated fansite Talisman Island - offers three new alternative endings for Talisman, along with new Nether cards. Fate also plays a part in this expansion, helping against some of the larger foes found in the Nether deck, but it could also prove to be your downfall.<br/><br/>Talisman: The Deep Realms allows you to travel between the Dungeon and the City regions by venturing into the dark, dank, and haunted passages that connect them. You can cross through the two corpse-filled and rat-infested Deep Realms by means of a perilous bridge or venture even deeper into an ancient system of tunnels inhabited by rats, feral pets, and much worse monsters. In the gloomy and perilous Deep Realms you will certainly encounter tremendous danger, but you may also find tantalizing wealth &mdash; or even a Talisman.<br/><br/>",

These heroes have survived a shipwreck and a desert crossing. They have tamed M&ucirc;makil and allied themselves to a tribe of good-willed Haradrim. They have battled Orcs and Wargs. They have confronted Giant Spiders and wicked Southrons. And they have freed their friends from one of the Dark Lord's dungeons.<br/><br/>But now the friends they have freed are slowing them down. The heroes know the Orcs and Wargs will soon return&mdash;and in greater numbers. The Southrons will want their revenge. And there are still many miles to cross before they reach the safety of Gondor.<br/><br/>With its sixty cards (including a new hero and three copies of each new player card), The Crossings of Poros challenges you and your heroes to find your way through the final stretches of Harad. Will you lead your company through the desert? Or will you ask them to weave their way through the rocky hills of the Ephel D&uacute;ath? Both paths bring their own dangers, and it falls to you to safeguard your heroes, their allies, and their hope for freedom.<br/><br/>",

        "description": "In addition to its 6 Battle Maps, including old favorites like Juno Beach and Utah Beach, this box contains 4 &ldquo;mini-expansions&rdquo; that are completely independent from each other. Players can add 1, or 2, or all of them to their game:<br/><br/>Way to Hell: This expansion introduces the Sea Battle Map to the game. Now, instead of starting your game on the beach, you actually play the terrible boat ride to get there! Players take the role of coxswains (the landing craft commanders) who must dodge German artillery, sea mines and beach obstacles to safely deliver their passengers on the beach. Once they have accomplished their mission, the game continues normally on land, with the players taking the role of the Units.<br/><br/>When playing Way to Hell, players don&rsquo;t roll every turn to see what they gain (like the regular D-Day Dice game), they roll every turn to see what they LOSE. All the Landing Craft start with a full complement, and must reach the beach before they lose everyone!<br/><br/>Gold Dice: These are played like any Red, White or Blue dice, but take the color of your choice, determined during the Final Tally. The box includes many ways to introduce Gold Dice to your game, and optional rules to make the most of them.<br/><br/>Special Missions: A simple expansion that adds a new layer to the game: Special Missions, which the players must accomplish in order to win. This must be done in addition to the normal objectives of the game (storm the bunker and survive for 1 turn). 1 Special Mission card is drawn at random at the beginning of the game, and the players will have to fulfill its requirements before reaching the bunker. Some will ask for specific Items to be found, or Specialists to be recruited (and sacrificed). Others will ask for specific RWB bonuses or even Awards.<br/><br/>War Heroes: 25 Specialist cards with a twist... each represents a real-life war hero of WWII! They work as replacement Specialists with slightly better abilities, so instead of rallying a Scout, for example, you can now rally &quot;Scout Tommy Prince&quot;. The rules include a small bio for each of these exceptional individuals, ailing from the various countries who fought for the Allied cause, like Canada, USA, UK, France, Scotland, New Zealand or Australia, and from the many cultures inside these countries, like African Americans, Japanese Americans, Muslim Pakistanis, Jewish French, Maori, Irish, etc.<br/><br/>",

        "description": "Six different games PLUS Rules to Link the Games PLUS East Front Campaign Game.<br/><br/>Tannenberg: Eagles in the East<br/>The vast majority of the German Army is arrayed against France and Belgium. Only a small force is left to hold off the Russian hordes in the east. German plans are to conduct a fighting withdraw from East Prussia. The Russian invasion causes the German commander to panic. Hindenburg replaces him, and bold plans are formed. The Germans take desperate gambles as they counterattack against two separate Russian Armies. Russian infighting and ineptitude lead to one of the greatest victories in German military history.<br/><br/>Galicia: The Forgotten Cauldron<br/>The main bodies of the Austro-Hungarian and Russian Armies face each other across the fields of southern Poland. Each side moves to attack and drive the other back. The Austro-Hungarian vacillation between different war plans creates confusion, but the fighting spirit of their professional Army produces initial success. Additional Russian armies join the fray and attack the weak Austrian right flank. A see-saw fight ensues, ending with an Austro-Hungarian retreat to the mountain passes protecting their heartland. Both sides now steel themselves for a protracted struggle that could mean the end of either Empire.<br/><br/>Serbia the Defiant<br/>Austria-Hungary invades Serbia as punishment for her role in the assasination of Archduke Ferdinand at Sarajevo. Since most of the Austrian Army must confront the Russians, the forces facing each other in Serbia are rather evenly matched. The Serbian Army, battle hardened by years of fighting in the Balkans, aggressively counters Austrian incursions. The Serbs fight for their national existence in one of the greatest &quot;David vs Goliath&quot; campaigns of modern history.<br/><br/>Gorlice-Tarnow Breakthrough<br/>With the front in France stalemated across no-man's land, the Germans redeploy powerful forces to the east. Their objective is to save Austria-Hungary from Russian pressure. Initial penetrations at the towns of Gorlice and Tarnow soon unravel the Russian defenses. A dramatic pursuit of the Russian Army across Poland ensues.<br/><br/>The 1916 Brusilov Offensive<br/>The brilliant Russian general Brusilov develops tactics to crush the Austro-Hungarian front lines. His bold plans call for wide-front assaults that prevent the concentration of Austrian reserves against any single thrust. The Russians destroy an entire Austro-Hungarian army and create a crisis that the Austrians and their German allies will have extreme difficulty containing. The Russians have the opportunity to win the war on the Eastern Front.<br/><br/>Romania: Transylvanian Gambit<br/>Russian successes bring the Austro-Hungarian Empire to the breaking point. The Romanians seize the moment to grab Transylvania from their once powerful northern neighbor. The Austrians have little left to hold off the Romanian invasion. An ad-hoc formation of Germans and Bulgarians counter-invade Romania from the south. Russia sends reinforcements to their new ally. Each side moves to seize and retain the initiative in an epic campaign.<br/><br/>CONTENTS:<br/><br/>    1680 Backprinted Counters (6 countersheets)<br/>    Four 34in x 22in Maps (4-5, 5-5, 6-5, 6-6)<br/>    Two 17in x11in Maps (4-5N, 4-5E)<br/><br/><br/>Scale is 20km / hex<br/>4 days per turn<br/>Unit Sizes: Division / Brigade<br/><br/>(from the publisher's website and user's description)<br/><br/><br/><br/>The Eastern Front: 1914-1917 FAQ",

Each player divides their total value by the value of the test tube their droplet is at on the test tube stand, and this number is added as VP to their final score. For example, if the chips in your bag and cauldron add up to 60, you would gain 4 VP if your droplet is at &quot;15&quot; (60 divided by 15), but if you managed to get your droplet all the way to &quot;2&quot; you would gain 30 VP (60 divided by 2)!<br/><br/>Green side: During the course of the game, players may buy VP with their shopping coins in addition to buying ingredients. The price for each VP for a player is determined by the value of the test tube their droplet is at on the test tube stand. Players may purchase as many VP each round as they want and can afford.<br/><br/>",

This massive rotting head of an ancient being may hold the secrets you need to get home. Question is, can you bring yourself to acquire them? Elude the brutal bacterial creatures roaming (and eating) this rotting fleshland as you wander eyeballs, tongues and teeth in your attempt to find and tap into this massive creature's memories and figure out just where in the universe you might be. Be careful though, this planet-sized noggin doesn&rsquo;t feature biology you&rsquo;re used to, and in your attempts to pull memories you may mistakenly tap into nerves or glands that could flood you with chemicals that wildly impact your emotional and mental state. Kaelyfos is Free on Kickstarter when you add Strannos to your pledge.<br/><br/>",

        "description": "Pack of promo survivors given to backers of the Zombicide Season 2 Kickstarter campaign.<br/><br/>Contains a total of 12 miniatures, survivor and zombivor versions of each of the following characters: Achille the Serial Killer, Chuck Momma's Boy, Mack the Car Salesman, Smith Dog of War, Mike the Miniature Sculptor, and Gary the Misfit.<br/><br/>- Achille is insane, a demented serial killer, and the zombies didn't change this. He would be a danger to any survivor if he hadn't decided to focus his murderous instinct on zombies. He finds being surrounded by potential victims that are actively hunting him terribly exciting. The human mind has nothing left to teach him. The zombie mind, however, even though it seems simpler, has an interesting potential. Well, you have been warned.<br/><br/>- Against all odds, Chuck has managed to survive the rise of the zombies. Living in his parent's basement, this 30 something man child's lack of real world experience hasn't been that much of a disadvantage, since there isn't much of a world anymore. Armed with a deep knowledge of zombie survival lore gleaned off videogames and the internet, Chuck is an unlikely, chubby ally - and possible food source if things get desperate.<br/><br/>- &quot;Gary, master of none&quot;, so people used to say. Gary didn't have a solid education and his demeanor seemed too &quot;cool&quot; to find reliable work and live in the mold of everyday people. He was almost a pariah when the apocalypse struck and shattered the &quot;everyday&quot;. Don't be fooled by his outfit: for his casual unconsern, Gary has done well on its own so far. Gary has always been a survivor, and the zombies didn't really change his habbits. If you're open-minded enough to see through Gary's disguise, he could trust you and share his precious tools of the trade.<br/><br/>- Mack's story is like most - an ordinary, happy man untill the zombies rose, forced to dig deep or die. His peacefull previous life hid his true potential - unfortunatly it took burying his wife and two daughters to bring it out. Taking a car from his lot, he began a cross country zombicide, eventually joining the motley crew of survivors. Mack's fighting spirit has made him a precious resource for any team, and his manic grin gets even wider the worse the odds are!<br/><br/>- Working with putty and tiny tools, Mike has been cooped up for years in his home studio sculpting miniatures for boardgames and the like. Obsessed with his craft, he didn't notice when his wife left and took his daughter with her, and he didn't notice the zombie apocalypse either! Well, that is, until he had to stab the mailman in the eye with a sculpting pick, and the wandered outside out of curiousity to find out what was going on. Mike now works with the other survivors, although they're a little disturbed by how much joy he seems to take in the fact that actual real zombies are &quot;finally&quot; running around.<br/><br/>- Smith mustered out of the special forces straight into private &quot;security&quot;, working all over the world for the highest bidder. Specializing in wetwork and asking no questions, Smith was in town for a contract when all hell broke loose. Fortunatly for him, and unfortunatly for the zombies, he had his arsenal stashed nearby. Though used to working alone, even Smith knows he doesn't have enough bullets to take on the zombie hordes by himself. Forced to cooperate with the other survivors, he's finding it hard on his limited social skills.<br/><br/>Each character has a unique set of gameplay attributes to give you a unique gaming experience.<br/><br/>",

As such, players will no longer have to photocopy the scenarios or remove them from the magazine prior to playing, and the new glossy paper for the 48-page magazine proper will significantly improve the brightness and clarity of articles therein. Using scenario card inserts also makes it easier to include other inserts, such as the player aids also provided in ASL Journal 10.<br/> ASL Journal 10 contents include the following:<br/><br/>     Scenario Replay of the Festung Budapest scenario FB17 Stalingrad Redux, with Phil Palmer, John Slotwinski, and Sean Deller;<br/>     Spencer Armstrong&rsquo;s When In The War? is a survey of date-dependent rules in table format;<br/>     Robert Wolkey aims to ease newbie pain in The Beginner Blues;<br/>     Bruno Nitrosso&rsquo;s Close Combat Simulator guides you to a better approach in CC;<br/>     Bret Hildebran&rsquo;s Son of Squad Bleeder is a DYO-esque trio of scenarios;<br/>     Aaron Cleavin explores low-odds FP attacks and Sniper tactics in Bullet In The Head;<br/>     Debriefing, this issue&rsquo;s errata updates;<br/>     The Umpires&rsquo; View editorial, with various deep thoughts from MMP HQ;<br/>     Frequently Asked Questions for Festung Budapest;<br/>     The Festung Budapest Player Aid Chart; and<br/>     16 ASL scenarios (printed on 8 x 11 inch cardstock):<br/>        J147 Into The Grinding Mill (Chinese vs Japanese, 12 September, 1937)<br/>        J148 Last Minute War (Hungarians vs Slovakians, 24 March 1939)<br/>        J149 Taking A Stand At Rosario (Americans vs Japanese, 22 December 1941)<br/>        J150 The Sangshak Redemption (British vs Japanese, 26 March 1944)<br/>        J151 Squeeze Play (Japanese vs British, 25 May 1944)<br/>        J152 Messenger Boys (German vs British, 2 August 1944)<br/>        J153 Dawn&rsquo;s Early Light (American vs German, 7 August 1944)<br/>        J154 Cradle To Grave (American/FFI vs German, 1 September 1944)<br/>        J155 It&rsquo;s Hardly Fair (Americans vs Germans, 20 September 1944)<br/>        J156 Mageret Mixer (Germans vs Americans, 19 December 1944)<br/>        J157 Rage Against The Machine (Germans vs Russians, 21 December 1944)<br/>        J158 It Don&rsquo;t Come Easy (Americans vs Germans, 15 January 1945)<br/>        J159 Tropic Lightning (Japanese vs Americans, 24 January 1945)<br/>        J160 Bienen Burnout (Germans vs Canadians, 25 March 1945)<br/>        VotG25 Urban Nightmare (Germans vs Russians, 28 September 1942)<br/>        FB18 Red Banner Days (Germans/Hungarians vs Russians, 26 January 1945)<br/>    <br/><br/><br/>ASL Journal 10 scenarios use the following boards and overlays:<br/><br/>    Boards: 4, 10, 11, 12, 13, 18, 24, 35, 39, 40, 41, 42, 44, 46, 48, 49, 50, 54, 56, 64, 65, 2a, 3a, b, c, d, FB(NE), FB(NW), VotG, x, y<br/>    Overlays: O1, O4, O5, OW1, Wd1, Wd2, Wd4, X11, X14, X15, X16, X18, X22, X27, X29<br/><br/><br/>",

As in Venice, the islands of Murano are separated by canals, so gondolas and transportation are at the heart of this game.<br/><br/>The game board depicts the islands of Murano, with the islands being divided up into building sites and walkways. Surrounding the islands is a series of action spaces, with gondolas being present in some number of them at the start of play. On a turn, you move one of the gondolas in the direction of play to an empty space, then take the action shown there. You can't pass another gondola while moving or land in an occupied space, but for a coin you can move a gondola that's in front of the gondola you want to move, and you can pay to move multiple gondolas, if needed.<br/><br/>Some actions place shops on the islands, with shops coming in different types. You mark a shop to show ownership, and when tourists show up later, they will shop at various stores depending on their proximity and the goods they offer. You also need to take actions to move your personal gondolas to islands so that you can take actions there.<br/><br/>Why are you doing all of this activity? To score victory point cards in hand, and actions on the board will let you gain additional VP cards to give you direction to your actions or let you profit from what you've already done.<br/><br/>You can also use some of the buildings to create glassworks, and those glassworks come into play on the VP cards, through tourist sales, and via an action space shown at the bottom of the game board image that lets you sell different types of glass for money.<br/><br/>",

You can score points by putting out cards of the same type together, but it's not that easy. Proactive management is required, as the type of cards played dictates the cards to be withdrawn next. Also, if you exceed the limit of the number of cards in your hand, you will lose points, so you will be worried about playing with a sense of tension from beginning to end.<br/><br/>&quot;R-ECO Recycle&quot; is a bluff game where you put out your hand face up or face down. If you put it in the appropriate area for each type of card, it will be a score card, and if you put it in an inappropriate area, it will be a loss card. The player who gets this score or loss is the last player to put a card in that area. There is less risk if you put out one face up card at a time, but you can't outsmart other players. Sometimes you can get a bigger return by playing multiple cards face down.<br/><br/>",

        "description": "This entry is for deluxe edition of Beyond the Black expansion, which also includes Drones Mini Expansion.<br/><br/><br/>Your galaxies have expanded to the extent of known space.  You overlap with your rivals and fight tooth and nail for fertile planets.  Now it is time to extend the horizons.  Now it is time to upgrade your ships to the limits of today&rsquo;s technology, and ready them with the brave pilots. Now it is time to go beyond the deep blackness of space into the truly unknown universe&hellip;<br/><br/>In Tiny Epic Galaxies: Beyond the Black, players have access to four new ships that they can upgrade their original ships to. To do this, they will need to hire specialized pilots. There are many pilots to hire, each possessing a unique special ability. Pilots are also specialized in what ships they are trained to use. Hiring the right pilot for a ship reduces that pilot's cost. The more ships a pilot is specialized in, the weaker their special ability is. Pilots are hired by spending unused dice that correspond with the four different ship types, and are worth victory points during play. Pilots are shuffled into a deck and splayed out like planets.<br/><br/>Additionally, Tiny Epic Galaxies: Beyond the Black introduces a press-your-luck exploration option for players. This allows players to venture beyond the planets and into deep space where they might encounter dwarf planets worth victory points, or rare materials that yield resources... or they may encounter cosmic threats like solar storms, black holes, and even supernovas. Either way, exploring deep space provides a player with exploration badges. These badges are tallied up at the end of the game and players are rewarded bonus victory points based on who has the most of a certain badge type. They are four types of badges to collect.<br/><br/>Tiny Epic Galaxies: Beyond the Black also comes with additional planets and new and exciting secret missions to explore!<br/><br/>",

The game evolves from strictly competitive to partially cooperative and at the same time from individually turn-based to semi-simultaneous. This new mechanics allows people to build alliances and to experience new strategies, while  saving time compared to the standard game duration.The basic mode for 6 players will be 3 teams x 2 players each, or experimental for now 2 teams x 3 players each.<br/>     The Stormgates allow for easier movement on the bigger map and will add some unpredicted event-bonuses to the players who use them.<br/>     The new Kings &amp; Queens mechanics will add more power to your deck and is an alternative strategy against the so called &quot;super-slim decks&quot;. The new cards will allow you also to build higher level cities - one level 6 capital and two level 5 residences (one summer and one winter residence per player).<br/>     Heroic mode will be added &quot;officially&quot; in the advanced scenarios section of the rules. In this mode players could use both heroes for simultaneous attacks possibly with increased moral bonus value - from 1 to 4.<br/><br/><br/>Two new non-player characters will join the game directly through the expansion box:<br/><br/><br/>     Bilkarr O'the Mountain people: the old and nice wanderer and herbalist, who could supply you with 6 powerful potion types (Colossus, Weakness, Freezing Touch, Solar Eclipsed, Brotherhood and Berserker), at reasonable price of course :) ... but you have to catch him on his never-ending trail.

We have recently changed our map style from hardback mounted (like the original Squad Leader maps) to a lightweight mounted map (that we use in our ASL Starter Kits). Realizing everyone may not be aware of the change, we decided to put a map (which will be in ASL Starter Kit #3) into the magazine to &quot;show it off&quot; to more ASLers. We included a scenario which uses the board, Marders not Martyrs. This map will be used in the Starter Kit games, but is also fully compatible with ASL. Look for it, and future, Starter Kit maps to be used in ASL scenarios.<br/><br/>Journal #7 contains articles on:<br/><br/>The Blue Devils - Croation Parachute Battalion <br/>Commissar's Dialectic <br/>Got OVHS?

        "description": "The War Stories expansion contains 6 modules that are completely independent from each other. They can be added individually or as a whole to the base game. They consist of:<br/><br/>War Stories: little scenarios that are written on a card, randomly drawn or chosen at the beginning of the game. These scenarios use tokens to add various effects to the game, like artillery fire, or to set specific objectives for the players, like trying to find dead officers on the beach. Some even simulate the rising tide or give the player added bonuses if they perform certain actions.<br/><br/>Legendary Units: Now, every player plays a historical unit that fought in the Normandy landings. Legendary Units come with their respective Legendary Specialists and Legendary Items, which are always available, but only to their respective Legendary Unit. Also, each Unit comes with its own set of RWB bonuses, adding a lot of replay value and variety to the game.<br/><br/>Poland: A 5th player color (black), with a full set of Specialists and dice (and its own set of RWB bonuses). This will give players either a new color to choose from, or the option to add a 5th player to the fray.<br/><br/>Servicemen: The Servicemen cards represent individual infantrymen that join your Unit for a while. Each comes with resources: on every Serviceman card, 2 or 3 dice results are shown. You can discard the Serviceman whenever you want to add his results to your Final Tally (this might help you obtain some RWB bonuses).<br/><br/>Last Man Standing: This module introduces a new way to play the game. Think of it as &ldquo;reverse D-Day Dice&rdquo;. You will be given a full Unit of soldiers at the start of the game, and then you will roll each turn to see how many you lose. Will there be enough men standing in the end to storm the Bunker? Includes a new Specialist (the Crackshot) and player aids with new RWB tables.<br/><br/>Campaign Mode: This giant scenario allows for massive games taking place on 6 Battle Maps with up to 8 players (each copy of the base game allows for 4 players, so you'll need 2 base games for 8). The 2 teams race to the top with various obstacles, objectives and special rules in this fun and chaotic competitive/cooperative version of the game, where players try to hinder the other team while having to help it at the same time.<br/><br/>The box also includes 6 Battle Maps centered around airborne operations (along with the Paratrooper Specialist, which now comes in a different version for every color, and the Pathfinder).<br/><br/>",
