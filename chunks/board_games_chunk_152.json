There are four levels of dice, each more powerful than the previous.<br/><br/>On their turn, challengers can choose to merge and/or unmerge their dice to change their power levels before rolling. Challengers can also play the Market and sell a dice pair in hopes of drawing a higher powered die from the bag. Playing the Market is a gamble though, because you could lose your dice and have nothing to show for them!<br/><br/>Strategy matters, but don't discount luck in this game, because special elements are activated when you roll doubles, and then weaker dice are able to overpower even the strongest of dice!<br/><br/>Defeat your opponent by rolling the higher value and you get to take one of their dice.

The game revolves around the excitement of discovering and eliminating characters through strategic questioning, all while attempting to outwit the opponent.<br/>Each player has a board with slots to place character cards facing away from the opposing player. The cards represent different dog characters. Players take turns asking alternate questions about the appearance of the opponent's chosen character. The questions help narrow down the possibilities, leading to the eventual identification of the hidden dog.<br/>The primary objective of the game is to be the first player to correctly identify the opponent's hidden character. Players do this by asking questions that help eliminate potential options based on the appearance of the characters. The winner gains a point and marks it on the slider to keep track of the score. The game combines deduction, memory, and strategic thinking as players try to unveil the mystery dog using clever questioning and reasoning. The catch is that specific questions about dog breeds are not allowed, but questions about fur color and other attributes are permitted.<br/><br/>",

Dealer then deals six cards to each player, three at a time. Each player looks at his cards and discards two. This continues until only the Mystery cards remain undealt.<br/><br/>Player to the Dealer's left leads by playing a card, then each player in turn must play a card of the same color (suit) if possible, otherwise he may discard any card. Highest suited card wins the trick. A player who cannot follow suit may play the Dick Tracy card on any Detective suit and win the trick; likewise the Gang Boss card wins any Gang suit trick. The player who wins the trick leads the next one. If a player leads with either the Dick Tracy or Gang Boss card, players may discard any card in their hand.<br/><br/>The player who wins the last trick collects the Mystery cards. Players then count all the Gang cards in their possession and score two points for each one. The player holding the Gang Boss card adds fifteen to their score, while the player holding the Dick Tracy card subtracts fifteen.

Activate special skills and be the last one standing to win!<br/><br/>Players take turns drafting heroes (from the 17 character cards included in the box) that they will use to battle their opponents. Each player shuffles a 54 card standard playing card deck (sold separately) and draws a starting hand equal to the value printed on their current character. They also draw cards equal to that character's LIFE value. Players will then pick one card from their hand to represent their starting POWER (1-10 cards have power equivalent to their numbers, while Jacks, Queens and Kings equal a power value of 11,12 and 13 respectively).<br/><br/>Players then take turns playing different suits and numbered cards in specific combinations to activate their character's own unique battle skills. These skills will either allow you to charge up your current battle power value even further, increase the rate of damage dealt to losing players at the end of the round, or any number of special abilities (like drawing more cards or dealing instant damage to an opponent).<br/><br/>Once all players PASS, everyone counts up who has the current highest power value. That player wins that round, dealing damage to every other player, equivalent to the current rate of damage! Those players must discard life cards equal to the damage rate. If a hero loses all of it's health, that player must switch to one of their reserve heroes. When all of your opponents heroes have been reduced to 0 health, you win the game!<br/><br/>",

        "description": "Sand Stacking is a pocket-sized dexterity game for 1 or more players that rewards precision and patience. To be successful, you will need a steady hand, an eye for balance and nerves of steel.<br/><br/>Stack tiny metallic cubes as high as you can (or as fast as you can) and see who comes out on top. You can build with either large (4mm) or small (2mm) cubes.<br/><br/>In the standard head-to-head game, you can go against any number of opponents, taking turns to create one tower - with the player who knocks the tower over as the loser. You can also play as a co-operative team to get as high as you can!<br/><br/>Alternatively, you can attempt to set records by building one tower on your own (official records are kept on sandstacking.com).<br/><br/>For most, Sand Stacking is a fun party game. For others, it can actually be a tool to help with meditation and focus. The game requires such a degree of concentration that meditation can actually be a part of the strategy!<br/><br/>One thing is for certain - sand stacking is for everyone!<br/><br/>&hellip;except kids under 12.<br/><br/>&mdash;description from the designer<br/><br/>",

The remaining take the roles of City Marshal, Judge, Neighbor, and News Reporter, called the &ldquo;Seekers.&rdquo; The Seekers move room to room while picking up 19th century equipment used for paranormal exploring.

Each room and noted areas is a &ldquo;Hot Spot,&rdquo; or haunting. <br/>Seekers gather equipment for capturing Lizzie&rsquo;s ghost moving room to room only by using marked doorways. Lizzie moves in secret using the &quot;Hot Spot&quot; location cards. By various means, the Seekers attempt to deduce and uncover Lizzie&rsquo;s location.<br/>A roll of the dice, a turn of a card, a decision to &quot;seek&quot; or &quot;hover&quot;- will a Seeker catch Lizzie's ghost and force her to admit her guilt?

        "description": "Vitals is a real-time cooperative dice-rolling game about working together as a surgical team.<br/>Players work together in real-time mimicking the atmosphere of an operating room to perform all of the tasks of the procedure while keeping your patient alive.<br/><br/>Teams are made up of 3 to 6 players consisting of the following roles: Surgeon, Scrub Tech, Anesthesiologist, (4th player) Circulator Nurse, (5th player) First Assist, and (6th player) Student Intern.<br/><br/>The gameplay begins by pulling a card from the Operation deck. Cards drawn from the operation deck explain the type of surgery about to be performed. It will show which side of the game board to use, what instrument cards will be required, and the locations of the surgery.<br/><br/>Each player assumes one role and works together to roll dice in real-time to perform their individual tasks needed to perform the operation. A core game concept is the Wellness button. This button needs to be pressed by one of the players when achieving their initial task at least every 15 seconds or the patient flatlines. This must be done throughout the entire surgery. If the patient flatlines, all players must stop what they are doing and roll the defibrillator dice and place the proper face on the defibrillator track next to the patient within 15 seconds to revive them. If the players succeed in reviving them, play continues. If they fail, the patient is lost and the players lose.<br/><br/>Roles:<br/>Surgeon (required) - This player rolls dice when working with tools. He must roll dice until he has the dice faces of the tool he is using. Once he meets the required faces, he may use the tool to perform the task and reveal the next tool needed.<br/><br/>Surgical (Scrub) Tech (required) - This individual rolls dice to match the tools the surgeon asks for. When they roll the correct dice faces, they may hand that tool to the surgeon.<br/><br/>Anesthesiologist (required) - This player rolls dice to check the vitals of the patient. They must alternate between checking temperature, heart rate, respiratory rate, blood pressure, oxygen saturation, and awareness. This player is responsible for keeping the patient alive when other professionals are tending to their tasks.<br/><br/>(4th player) Circulator Nurse - This player prepares the patient for surgery and collects tools to give to the Scrub Tech and Medical supplies to give to the Anesthetist.<br/><br/>(5th player) First Assist - Assists the surgeon in performing surgical tasks that require more than one person.<br/><br/>(6th player) Student Intern - Assists all players in dice rolling. This player has one of each die for all of the other players.<br/><br/>&mdash;description from the designer<br/><br/>",

Each player will need that many dice. A pen and paper is recommended for recording everyone&rsquo;s results, but these are not required. Count up all the sides of the dice that one player rolls, then multiply that number by five. That number is the finish line. <br/>2 Rolling: Roll your dice and record your total results. Roll your dice again add these results to your previous total. Keep rolling until someone meets or exceeds the finish line. <br/>3 Winning: If two cross the line at the same time, the one with the higher final total wins.

        "description": "In February 1915, the Germans launched an offensive in East Prussia designed to drive the Russians out of their last foothold in German territory. Despite the bitter cold and heavy snow, the Germans crushed the Russian 10th Army and secured a major victory though not enough to knock Russia out of the war as had been hoped.<br/><br/>Winter&rsquo;s Battle is a Campaign Study (a short book of scenarios and history) based on the Second Battle of the Masurian Lakes (we covered the First Battle in August 1914). The Germans, reinforced by newly-raised divisions and troops transferred from the Western Front, inflicted as many as 135,000 casualties including 80,000 prisoners taken, at a cost of some 32,000 of their own.<br/><br/>Winter&rsquo;s Battle adds 11 new scenarios to Infantry Attacks: August 1914, split into two chapters, each with a battle game to link the scenarios together. This being an Avalanche Press product, there&rsquo;s also the background story of the battle.

        "description": "Skylines: Air Traffic Control is a 1 to 4/5 player cooperative puzzle board game. Players take on the role of different ATC stations (Approach/Departure, Delivery, Ground, and Tower) and must undertake a shift at versions of some of the world&rsquo;s most iconic airports. Working together, players must deal with approaching and departing aircraft, represented by two individual decks of cards, and deliver varying flights to different locations both at and beyond the in-play airport, represented on the game board.<br/><br/>Players win the game if they can clear both the Approach and Departure decks without any safety hazards. At the basic level, hazards refer to safety protocols. If planes come into contact with one another, at any stage on the game board or on the approach/departure board, the game immediately comes to an end. In addition, players must deal with &lsquo;Hazard Cards&rsquo;, which emerge from both the Approach and Departure decks.<br/><br/>Skylines: Air Traffic Control is a 3D puzzle game. Players must exercise planning, communication, and cooperation to deal with the Approach and Departure decks and must show the ability to think several turns ahead of the current game turn to avoid catastrophic results that will bring the game to an end. The &lsquo;gamification&rsquo; of this puzzle is achieved through action rationing.<br/><br/>Players will carry out their limited number of actions simultaneously during a game turn by applying tokens, representing radio instructions, to the planes currently under their jurisdiction. Once the game turn is over (i.e., when each player has issued their instructions), the planes then carry out these instructions on the game board and approach/departure boards, with the responsible players moving the pieces along allocated taxiing routes, approach/departure vectors, and runways. Once the planes are moved (represented by meeples/miniatures), the next game turn begins and players continue issuing instructions to their planes under their jurisdiction.<br/><br/>Skylines: Air Traffic Control can be played solo, with one player taking on all ATC station roles, though works best with the full complement of four players. An option for adding a fifth player to a game exists. This is achieved by splitting the Approach/Departure station into individual player roles. The game is also expandable, and can be played with multiple groups of players representing multiple airports, using multiple copies of the game. In this case, the role of player five in each group takes on the role of an Area Controller. The Area Controller is responsible for routing planes between the two airports.<br/><br/>&mdash;description from the publisher<br/><br/>",

        "description": "Most of the naval battles in WW II weren't fought by big ships, but by small craft &ndash; torpedo boats, gunboats, subchasers, minesweepers, and the like. These battles aren't as well-known as the big fleet engagements like Matapan or Leyte, but the day-to-day patrolling, minesweeping, and convoying by these feisty small craft were just as important.<br/><br/>Pat Hreachmack has collected thirty-four surface actions involving these smaller coastal vessels. They are all historical and most involve only a handful of units.<br/><br/>These are short, vicious fights, usually between matched forces and were determined by the side with the better tactics. But there are also times when the victory conditions are to simply escape without being mauled or sunk. Many are in less-than-ideal visibility, with the two sides coming upon each other well inside effective gun range, sometimes with one, or both parties, surprised.<br/><br/>In addition to the scenarios, Clear the Coast! includes all the information on the ships, weapons, and sensors needed to play them using Command at Sea fourth edition rules.<br/><br/>&mdash;description from the publisher<br/><br/>",

        "description": "Covidbuster &ndash; A simulation about comprehensive Crisis Management of the&nbsp;COVID-19 Pandemic in Austria<br/><br/>Covidbuster is a cooperative serious board game for 1-4 players and was also designed for educational gaming by professionals. In the classroom Covidbuster is best suited for four player teams with 4 participants each and one gamemaster.<br/><br/>The game is based on&nbsp;AFTERSHOCK: A Humanitarian Crisis Game, and so those familiar with that game will recognize many of the mechanics. It is also inspired by core mechanics of virus spread used in the successful&nbsp;Pandemic&nbsp;game series.<br/><br/>Covidbuster has been developed 2020/2021 under real life restrictions caused by Covid-19 involving various professionals from public authorities and science. The project itself started as cooperation between the Austrian Military Academy and the game design label Tablewood Studios.<br/><br/>Covidbuster could be seen already as historical conflict simulation, which covers the first year of nation-wide crisis management after the outbreak of a new virus. It can be used as educational tool to remember the challenges the world was facing during the Covid-19 pandemic, but also to get into the topic as soon as a new virus gets viral. Note: After the Covid-19 pandemics is before the next pandemic.&nbsp;Societies are forgetting all too fast.<br/><br/>The key actors available with Covidbuster are the Health Authorities, the Civil Rescue Organizations, the Police, and the Austrian Armed Forces (Bundesheer), which&nbsp;play in that particular order.<br/><br/>Covidbuster demonstrates the complexity of nation-wide crisis management in Austria at different working levels during a pandemic linked with a simple, but still logical, infection rate. The actors should face the ups and downs of virus spread due to different factors like clusters, lockdowns, limited supplier markets, vaccine research, influencer conspiracies and a variety of other events which drives the situation. The dominant key player is the Health Services with the authority to put a general Lockdown in place (just once per game with a special card the actor has already at hand from the very beginning of the game). The military is the last actor during a game round, since it only acts by request of other authorities like Health Services or Police.<br/><br/>Instead of districts you have the whole state of Austria represented by the nine federal states (Bundesl&auml;nder). Each game plan for a federal state (Bundesland) includes a &ldquo;Corona-Ampel&rdquo; with four different colors (green-yellow-orange-red) reflecting the regional epidemic situation. The Corona-Ampel and the deck of Needs Cards are linked, since the colour of the Ampel increases the needs for critical supplies (+ 1 per type). Players assign teams to different tasks. There are special fields for certain events like Quarantine and Disaster Relief (e.g. due to avalanches or floods) to tie up operational teams.<br/><br/>The four types of supplies are related to the most critical groups of goods needed to manage the pandemic. White cubes stand for personal protective equipment. Blue cubes stand for &ldquo;disinfectants&rdquo; and other liquid resources like blood plasma. Green Cubes are any form of test kits and also include medication. Red Cubes stand for intensive care beds and include the whole technology linked to it (e.g. respirators). In the fourth month production facilities could be put in place representing domestic production capacities of critical items.<br/><br/>Since Austria is surrounded by eight neighbouring countries there is an Infection Plan for these countries, too. This plan also includes a &ldquo;Corona-Ampel&rdquo; related to the WHO representing the global pandemic situation. The Police and Military actors assign teams to border management which act as a blocker for the cross-border spread of the virus.<br/><br/>In each player turn there is an Infection Phase prior to the concluding Supply Phase by drawing infection cards to define the location of new infections like in the boardgame&nbsp;Pandemic. &ldquo;Pandemic Cubes&rdquo; will be placed on the Ampel of the effected &ldquo;Bundesland&rdquo; or &ldquo;Neighbouring Country&rdquo; and each color/cube stands for a reproduction factor of &ldquo;1&rdquo;. There are four &ldquo;Pandemic Cards&rdquo; in the deck which trigger an outbreak and could lead to chain reactions of viral spread.&nbsp;<br/><br/>Logistic and supply chain challenges are&nbsp;simplified by delaying the availability of supplies. With a logistic operation you get ordered supplies from abroad back home into your domestic warehouses. The exchange of items between players and the generation of production facilities is possible. There are certain events in the course of the game which will have an impact on the supply chain, too.&nbsp;&nbsp;<br/><br/>Cards, cards, cards: The card driven core mechanic needs a lot of playing cards. There are cards for coordination, events, needs and special situations (e.g. Media, Assessment, Social Unrest). In detail they differ very much due to the pandemic situation. Needs Cards (Bedarfskarten) include three different types refering either to a Regional Pandemic situation, a Corona Cluster or special situations like Corona Demos, Travel Warnings, Daily Commuters, Influenza Wave, Lack of Intensive Care Beds, Mask Refuseniks or Cov-Idiots.<br/><br/>The game lasts over 12 months/rounds. Playing time could be longer (5-8 hours), but the game system allows flexibility by reducing the playing time (3, 6 or 9 months) or even play it longer.<br/><br/>Players gain or loose&nbsp;&ldquo;Government Points&rdquo; &ndash; the final score could be &ldquo;good&rdquo; or &ldquo;bad governance&rdquo;.<br/><br/>Extra blank playing cards can be used to add new challenges or personal experiences of participants.<br/><br/>This serious board game had a print run of 20 copies (German edition).&nbsp;<br/><br/>Due to the geographical position of Austria in the heart of Europe with borderlines to many neighbouring countries it may be a game system attracted by a wider audience, since during the global Covid-19 pandemic domestic challenges have been quite similar to each other effected country.<br/><br/>Therefore the designer is looking for a publisher for an English edition to make Covidbuster also accessible for a wider audience.<br/><br/>",

Among your unique rival factions simply collecting Vnite will not be enough to save you, you&rsquo;ll need to conserve it, trade it, protect it, and even steal it to ensure you&rsquo;ll be the one to reign.<br/><br/>Story<br/>It's the year 2322, a century after the communication blackout with Earth, the once-unified Venusian cities have found themselves fragmented and divided. The collapse of the republic had given rise to individual city-states, each ruled by powerful factions vying for dominance and control. The valuable Venite resource drives the conflict, as factions fight for literal power and control.<br/><br/>Amidst this chaos, the International Innovation Station (IIS) thrives as a neutral entity, offering technological advancements to all factions. Its influence is immense, capable of shifting the tides of war.<br/><br/>But complications arise. The singularity, which once took hold of Earth, has found its way to Venus. It manipulates and controls some of the factions, adding an additional layer of complexity to the struggle for dominance.<br/><br/>In Cities of Venus: Civil War, you'll navigate the treacherous landscape of Venus mining Venite while leading your faction in the quest for supremacy. Alliances may come and go, as necessity drives your decisions.<br/><br/>Utilize the ever-evolving technologies offered by the IIS, but be cautious of their potential consequences. Balancing the acquisition of power and the practical implications of tactical battles will be vital to your success.<br/><br/>As you compete against rival factions, both controlled by players and influenced by the enigmatic singularity, your decisions will shape the future of Venus. Establish a new order, one that brings stability and prosperity, or plunge the world into further chaos and division.<br/><br/>Can you lead your faction to victory in this intense struggle for control? The fate of Venus lies in your hands.<br/><br/>&mdash;description from the designer<br/><br/>",

A pro-god-damn-wrasslin game that'll get over big, brother.<br/><br/>For those unfamiliar with the wild and wacky world of professional wrestling; welcome. In this biz, you're trying to Get. Over. Because to 'Get Over' means to win over the crowd, man. So now every time your music hits, the place goes bats**t wild! Because you're a freaking star, you hear? That's what this business is all about. It's about making stars, baby! It's not just about how well you can go in the ring, but how well you carry yourself out of it. To get over, you have to be the total package.<br/><br/>--<br/><br/>In this competitive 2-player game, opponents use deck-building and worker placement to pull off the match of a lifetime, reducing their opponent's health low enough to successfully pin them.<br/><br/>Card play is a kinetic recreation of the 'sport' you love (or maybe never watched). It's a seamless back-and-forth flow where momentum is key. It's not just about the physical battle, but the mental struggle to be able to tap into everything you've learned in training. In between card rounds, players take worker placement actions at the 'Mind Market,' a physical reconstruction of in-ring psychology.<br/><br/>Build your deck, choose your class specialty, hone your strategy and do whatever it takes to GET.

        "description": "In the early morning hours of March 9th, 1916, Pancho Villa launched an attack on the sleeping town of Columbus, New Mexico, and the adjacent US Army camp.  Villa&rsquo;s intelligence operation had failed.  Having ordered the men forward, he was unaware that so much of the US 13th Cavalry was at Camp Furlong that night.  After hours of confused combat in the streets and through the Army camp, Villa suffered many casualties and was forced to withdraw back across the border into Mexico, thus starting what would be known in America as the Punitive Expedition.<br/><br/>The Daring Escape of Pancho Villa is a tabletop miniature campaign which uses a moving battlefield design as the game engine.  The Villista Army is always on the board, executing their escape always in front of the players.  Instead of using a scrolling game mat or moving terrain around the wargame miniatures, the battlefield moves as the figures move.  The US player attempts to gain contact with the retreating band of Villistas and bring them to battle using an abstracted pursuit mechanism.<br/><br/>The battlefield itself is divided into four 2-foot by 4-foot separate game boards which are connected to form a moving 4x8 foot gaming surface.  They are then repositioned using card play to create a constant sense of movement as the figures move from town to town, cross railroads, through mountain escarpments and even cross a river.  Always trying to avoid Federales mounted patrols, garrisoned towns, and the United States Cavalry Regiments in pursuit.<br/><br/>If Pancho Villa can exit the final game board before the last card is drawn and played or avoid being killed or captured in the process, he escapes into history.<br/><br/>&mdash;description from the publisher<br/><br/>",

It aims to highlight underrepresented cultures and real-life historical locations through its authentic and stunning card designs.<br/><br/>Players are pitted against each other to gain the most money and commodities. They will visit different locations as they progress through the game and attempt to outbid each other on new stock. These items can be either sold for a profit, used by the player to protect themselves, or to gain an advantage over others.<br/><br/>Rounds are played in 3 stages: Location Phase, Auction Phase, and Player Phase. In each, players will grow their inventory and pad their pockets - but will have to watch out for tragedy rearing its head and stealing their fortunes.<br/><br/>&mdash;description from the publisher<br/><br/>",

Luis is a world class abstract game designer and the leading authority on OOSCGs (orthogonal only square connection games. That is, only horizontal and vertical, but not diagonal, adjacencies count as connections.)<br/><br/>Swaptimum is my most recent in a series of OOSCGs after a continuous, obsessive, months long design odyssey. Of my last 18 attempted OOSCGs, only five (Halfcut, Clump, Crisscross, Flipstop, and Swaptimum) survived Luis's scrutiny. Most either didn't work or were very similar to what had already been done, many by Luis himself.<br/><br/>",

In case of a tie, play another round.<br/>&emsp;<br/>COLLECTION GAME PLAY<br/>Players take turns being the farmer in charge of the silo, picking up a random seed and dropping it from the top of the silo. Prior to the drop, an opponent will change the deflectors. The farmer in charge hopes the seed lands in their hopper.<br/><br/>WINNING COLLECTION MODE<br/>The farmer whose hopper is filled or collects the predetermined number of seeds will win the game.<br/><br/>SEED CHARACTERISTICS<br/>Seeds come in various shapes and sizes. This gives each seed a slightly different property as they fall and deflect. As well, how you position or rotate the seed before dropping will change its &ldquo;flight&rdquo; dynamics.<br/><br/>DEFLECTORS<br/>When moving deflectors, ensure that the column beneath the drop location will have a deflector. Otherwise, a seed would drop without deflection to a predictable silo.<br/><br/>&mdash;description from the designer<br/><br/>",

        "description": "Fortuna et Victoria is a family game where players compete against each other to become the richest and most powerful being in a legendary universe. To accomplish this goal, players will hoard money and obtain properties to grow an empire, but also acquire troops, capture monsters and fulfill technological advancements.<br/><br/>The game is based upon a classical square design where players cast dice to move their pawns. Players can buy properties to extend their empire but they also have to keep an eye on other players, as opposite troops may attempt to shatter your power. Players may enter into conflict with one another and this is solved through card combat. You can hire troops or attempt to capture monsters that fight for you. You will have an edge to this combat if you can manage to discover one of the 18 technological advancements of the game. If you win, you keep your troops or monsters plus a large sum from the defeated player. Luck also plays a role in the game with plenty of random events, that may be of benefit or not.<br/><br/>There are several ways to win the game. First, players decide if they want a short or a long game. Short games have five different possibilities of victory including when all properties are bought or when a player captures the dragon. The long game has four possible outcomes including leading to bankruptcy to all other players or by possessing castles in all properties. The winner is the player that obtains the highest amount of money adding properties and other card values.<br/><br/>",

Battle for Poland, that took place September 1st to October 6th, 1939.<br/><br/>The game portrays dramatic clash between Poland and Hitler's Third Reich. It was the first introduction of what will be later called &quot;Blitzkrieg&quot; tactics. From military point of view, Poland was doomed from the start due to many reasons. Because of this, this story cannot be told without taking them into consideration. The biggest issue for Polish defenders was stubborn implementation of defensive &quot;Plan West&quot;. It assumed Allied intervention or opening of the second front days after the potential attack. Many flaws of the plan and pointless actions, if the circumstances were different, caused quick downfall of Polish defenders.<br/><br/>The story in this game is told mostly from the Polish perspective, introducing Polish propaganda, morale and General Staffs standpoint. All of this combined creates many layers of the campaign beyond simple hex&amp;counter wargame, which is crucial to the gameplay and makes Polish player really decide, how to play.<br/><br/>The game covers the whole campaign from it's start on the September 1st to the bitter end on October 6th and can be played in many ways, as a whole campaign or in series of smaller scenarios. Unit scale is division/regiment, 1 hex covers 10km of the real terrain.<br/><br/>&mdash;description from the designer<br/><br/>",

        "description": "LONDON: &lsquo;Twilight&rsquo;s Game&rsquo; &ndash; variations on a theme is a suite of Cold War themed strategy games using progressively building, but eminently simple, rules in which two or more adversaries seek to outmanoeuvre and/or best their opponents on a squared grid nominally representing the London of Len Deighton&rsquo;s and John Le Carre&rsquo;s twilight world of spy fiction.<br/><br/>In the basic game, two Players take turns to place and move their agents on a 54-square grid comprised of six 3-by-3 tiles.  There are three types of square:<br/><br/>     &lsquo;Normal&rsquo; locations (in the basic game there are forty these).<br/>     &lsquo;Black bag&rsquo; squares (there are eight of these, more than one on some of the tiles and none on a few others)      <br/>     &lsquo;Tube&rsquo; (London Underground) locations (the basic game has just six of these, all on different tiles.)<br/><br/><br/>More advanced variants of the game include the following additional types of space:<br/><br/>     Taxi spaces<br/>     London bus spaces<br/>     Telephone box spaces<br/>     Safehouse spaces<br/><br/><br/>The basic game is for 2 Players. The first variant allows 3 or 4 Players to play with accordingly different board configurations and some simple changes to the basic two-player rules.<br/><br/>Have you got what it takes to be the ultimate spymaster in the treacherous and murky World of Deighton and Le Carre&rsquo;s twilight city?<br/><br/>Components (the items needed to play):<br/><br/>     The Print &amp; Play gameboard tiles (available in the files section)<br/>     24 wooden playing pieces (tokens, pawns or blocks etc) [six each of four different colours]<br/>     The rules.<br/>     A set of numbered 'stickers' to differentiate an adversary&rsquo;s agents for some of the advanced variants in the Suite.<br/><br/><br/>Optional: a printed playmat picturing a map of central London onto which the gameboard tiles can be placed.<br/><br/>Objective of the game and how to play:<br/>In the basic two-player game the winner is the Spymaster who can manoeuvre three of their four agents off their adversary&rsquo;s edge of the board.  These spies are deemed to have infiltrated their opponent&rsquo;s agency (SIS or KGB). The 3/4-Player versions of the game bend these objectives slightly &ndash; although a choice is provided in the rules as to how this is done. Players take turns to move one of their spaces. The regular move is one orthogonal space. However, this can be extended in one of three ways:<br/><br/>        A spy moving onto a &lsquo;Black bag&rsquo; location has to move on quickly (they do not want to get caught!) &ndash; such a piece can move a further space, again only orthogonally.<br/>        A spy moving onto a &lsquo;Tube&rsquo; (London Underground) space may on a subsequent turn move from that space to any other &lsquo;Tube&rsquo; space.  They will then have the choice to remain in that new location or move a further space/spaces before completing their turn per the normal rules for moving.<br/>        A spy can make a &lsquo;jump-type&rsquo; move over an adjacent agent. Such moves still need to be orthogonal but can be &lsquo;chained&rsquo; for a spy to move longer distances and the pieces being jumped over can be one&rsquo;s own or an adversary&rsquo;s.<br/><br/><br/>Spaces spies are moved to must be vacant. No spy &ndash; friendly or otherwise &ndash; can share the same space.  (That would be poor Tradecraft!)<br/><br/>No diagonal move is allowed in the basic game and Players are not allowed to &ldquo;Pass&rdquo; their turn.  Nor can a spy's move be &lsquo;reversed&rsquo; in the immediately following turn.<br/><br/>A little information about the variants<br/>One of the more advanced variants of the game described in the rules allows for the elimination of enemy agents. A Spymaster skilled, or lucky enough, to kill two enemy agents automatically wins that variant &ndash; although there are further variants that allow for even this to be otherwise.  Spies can only be killed adjacent to &lsquo;Black bag&rsquo; locations.<br/><br/>Players cannot move an adversary&rsquo;s spies in the basic game.  One of the variants described however allows for this.  Further variants introduce additional types of space &ndash; for example the &lsquo;Taxi&rsquo; space allows a spy to move to any space within the same tile or to any space, depending on the value associated with the &lsquo;Taxi&rsquo;, up to 1-2 tiles away.  Another variant introduces &ldquo;values&rdquo; for the spy pieces and a further variant introduces the idea of &ldquo;missions&rdquo;.  There are twelve of these. For example:<br/><br/>      'One of your spies must visit two safehouses.&rsquo; <br/>      &lsquo;Each of your spies must travel at least once by bus.&rsquo; <br/>      'None of your spies must enter the central square of a tile.' <br/><br/><br/>Both the above variants provide options for introducing additional game mechanics reflective of a need for bluff and counterbluff intrinsic to the murky world of Cold War espionage activity.  For instance, the variant introducing the attribution of values to spies allows for pieces passing over an enemy agent to gain &ldquo;intelligence&rdquo; on that agent's value.<br/><br/>Players can choose which different variants and/or optional rules they wish to incorporate in their game play.  The game is suitable for Players aged 8 to 80+.

        "description": "Beat to Quarters, Vol IV (Under the Southern Cross) is an official expansion to Under the Southern Cross by GMT Games, LLC and requires a copy of that game to play.<br/><br/>One of the most common criticisms of the Flying Colors system is the clutter of status markers on the map and that they may detract from game play. This concern can be minimized somewhat by using status sheets and a handy pencil to keep track of things on paper. This, however, adds a separate record-keeping aspect that the design of the game goes out of its way to avoid.<br/><br/>Beat to Quarters provides the ultimate way by which to keep track of the status of individual ships through the use of individual tracking cards that are kept conveniently near the map and that are laid out to conveniently hold a variety of status markers such as Broadsides Fired, Sail State, Rigging Damage, and Hull Damage. The cards are designed to be printed at a standard 3.5 by 2.5 inch size so that they can be slipped into card protectors for extended usage.<br/><br/>Individual tracking cards are included for all 214 individually named ships included with Under the Southern Cross. But that&rsquo;s not all!<br/><br/>As a bonus, Beat to Quarters also includes the print-and-play components for an entirely new way to play Under the Southern Cross. Drawing from games such as Naval War, Modern Naval Battles, and (in particular) Enemy in Sight, Beat to Quarters can be played with just the ship tracking cards, a special set of markers and 8.5 x 11 inch tracking board, and the status markers from Blue Cross, White Ensign. The ship cards are organized into squadrons that maneuver and fire against the opposing fleet within a relatively small playing area. With Beat to Quarters, you can play the huge battles without the space requirements for several game maps.<br/><br/>NOTE: This volume of Beat to Quarters only includes marker sheets for the Argentinian, Brazilian, Chilean, Colombian, Peruvian, Portuguese, Spanish, and Uruguayan fleets.<br/><br/>With Beat to Quarters, you can either enhance or completely change your enjoyment of Under the Southern Cross!<br/><br/>&mdash;description from the publisher<br/><br/>",

This event triggers a modern-day gold rush, where people control drones and robots in their pursuit of gathering these valuable resources. The game is designed to cater to a wide range of players, from beginners to more experienced gamers, thanks to a scalable rule set that allows for increasing levels of complexity.<br/><br/>The gameplay revolves around players taking on the roles of drone and robot operators, each vying to collect as much of the precious metals as possible from the asteroid crash site and surroundings. The board is likely to depict the desert landscape and the crater left by the asteroid impact, with paths, obstacles, and various locations representing different resource-rich spots.<br/><br/>Players can expect to engage in a mix of strategic planning, resource management, and tactical decision-making. They might have to navigate their drones and robots through treacherous terrains, avoid hazards, and outmaneuver their opponents to secure the most valuable deposits. The game could involve elements of player interaction, such as competing for resources, blocking opponents' paths, or even forming temporary alliances.<br/><br/>What sets this game apart is its adaptability to different skill levels. The rule set can be adjusted to accommodate players' experience, allowing beginners and kids to jump in quickly while still offering deeper strategies for seasoned players. This versatility makes the game accessible and enjoyable for families, casual players, gamers and enthusiasts alike.<br/><br/>&mdash;description from the designer<br/><br/>",

        "description": "DustCollectorz - Champions Unleashed is a collectible trading card game introducing monsters from the world of Seraphia. The monsters have been trapped and turned into cards.<br/><br/>Players of the game have several game mode options. A two player fighting mode allows players to clash on any surface. A player starts the clash by attacking with a monster or monsters from a specific tribe and declaring which stat value will be used. The second player counters the attack with cards that can defend against it. Each card can have special abilities that can alter the course of the game. The player with the highest stat value wins the round and their cards are captured. The game is played until one of the players runs out of cards.<br/><br/>A second game play mode is a 2v2 four player team mode. In this game mode, there are three clashes per round. The team that wins two clashes wins the round. Cards are played until all of one player&rsquo;s deck and hand are exhausted.<br/><br/>The goal of the game is to have the highest number of points in a player or team&rsquo;s capture pile. Points can be earned by capturing creatures in clashes.<br/><br/>",

        "description": "Papa Tango gaming rules were designed to give players a feel for the PT actions that oc&shy;curred in the &quot;Slot&quot; around Guadalcanal during World War II.<br/><br/>No attempt was made at a naval simulation but instead the main design goal was that of a fast playing, fun, &quot;Beer and Pretzel&quot; type of game. A game that would give you an excuse to collect and paint up some PTs and Japanese naval craft.<br/><br/>A couple of different design techniques were use. As PT pat&shy;rols and actions almost always happened at night, part of the game would involve just trying to locate the enemy. This could best be accomplished having all of the players on one side and having the Japanese side run by a game master. The other unique design technique was the use of darts as the hit mecha&shy;nism for firing. I had watched a naval game at one of the first Little Wars conventions that use darts thrown at a silhouette tar&shy;gets and it was obvious that the players were having a good time tossing the darts. It just seemed that the game might be fun in&shy;corporating another popular game into the wargame.<br/> Game players are members of the &quot;Lucky Seven&quot; PT squadron, a fictitious squadron operating in the &quot;Slot&quot; during the Guadacanal and New Georgia campaigns during World War IL The squadron consists of 3-6 players operating with six PT boats. There are two replacement boats for boats lost in combat.<br/><br/>Each game consists of 10 patrols with each patrol lasting up to 20 turns.

        "description": "Commanded by Rommel, in May 1940 the 7th Panzer Division was one of the major units playing a major role in the success of the German plan to isolate the Franco-Anglo-Belgian army group on the North Sea coast. It forcibly crossed the Meuse in Belgium on 13 May at Dinant, breaking through the French 18th Infantry Division after a day of fighting. The French hastily committed their reserves in an attempt to contain the Germans. Two first-rank divisions were therefore sent to block the Panzer route: the reserve 1st Armoured Division and the 4th North African Division, which was stationed between Anor and Tr&eacute;lon, on the line of French fortifications near the Belgian border. Coming up against the 1st DCR, the 7th Panzer was surprised by the powerful and numerous French tanks (B1bis and H39), but after a few severe losses, the German tanks, which were more mobile and better coordinated, avoided a confrontation and left it to the well-directed German artillery to destroy most of the B1bis one by one, paralysed by a lack of information on the enemy's action and the rapid exhaustion of their fuel tanks. Faced with the 1st DCR, it was more the 5th Panzer Division that was engaged and momentarily halted. The latter therefore followed the advance of the 7th panzer division westwards, a little further north and with a slight delay. The 4th North African Division fought and sacrificed itself between Dinant and France; it more or less disappeared on 15 May, although some elements managed to return to France. At the end of the day on 15 May, the remnants of the three French divisions (18th DI, 4th DINA and 1st DCR) arrived at Beaumont and, retreating, crossed the French border again.<br/><br/>After clearing his route on the morning of 16 May, Rommel placed his forces between Beaumont and Sivry. It was then that the soldiers of the 84th Infantry Regiment, part of the fortified sector of Maubeuge, learned that the Germans were only a few kilometres away. Despite their initial optimism, they hardly had the means to stop the Germans, as this south-eastern section of the fortified sector consisted only of a line of light blockhouses, mostly equipped with automatic weapons. To the east of Maubeuge, only the fort at Boussois, although not completed, was a significant obstacle to the German advance.<br/><br/>After the 84th RIF's thin curtain of blockhouses, the Sambre was the last possible barrage before Rommel's panzer division and the 5th panzer division that followed a little further north reached Cambrai and crossed the rear of the Franco-British expeditionary corps engaged in Belgium. The French high command therefore decided to recall several major formations to try and stop the Germans on the Sambre. These included several well-equipped North African divisions and a motorised infantry division, but above all the 1st mechanical light division, the elite of the French cavalry. While the French arrived in scattered order to plug the gap and avoid being surrounded in Belgium, Rommel pushed westwards with his reconnaissance battalion, sometimes taking ill-considered risks.<br/><br/>Would the French arrive before Rommel on the Sambre, perhaps even managing to capture the fiery Wehrmacht general? Would the French tanks be up to the task of fighting the Panzers?<br/><br/>&mdash;description from the publisher<br/><br/>",

Starting in the 1700s, by law all leases would expire on the same day. The law has since been changed, but landlords and renters still stick to July 1st as the universal Moving Day. And since so many people are moving on the same day, it's of course near impossible to hire movers or even rent moving trucks on Moving Day - so everyone in the community shows up to help you move!<br/><br/>In Moving Day, your job is to pack all your stuff nicely into the available vehicles, trying to avoid crushing lighter items by putting heavier items on top, while also assigning people from the community to each vehicle. Some of them are pretty clumsy and might break fragile items if you are not careful, but perhaps if they are bringing delicious food with them, it might be impossible to turn them away...<br/><br/>On your turn, choose a set of two item tiles and one person card from a general display, and then assign them to your vehicles. But be aware that your vehicles have limited space and different shapes, and you must fill the items from the bottom to the top. People also have different strengths and should ideally be strong enough to collectively lift your heavier items.<br/><br/>After eight rounds the game ends. Each player now has sixteen item tiles and eight people cards assigned to their vehicles, and they calculate their score:<br/><br/><br/>     Heavy items on top of lighter items break the lighter items below.<br/>     Clumsy people will break fragile items.<br/>     Heavy items score more points than lighter items.<br/>     Score extra points for adjacent items of the same shape.<br/>     Score extra points for adjacent items of the same type.<br/>     Food tokens are also worth 1 point each!<br/><br/><br/>The player with the most points wins!<br/><br/>",

        "description": "Rise of the Trackers: A Fireflies Trilogy Game is a board game based on the imaginative world brought to life in the Fireflies Trilogy books by Melissa Koberlein.<br/>&nbsp;<br/>This game is played collaboratively between 2-6 players against both time and the deck. Players choose their characters, and each become a &quot;Tracker&quot;, a human hosting alien symbiotes called chondria. This relationship grants the player unique abilities resulting in varied attributes that aid the player on their journey to both find other humans that are compatible with chondria and assist in successfully bonding the compatible human and chondria together. In this symbiotic state, both the chondria and human thrive, developing new and elevated skills from the purely human state. <br/>&nbsp;<br/>This task is made difficult by the fact that bonding can have complications. If a bonding is attempted on an incompatible human, that human and the chondria die. Additionally, a compatible human still must be willing before successfully becoming a host. If a compatible human is unwilling and a bonding is attempted, their body and the chondria become at odds, and they turn into &quot;Razers&quot;. While a Razer remains alive and hosts living chondria inside their body, they also become unresponsive and lose control of their human selves. Their consciousness is now influenced/responsive only to the host that bonded them against their will. In this race against odds, a team of Trackers is on a mission to find more compatible humans and convince them to become a host to this incredible alien species. <br/>&nbsp;<br/>Malcolm Durst, however, is a host with a sinister mission: Create more razers to do his bidding. He uses the vulnerability of the Razers to prevent the growth of healthy hosts and grows a force of Razers under him to amass power and control in the world. He and his daughter, Lilah, have to be stopped before their control of Razers gives them unrestrained power to see their plan to fruition.<br/>&nbsp;<br/>In this turn-based board game, players move around the board working together in making decisions that influence themselves, their fellow Trackers, Allies, and Enemies. The Trackers must work together to reveal if a human is compatible, use their unique attributes in various combinations to convince them to be a willing host, and bond them into an Ally that can aid in their mission to stop Malcolm and Lilah. As game play progresses, Trackers can be hindered or boosted by characters or their environment via the deck, and an enemy turn every round works to progress Malcolm&rsquo;s mission. Players win when they have created enough Allies. However, if Malcolm accumulates enough Razers first, or if too many humans dies from incompatible bonding, the Trackers lose.<br/><br/>&mdash;description from the designer<br/><br/>",

Watch-out! your not alone. few experienced assassins want his head too and will do all the necessary, even by take you down...<br/>Make your wise choices to assassinate disturbing guards, get some 'clues' from civilians, find useful objects and treasures and locate the Wanted before them.<br/>But remember, one wanted won't make you a legend...<br/><br/>Instructions(summary):In a small medieval town shown on the game board and divided into zones, the participants distribute the various game tokens, 6 in total: citizens, guards, objectives, event, bargain and tower.<br/>The 'Citizens' and the 'Guards' are placed with their faces up and the others upside down. Each player in turn has the right to choose a face-up token and act according to the roll of the dice. Civilians will reveal info to you so you could flip a face-down token in the same area but be aware - an bad die may also kill them (3 kills of a civilian will get you out of the game). Killing 'Guards' will get you victory points according to the guard rating. 'Bargain' are also victory points but they can be used for bribery. 'Target' will allow you to choose another player and try to rob or eliminate him but also to locate the 'wanted'. An 'Event' will allow you to cause an 'Accident' and instantly eliminate a 'Civilian', 'Guard' or other player (can be useful) and the 'Tower' will allow you to peek at face-down tokens.<br/>The game ends when one of the players finds the 'Wanted' or alternatively if the other players are disqualified (killed too many civilians or were killed somehow). A player who found the 'Wanted' will win 5 victory points.<br/>At the end of the game, victory points are counted and the winner is announced.<br/><br/>",

Each child gets 5 pieces of one color made of wood. 4 of these are set up on the base plate at your own station. The dice are rolled in turn. The player with the highest score may then turn the game disc so that the first wheel of the locomotive is at his station. Then the starting player rolls again. With the number of points now rolled, the game is played as follows:<br/><br/>     First, a token is placed on the rails in the direction of the arrow for the number rolled.<br/>     Then the locomotive continues in the same direction for the same number of points.<br/><br/><br/>If the wheels of the wagon of their own color are on the same track space as their token, the player with that token may board the wagon. This also applies equally to all other players. The child who was first to place four game pieces in the wagon of the same color wins.<br/><br/>&mdash;user summary<br/><br/>",

Get ready to delve into the depths of niche interests and expand your geeky horizons in this unique twist on the classic Top Trumps game.<br/><br/>Just like its traditional counterpart, Topic Trumps follows a simple yet addictive gameplay formula. Each player receives a hand of topic-themed cards, with each card containing open-source researched stats.<br/><br/>The objective of the game is to outdo your opponents by comparing specific attributes or statistics of the topic cards. These attributes may vary depending on the theme, but they could include factors such as speed, weight, firepower or even something completely odd and obscure. Players take turns challenging their opponents by selecting a specific attribute from their card and pitting it against the corresponding attribute on their opponent's card. The player with the highest value for that attribute wins the round and collects the opponent's card.<br/><br/>However, what sets Topic Trumps apart from its traditional counterpart is its inherent educational value. All stats and values in the deck have been researched in open-source material - arming you for any pub-quiz or trivia night!<br/><br/>Players get to explore and learn about various geeky topics that they may not have encountered before. Whether it's discovering fascinating facts about rare chemicals, fantasy characters, curries of the world or taking a crash-course in wine or maybe unraveling the intricacies of micro-computers of the 1980s, Topic Trumps is an excellent way to immerse yourself in new, old and exciting subjects.<br/><br/>In addition to its quick gameplay and educational value, Topic Trumps takes learning to the next level with an innovative feature: each card is equipped with a QR code that links to a wealth of information about the specific topic it represents. By scanning the QR code using a smartphone or tablet, players can find out more about their favourite card.<br/><br/>&mdash;description from the designer<br/><br/>",

        "description": "UMS: Modern Age is the first adaptation written using the &ldquo;core&rdquo; of UMS, a set of rules originally developed in Italian and then translated into English whose ambition is to cover the conflicts of the contemporary era (2015+) and other modern historical periods as well.<br/><br/>The scale is 28 or 20mm and the base unit is the Squad/Team or the single vehicle. The structures and equipment of the units mirror the ones from armies of NATO, Russian (former Warsaw Pact), Middle-East, Africa and irregular/insurgent ones. D12s are used to resolve firefights and all others checks such as moral and activation ones. The minimum table size is the standard 120x180Cm, but larger ones can be used too!<br/><br/>Clashes between superpowers armies, local conflicts between Warlords, symmetrical or asymmetrical operations, raids &hellip; all this can be played on using the guidelines offered by the rulebook.<br/><br/>UMS: Modern Age gives the players rules for managing a ground battle with vehicles, aircrafts, helicopters and artillery supports. Players will also find generic army lists with a point system and scenarios, or missions, to be used for a quick game among friends. This does not take away the possibility for players to being able to create custom scenarios inspired by historical events of the last decade.<br/><br/>&mdash;description from the designer<br/><br/>",

By adjusting the ratios you can utilise the figures you have available.<br/><br/>I have deliberately avoided laying down tedious minutae of law. Your interpretation of history is what makes for an enjoyable replication of events as you understand them. If you are lucky, you will find a like mind or at least a tolerant collaborator.<br/><br/>You will notice that the tables have been kept very basic; for example, superior armour. This way you or an umpire can decide by comparing the units engaged, without recourse to pluses or minuses for breastplate, helmet, tassetts etc. If in doubt ignore it.<br/><br/>The ratio of pikemen to musketeers always causes controversy. If you do not have any accurate idea for a particular battle, then it may be helpful to know, that it is generally accepted that Parliament as early as 1642 reached 2 musketeers to I pikeman. The Royalists probably attained this by late 1643. In Scotland the ratio of 3 musketeers to 2 pikemen appears to be more common.<br/><br/>Finally, nothing is written in stone here, but keep to the spirit of the period, avoid gamesmanship, be prepared to lose graciously or be generous in victory.<br/><br/>&mdash;description from the designer<br/><br/>",

        "description": "Welcome to Flex Office! At Flex Office we offer our employees hybrid work options: work from home or in the office. Each player is a Team Leader of eight enthusiastic colleagues.<br/>As a Team Leader, your job is to keep your team motivated. For best team morale, you provide the best workplaces in order to score the most points.<br/><br/>Every workplace is worth points, because the available workstations in the office are limited. The Team Leader with the most occupied workplaces (laptop cards) in an office space, gets the points associated with that office space. However, the competition for the best workplaces at Flex Office is so fierce, that your laptop may end up with the Clean Desk Officer if you haven't protected it!<br/><br/>Flex Office is a game that takes place during an 8<br/>hour working day. Every hour is a game round and after 8 game rounds the players run out of cards in their hands. Then the points are counted, after which the Flex Office closes its doors for the day.<br/><br/>&mdash;description from the designer<br/><br/>",

In this journey for survival, you will rise to the challenge of an unfortunate crash landing, navigate volatile terrain, fend off agitated native scavengers and craft radio parts. As dusk falls on the third day, you either radio home and triumph over adversity as a team, or you die a hot, miserable death under volcanic rubble.<br/><br/>Radiocraft is a medium-weight, cooperative strategy game designed by Cathedral Games. Each in-game day contains multiple rounds. During each round, commanders will each choose a primary and secondary action set to take - giving direction to cadets, negotiating trades, producing key materials needed for survival, planting and harvesting fruit, extinguishing fires, upgrading abilities, and attracting new recruits to the cause. Actions you take are required for survival and also for experience-building in crafting the radio parts required to radio home. Each action set is distinct and requires planning ahead to produce a successful outcome. After each player takes their turn, the round ends and end-of-round events occur - fire from volcanic activity spreads, scavengers move from tile, to tile, which initiates combat, and gardens grow. By sunset of each day, players must ensure that cadets are under their care or protected at supply camps and enough fruit is collected to survive the next day.<br/><br/>&mdash;description from the publisher<br/><br/>",

Play as one of many lands, whether they be high, low, wet or frozen. Move your cards into spaces like chess pieces, and gain favor by collecting one or more of the five terrain tokens.

Each of the 18 characters becomes a hero, and the game unfolds dramatically.<br/><br/>Simultaneous movement, map exploration, card combos, resource management, dice combat, and more. In addition, there is reasoning and gamesmanship with visualized search chips.

        "description": "Frontiers on Fire is a man-to-man skirmish wargame for warfare in 18th Century North America, mostly the French-and-Indian War and the American War for Independence. <br/>Too many skirmish games are simple systems where dice take a greater role in the game than tactics, decisions, or careful use of fire and movement. <br/>Frontiers on Fire allows each player to control a half dozen or so men, but takes some of control away from the player through model/character reactions to the players&rsquo; plans and to the situation the characters face. <br/>Skirmish games often have difficulty making a playable and interesting game while depicting realistic ranges, movement distances, and time. <br/>Frontiers on Fire uses a short turn (the time to load a musket) and ranges experienced by those fighting in the Eighteenth Century, not parade ground and firing range optimums. Percentage dice for shooting means many subtle  factors can be taken into account, with a separate d10 for the effects of an effective shot. Hand-to-hand is by opposing d6, but even melee allows for tactical choices in the fight. <br/>Each turn, each model is secretly given an order chit such as fire, load, walk (and shoot if loaded or if pistol- or bow-armed), run, etc, although the particulars are defined only when the model activates in a randomized order with other models or groups of models. <br/>Leadership and group rules allow some co-ordination of actions and timing. <br/>Special events account for unusual occurrences and can both benefit a player, or interfere a good plan. <br/>The game system, as written, works for 54mm or 25/28mm figures, and 15mm models can be used if the ranges are adjusted. Frontiers on Fire&rsquo;s author is a professional historian, specializing in the 18th Century, who also has decades of wargaming experience. <br/>The rules have been extensively play-tested by both veteran and novice &lsquo;gamers. <br/>Frontiers on Fire provides realistic, challenging, playable, enjoyable, and even dramatic games.<br/><br/>Sequence of play:<br/><br/>     1) At the beginning of a turn, secretly choose an action chit for each character. Place the action chit face down on the character card or under their base.<br/>     2) Roll 1d10 per force for activation sequence. Record results. Re-roll ties but stay within relative sequence to other forces with different rolls.<br/>     3) Using the sequence just rolled, each force takes turn activating one character &lsquo;on point&rsquo; (must be done before any group moves) OR any one group with a leader OR any stragglers (stragglers can only be activated after ALL group moves)<br/><br/><br/>&mdash;description from the publisher<br/><br/>",

        "description": "The Portable Wargame evolved over several years, and the first book about it was published in 2017. Several more have followed, and the rules have proven popular with wargamers who want to fight battles on a regular basis but who resources of time and space are limited.<br/><br/>Over time, several variants have been written, some of which have been published. The most recent innovation has been the development of the Fast Play 3 x 3 Portable Wargame (FP3x3PW for short), which uses a three-by-three gridded tabletop and a maximum of six units (plus a general) per side. Since this new version of the rules was launched in early 2022, it has sparked a lot of interest and has generated a rapid growth in new sets of period-specific rules.<br/><br/>The Portable Wargame Compendium has been compiled from contributions from members of Portable Wargaming community. The Compendium has been edited by Bob Cordery and includes contributions from David Barnes, Justin Barrett, Bob Cordery, Mark Cordone, Arthur Harman, Marc Pavone, Martin Rapier, and Mike Taber.<br/><br/>98 pages includes - Snakes and Ladders Campaign System and Wargame Rules for Original 3x3, Fantasy, 18th Century Horse &amp; Musket, Colonial &amp; Late 19th Century, WWII Eastern Front Infantry, WWII Operational, 1st Punic War, English Civil War, Little Wars, and Sci-Fi.

Use your navigation skills and firepower to send your enemy to the briny depths. Or find a hidden trove of treasure before they do. And try to avoid piratey perils like scurvy, Voodoo curses, a mutinous crew, and a very releasable kraken.<br/><br/>Gameplay Overview:<br/>You and your enemy each control a fleet of 5 pirate ships on sea grids hidden from each other&rsquo;s view.<br/><br/>The primary goal of the game is to track down and destroy your enemy by sinking their ships. A secondary goal (a greedy pirate side quest, if you will) allows you to win by hunting for treasure.<br/><br/>The deck of cards contains tools and tragedies for you and your enemy, but what you'll draw is a mystery.<br/><br/>Start each turn by drawing 1 card. Then, chose 1 of 7 available actions, ranging from offensive to defensive.<br/><br/>Islands provide shelter and a chance to use certain advantageous cards.<br/><br/>Doubloons allow you to extend your turn and amplify your power.<br/><br/>If you&rsquo;re smart, you&rsquo;ll keep track of your enemy&rsquo;s movements on your Sea Chart.<br/><br/>How To Win:<br/>There are two ways to win the game:<br/>- By sinking 3 enemy ships. If at any point either you or your enemy has 3 sunken ships, the game ends. This includes ships that sink by means other than a direct attack. The person with more ships afloat wins. If both you and your opponent simultaneously have 3 sunken ships, it&rsquo;s a tie.<br/><br/>- By completing a Treasure Hunt. If at any point you or your enemy successfully complete a Treasure Hunt, the game ends and that person wins.<br/><br/>",

The game includes a 10x10 game board, 100 chips, player game pieces, a die, a drawstring bag, and an instruction sheet. The objective is to outmaneuver your opponents while trapping them and becoming the last player with available moves.<br/><br/>Players start by rolling the die to determine the first player. The game proceeds clockwise, with each player strategically placing their game piece on the board and then selecting one of three chips from the bag to determine their move. The game revolves around five different chip moves, each with its own rules and restrictions. These chip moves dictate how players can move their game pieces on the board, whether it's a simple one-space move, a complex diagonal maneuver, or the ability to jump over obstacles.<br/><br/>The goal is to strategically use your chips to outwit your opponents, block their movements, and avoid getting trapped yourself. Once a player can't make any more moves, they're eliminated from the game. The last player remaining with available moves emerges as the winner of TrapMove. With its combination of strategy, skill, and a touch of unpredictability, TrapMove promises an engaging and fun gaming experience for friends and family alike.<br/><br/>&mdash;description from the publisher<br/><br/>",

Spurred on by promises of fortune, freedom and territory Americans from all walks of life set out for the untamed lands west of the Mississippi River. This rapid expansion brings with it camps, towns and cities, some popping up overnight and disappearing just as quickly. Vast railway networks are built to connect the ever-expanding country. The vast swathes of land prove difficult to control; attracting criminals, runaways and renegade Indians. The expansion westward is accompanied by law and disorder as state and federal lawmen take up the badge to hunt down criminals.<br/><br/>Crime and murder rates are high. Amidst this lawlessness the states earn their nickname: &quot;The Wild West.&quot; Justice is meted out with sixgun, shotgun, and hangin&rsquo; rope. In the turmoil some lawmen turn outlaw, and some outlaws turn lawmen. Loyalty to anything or anyone is fleeting and life is cheap. Some outlaws and lawmen become legendary heroes and villains in United States folklore.<br/><br/>In Shoot N' Skedaddle players will take control of outlaws and lawmen, battling for supremacy amongst the cow towns, railheads and mining camps of the Old West. Will you blaze a trail of crime and mayhem? Will you take up the tin star<br/>and uphold the law?<br/><br/>&mdash;description from the publisher<br/><br/>",

At the start of the games, the players decide how many rounds you need to complete in order to win.<br/><br/>On you turn you roll one die at a time, hoping to get a sum as close to, but not over, 7. If you stop rolling dice while your sum is not over 7, you move the sum multiplied by the number of dice. If your sum gets over 7, you go back to the start space.<br/><br/>If your piece lands on top of another piece, you take control of their next move, and in that move they will bring you along with them (you become a parasite (which is the origin of the name (in Danish, &quot;snylter&quot; means a parasite, and &quot;at snylte&quot; means to parasite))). If they bring you all the way around the board, you will also get the point for it instead of them.<br/><br/>As mentioned, first player to reach the agreed-upon number of points wins.<br/><br/>",

Focusing on the Post-Classic period, the rules and armies in this book give you all you need to play games set during the rise and domination of the Triple Alliance all the way to the arrival of the Spanish. With gameplay that is intuitive and easy to learn, any player can jump right in and start their journey through this lush time period and setting, and the rules allow for great creativity in scenarios and campaigns.<br/><br/>Simple enough for new players to grasp but also complex enough to entice veteran gamers, Obsidian Empires use a novel mechanic to represent battles in the time period: Focusing on the Core Forces mechanic, Mesoamerican armies all have a common pool of Units that they can utilize, but each specific Faction brings unique bonuses, strategies, and sometimes, unique Units that make each Faction distinct. Gameplay is also kinetic, there is no sitting around here, and all players are active in each and every Step of the game. Each roll is meaningful, and with a focus on a single die for most rolls, there is no time wasted counting dice or figuring out needlessly complex formulas.<br/><br/>The book includes army lists and special rules for:<br/><br/>Aztec (Triple Alliance)<br/>the largest empire in central Mexico, this Faction emphasizes melee and close-quarter battles, but due to their military expertise, they can bring forces in from flanking maneuvers, and due to their size, they even have a free Unit to capture their dense population.<br/><br/>Purepecha<br/>the second largest empire to the west of the Aztecs, the Purepecha were famed for their keen-eyed marksmen, utilizing range combat to stymie their foes, but each Purepecha bow was so well-constructed, it could even act as a weapon in melee.<br/><br/>Tlaxcala<br/>An isolated City State to the East of the Triple Alliance, after years of warfare, the Tlaxcala were bitter enemies of the Aztecs. Renowned for their fervor in combat, they relied on a balanced force that could maximize advantages both from afar and close.<br/><br/>Huastec<br/>a City State of Mayan descent to the Northeast of the Triple Alliance near to what is today known as the Gulf of Mexico. The Huastec have been slowly losing their southern territories to the Aztecs, but their tenacity and expertise with spears is legendary. They were steadfast fighters that would rather die on their feet than flee than the enemy.<br/><br/>Spanish<br/>the first Europeans to begin the task of conquering, colonizing, and converting the native population, the Spanish were often outnumbered hundreds to one, but thanks to their Tlaxcala allies, they were able to utilize the advantages of gunpowder, steel, and horses. Unlike other forces, the Spanish did not fight to claim captives but rather to seek gold and glory.<br/><br/>&mdash;description from the publisher<br/><br/>",

        "description": "To the Ends of the Earth's motive is from the bible story at the Acts of Apostles. In short, this game stands on the history which is the apostles' effort to spread the Christianity to the world after Jesus' ascension. Even though the new game is based on the bible story, we tried to design the new game feeling like the movie &quot;Ben Hur&quot; which is a masterpiece for ordinary people.<br/><br/>In this game, each player becomes one of the apostles and travels to an extensive area from Jerusalem to Rome. And then they record a gospel based on Jesus' teaching and try to start an evangelism to Jewish/Gentile community in the world. They establish their Church in the world and spread the Gospel with other players to the ends of the Earth but identify who is the best apostle.<br/><br/>This game's rules are simple and easy to learn, even if someone is a child, but during playing the game there are some select options. So, for the victory, each player should make a good strategy. However, the game has some lucky elements. Therefore, players will be able to enjoy the game well because the game's feeling isn't just super heavy and serious!<br/><br/>&mdash;description from the publisher<br/><br/>",

        "description": "Dragon Bowl is a fantasy-themed board game made for bowling. Players take the game to the bowling center, set it up on the back table, and bowl to drive the game mechanics. Players, heroes, travel across a perilous landscape battling creatures and overcoming challenges on their way to defeat the marauding dragon and save the Kingdom.<br/><br/>Dragon Bowl takes the focus off of the bowling score and emphasizes shot-making. With six different bowling skill levels, beginner to pro, any level can play at the same time and anyone can win. A beginning bowler can defeat a pro bowler in Dragon Bowl.<br/><br/>Players select a hero and the skill level (based on bowling average or typical score bowled) at which they will compete. Heroes travel across a kingdom overrun with fierce creatures. When a player encounters a creature, she notes the creature's strength (denoted on an encounter card ranging from 6,8,10, or 12). Based on that strength, she roles the x-sided die to determine how to defeat the creature.<br/><br/>Ex: A beginning bowler encounters a creature with strength 8. The beginning bowler roles an 8-sided die. The result is 5. To defeat the creature, the beginning bowler must knock over at least 5 pins with two balls in the bowling frame. An intermediate bowler would also roll the 8-sided die and have to knock over the resulting number of pins on their first ball to defeat the creature. Each subsequent skill level takes the difficulty to another level.<br/><br/>There are six creature encounters, three defined bowling challenges, and the final battle against the dragon, which consists of overcoming a unique Victory Combo.<br/><br/>In addition to the bowling component, each hero has a unique special skill they can use once or twice during the game. One hero can skip an encounter once during the game, while others can retake a shot or add +1 to their pin count or even steal another hero's die roll. <br/>   <br/>The game is designed to be played in the bowling center, but we do have people playing at home using some other bowling game like wii bowling or even a phone app.<br/><br/>&mdash;description from the designer<br/><br/>",

        "description": "Players play as rulers, each having a piece on a looping trail. At the beginning of the game they each receive 70 coins, and roll in order to play. There are three types of cards next to the board: property cards (that show the property name, its value and its tax amount), soldier cards (that show the name of the unit, its value and its power rating), and chance cards (that need to be shuffled and put faced down next to the board).<br/>On the board there are properties, soldier barracks and churches. When a player lands on a property, they can purchase it. When a property is purchased, if any other player lands on it, they have to pay the landlord a tax (written on the property card); also if the owner themselves lands on the property, they get that same amount from the treasury. The church tiles are chance tiles, and if a player lands on them they will have to draw from the chance cards. They can gain or lose coins from the chance cards.<br/>The goal of the game is to get soldiers and gather an army. When a player lands on a soldier tile on the trail, if they have the required coin, they can add that soldier to their army.<br/>The game ends when all the properties are sold, and the winner is the person with the most powerful army. The property value and the remaining coins are inconsequential. If the player with the most powerful army owes coins to the treasury or another player, they cannot be the winner and the second most powerful player will be the winner.<br/>The visuals and the art style, as well as soldier units and properties, are themed around the Firefly Studios' 2002 real time strategy game &quot;Stronghold Crusader&quot;.<br/><br/>",

        "description": "VOID is a tactically-satisfying cooperative card game. In it you play a member of the crew of the ISS Shoemaker on the first crewed interstellar voyage in human history. Something has gone terribly wrong, and your jump engine has thrown the ship wildly off-course. Now you and your crew must work together to survive the many dangers of space and find your way back to Earth, our home.<br/><br/>In VOID, you are the crew of a starship with six systems. Each system has a resource you must manage; replenish the resource to keep the system functional or deplete it to use the system's ability. If ever a system is depleted with no resources left, it goes into failure and causes lasting problems until repaired (on top of losing access to it's system ability). Perhaps the most important system is the Engines, whose system ability allows the ship to jump one step closer to home.<br/><br/>Complicating the crew's mission are Event cards, one of which is drawn every turn. Sometimes, Events are neutral or even positive, but oftentimes they present the players with new challenges, as they deplete systems, cause damage to crew or even risk chain reactions. A Special kind of Event called a Mission Card is drawn each time the crew Jumps. There are nine Mission Cards in all in a given mission (chosen randomly from fifteen for variety) and once the crew has resolved the last of the nine, the Mission is successful. If the crew runs out of event cards or all systems go into failure, then the Mission has failed.<br/><br/>All the art and rules text of VOID are released under a creative commons license (CC By SA 4.0 to be exact).<br/><br/>&mdash;description from the publisher<br/><br/>",

        "description": "Operation Rolling Thunder is a simulation game that recreates the historical bombing campaign conducted by the US Air Force and the US Navy over North Vietnam during the period spanning from 1965 to 1968. The game accommodates both solitaire and cooperative play (in which one player assumes command of the US Air Force, while the other oversees operations of the Navy (with an option to play in semi-competitive mode)).<br/><br/>The core objective for the player(s) is to inflict enough infrastructural damage to compel North Vietnam to engage in peace negotiations while disrupting the flow of troops and resources that sustain the insurgency in South Vietnam via the logistics network known as the Ho Chi Minh Trail.<br/><br/>The overarching campaign is divided into seasonal phases, wherein the player or players determine which objectives have been identified as potential targets for the current phase. They then calibrate the scope and composition of air raids, aligning missions with their chosen strategic imperatives. Decisions entail prioritizing missions, including tasks like safeguarding raids against enemy fighter interception through combat air patrols, neutralizing enemy ground-based air defenses, deploying strike capabilities to maximize damage on specified targets, and the hunting down of opportunity targets. Through the use of cards, players resort to a repertoire of historical tactics, specialized missions, selective target assignments, and technological assets to optimize raid efficiency and protection. The augmentation of US forces occurs incrementally, encompassing both numerical reinforcements and advancements in equipment. This includes the introduction of advanced-technology missiles, reflecting an evolving military landscape. Additionally, pilots progressively gain experience, achieving exceptional proficiency in specific mission types.<br/>Targets of interest encompass oil and supply depots, military installations, industrial facilities, the railroad network, crucial bridges, and pivotal airfields, whose destruction bears varying consequences for North Vietnam's ability to generate supplies, mobilize forces, transport equipment, and defend its airspace. Consequently, players may experiment with different approaches, all the while remaining mindful of the alignment of their decisions with the underlying strategy implied by the Joint Chiefs of Staff target list. Higher-priority targets are invariably more robustly defended, necessitating a close monitoring of incurred losses; unacceptable levels can severely compromise or even prematurely shut down the campaign.<br/>After recording the damage (on the game map) inflicted by US air raids on North Vietnam's war-making capacity, the player or players retain the option to dispatch armed reconnaissance missions, scouting for opportunity targets en route to the South, and may call upon the formidable B-52s from the Strategic Air Command to administer targeted strikes on the mountain passes leading to the Ho Chi Minh Trail and on the trail itself.<br/><br/>In tandem with the military dimension, the game incorporates a 'political layer.' Herein, players contend with the constraints imposed by fluctuating directives emanating from the White House, driven by apprehensions of potential escalation involving China and the Soviet Union. These directives can manifest as stricter rules of engagement, prohibited targets, or specific mandates. In response, players challenge the political echelons for operational freedom, judiciously selecting the campaign aspects where enhanced flexibility is warranted.<br/><br/>The player or players face a difficult challenge reminiscent of the historical endeavor, which fell short of achieving its primary objectives. Despite the severe humanitarian toll inflicted by the campaign, it failed to fracture the resolve of the North Vietnamese people and its leadership, who exhibited exceptional resilience in the face of sustained aerial bombardment. The Vietnam War persisted for several more years, culminating in the well-documented denouement.<br/><br/>&mdash;description from the publisher<br/><br/>",

The Sun moves very closely to how we experience the sun moving in our world.<br/>     You will understand how the sun cycles signal the seasons of the year to the ancients.

It is up to the player to decide what kind of win they want.  <br/><br/><br/>Actual Mechanics, Earth Board:<br/><br/>The Sun is moved every month (all players take their turn) and the Festival Card the Sun is pointing at is played.

        "description": "A limited edition release, Big Bash Smash was the official tabletop game of the Big Bash Cricket Series and claims to be the &quot;best of cricket games smashed up and delivered in a quick, sharp and explosive tabletop game for the whole family&quot;.<br/><br/>Big Bash Smash offers three different game mode. Play a traditional match in Twenty20, be the first to 50 runs in the 50 Run Challenge, or see who can score the most runs in one over in a Super Over game!<br/><br/>Fans can also download a free scoreboard companion app, keep score with a digital scoreboard and capture the action with a slow-motion replay, just like the real thing.<br/><br/>This game borrows very heavily from the layout and style of the traditional and original TEST Match game, but with a few major differences. The mat is round and very colourful, with sponsors names printed on it and the 'fences' are simple freestanding cardboard, which do not surround the field. The mechanics of the bowler are also quite different in that the ball is ejected from the front of the stand by a spring lever, rather than being 'bowled' by the figure itself.<br/><br/>",

Whenever you move your figures, you move them in a straight line until terrain stops you or you decide to stop. Whenever you're moving inside line of sight of an opponent, they may try to interrupt you and take an action. Combat is resolved by drawing cards with defense icons, and damage is marked by figures themselves (by making them prone or removing them from the board).<br/><br/>All you need to start playing is 12 cards per player, 12 beads or tokens (to mark command points), handful of miniatures and some terrain, all of which can be downloaded and printed out before shelling out money.<br/><br/>&mdash;description from the publisher<br/><br/>",

These warriors start the game asleep, and before they can enter the battle they must be awakened by a specific role of the dice. Thereafter, they move and capture opposing pieces by ending their turn on an occupied space. The path can be blocked by opposing pieces, sending them back to their starting row.

The age of the game is unknown, except that it&rsquo;s been a tradition in the region for many generations. The game board is interesting in the lack of corner spaces, and the odd number of rows in most examples. The pieces start the game as expected, on the near rows of spaces. It&rsquo;s basically played like orthogonal Checkers, like other Middle Eastern jump-and-capture games. The difference appears when a piece reaches the far row and is promoted to a Tobit. Tobits can move like chess rooks and make long jumps to capture. Once they leave that back row, however, they lose their Tobit status. It&rsquo;s a very fun game for all ages, right alongside Checkers.<br/><br/>&mdash;description from the publisher<br/><br/>",

His companions are his young squire, the astute Crispin, his strong friend, the robust Goliath, and the Viking princess Sigrid.<br/><br/>The premise of the game is that Sigrid has been captured by a gang of Orcs and is now held in a Dungeon. The players have to travel along a game track through desert, jungle and into the Dungeon. The first player to reach Sigrid sets her free and wins the game.<br/><br/>At the beginning the players get a set of 'assistance cards'. The game track has fields with obstacles which you can pass by a die roll or by discarding a card. Other fields can give you new cards.<br/><br/>An unusual twist is that many of the hazards, such as orcs, snakes or skeletons, are represented by counters. Each player controls a set of these that he can move to harass the other players.<br/><br/>",

For example, the Deluge in the Polish-Lithuanian Commonwealth, the Troubles in the Russian Kingdom, the Thirty Years' War in Germany.Also, each move gives certain advantages to both one side and weakening the other.The game is very balanced. The author tried to convey this historical period as accurately as possible. The game requires 4-5 players.But in the future the author is thinking of adding more scenarios. Many events reflect the state of a particular state in a given period of time. Winning battles can provide benefits, but the player must not forget about diplomacy. If you are not protected by your allies, then any war you have will be doomed.<br/><br/>",

        "description": "Combining on-the-spot strategic decisions, along with exciting press-your-luck, competitive gameplay, Tee Masters gives golfers and non-golfers alike a set of engaging, continually evolving challenges, combined with fast-action gameplay that makes players call for &ldquo;one more round!&rdquo; as soon as the game ends. Just grab the Tee Masters custom dice, tee up on its 18 killer holes, and find out which friends and family rule the course!<br/><br/>Scoring mechanic of Tee Masters is simple to understand, but not necessarily easy: just match three of the Scoring Dice you&rsquo;re rolling on a hole, and you get that score on the hole. And you&rsquo;ve got three &ldquo;Group Rolls&rdquo; with all the dice, you set aside rolls you like as you move through those rolls, and you build up your best score for the hole.  In short: three tries to nail the lowest score possible for the hole.<br/><br/>But in Tee Masters, the Scoring Dice don&rsquo;t just have pars, birdies and eagles. Unfortunately, they also feature more damaging scores like +1 bogeys, +2 double bogeys, and even the dreaded +3 triple bogey.<br/><br/>And then there&rsquo;s the Shot Die, and that adds hole hazards like sand traps, wind, and water, and the dreaded DUFF, which can derail a great score in an instant. But the Shot Die also delivers &ldquo;Great Shots,&rdquo; which can help you improve your score on a hole, big time.<br/><br/>And in addition to its super-charged multiplayer gameplay, Tee Masters also plays great for one player. Because gameplay is so fast and straightforward, you&rsquo;ll find yourself hitting the Tee Masters course when you&rsquo;ve got ten or so minutes of spare time, just to see if you can achieve a new personal-best score.<br/><br/>Go for eagle, or play it safe? Avoid hazards, don&rsquo;t duff, and navigate each hole like a boss. Tee Masters is a fantastic challenge for golfers and non-golfers alike. At home, at game night, with fellow golfers at the clubhouse, or on vacation, Tee Masters is a great time for 1-4 players, or even teams.<br/><br/>&mdash;description from the designer<br/><br/>",

The House, given its strong bond with nature and the unknown, boasts powerful mystical powers and the ability to pass through roads and paths unknown to most. This House has its own initial Region, which is added on the main board as an expansion tile to the original game board. This also raises the player level count to 6.<br/><br/>The Explorations:<br/><br/>Inside the package you will find 18 exploration tokens, each depicting one or more different icons.  These represent the mysteries and discoveries that the Houses make as they wander through Candelabria, when they decide not to plunder the territory but to see what is in front of them.<br/><br/>During the Set-Up these tokens are to be placed face down, randomly, on each territory belonging to a region that is not identified as the initial Region of a House (whether or not this is present in the game).<br/><br/>When a model (Candle or Castle) of a House enters a territory containing a token, he can INSTEAD of deploying a Land Flame and then perform the action relating to the territory, take the Exploration token, placing it face down next to his House Board.  He may then reveal one of his exploration tokens as part of any action he takes to obtain the benefits indicated on this, or keep it covered to gain 1 VP at the end of each Year for each face-down token in his possession.<br/><br/>",

        "description": "With this expansion the single-player mode is introduced, that is the possibility for a player to unleash the power of the houses in six scenarios of increasing difficulty. Taking on the role of a different house each time, the player will have to confront increasingly stronger and more ruthless enemies to achieve the ultimate victory.<br/><br/>Each scenario has a predefined set-up, where the initial forces of the house are extremely small and are confronted against one or two other houses, scattered throughout the lands of Candelabria. The player, with a limited number of moves, will have to defeat all the forces present on the game board positioned around his goal or, alternatively, defeat all the Candles of the houses present on the board to triumph.<br/><br/>Although it follows the basic rules of the game, this mode has some exceptions, such as:<br/><br/>The Solo-Mode uses the 1-3 player side of the Game Board;<br/> The game does not end in 3 Years: the Years progresses as the player deploys and maneuvers, with different rules depending on the scenario and the difficulty. Each scenario can affect: the starting Year, how many moves are needed for the Year to progress, the maximum Year a player can reach;<br/> Opposing Houses can have more than 1 Land Flame per Territory: the enemy Houses can field more than one Land Flame per territory. It could happen in many ways (sometimes from the very beginning, depending on the scenario);<br/> Tactic Cards are discarded once used: each Tactic Card is discarded after a single use, and can not be acquired again. The symbols regarding the increase in initiative are translated into reading the battlefield better (see next area);<br/> 90 unique cards are introduced, to guide the actions of the enemies both in and out of combat. Each scenario will state when the out-of-combat actions of the enemies are taken, and from where the cards are resolved, while in combat the same cards act as a double tactic card that will try to harm the player depending on the theme of the card and the effect resolved;<br/> Some unique rules will be added to every scenario, like different winning and losing conditions depending on the narrative and the events that are taking place.<br/><br/>New Mechanics: Mountains<br/><br/>Within the expansion we introduce a new game mechanic: the mountains. This mechanic provides three-dimensionality to the game plan, expanding the strategic possibilities and limiting the movements of the opponents, creating a completely different map placing tiles.<br/><br/>Mountains are high ground, impassable by normal methods, which separate the territories they are placed between by breaking regions in half, or by separating two regions completely. These separations are to be positioned where indicated.<br/><br/>While small divisions might seem little, they&rsquo;re the key to hinder the development of an enemy force, create choke points and manipulate the map a little more, gaining the full value from movement and bringing out the strength of explorers.<br/><br/>",

This package and the mechanics contained are usable in every player count, with different twists and applications.<br/><br/>First, the Missions. While the King&rsquo;s gone, every House has many nobles and factions that wants to sit on the throne. This groups sent private letters and requests to the Houses, searching for an help in exchange for their support. Other make their trouble known to all the Houses, in hope that someone comes and help them out.<br/><br/>Mission cards are cards with a specific request on them, be it to kill a candle, build a temple or control a specific region. By completing the request, the players can receive Victory Points to help them gain some edge in the war for the throne of Candelabria.<br/><br/>Every player will receive two Mission Cards at the beginning of a game, during Set-Up. One of the two cards is taken by the player in the form of a private mission, a secret objective that he needs to accomplish, while the other card is placed near the board and create a set of mission that all the players can access to. As a side note, two types of missions are available:<br/><br/>Yearly missions, which can be completed once a year.<br/>Ranking missions, where the reward can be taken by the first three players.<br/>While the personal mission will award points only to the player that possess the mission, the common ones will be claimed through one of this methods. The idea behind this is to create a pool of changing milestones and objectives for the players to interact with, giving other ways to gather Victory Points and have fun while strategizing around that. This will help giving substance to the Turn Order too, since now the advantage for the first player would not only be to win draws but also the be able to complete an objective first, and thus giving some weight to the combat choices of getting initiative.<br/><br/>Second, the Decay. The ones closer to the power are the ones that first melt. Since the Houses tried to subdue the Curse with sacrifice, Decay has spread into their ranks, changing their values and slowly chipping at them.<br/><br/>Decay cards are cards with specific effects, similar to tactics cards. Their usage, although, is different. Decay cards are received every time a player try to win influence over a Course but fails, during the combat phase. These cards are placed on the War Board and modify the effect on that until the current War Season is over, giving a new tactical asset and effects to the Houses.<br/><br/>Decay is a mechanic with the intent to lessen the burden for a failed bet or wrong move on the Curse, by giving not an advantage but the chance to play around new effects and get a well-deserved revenge (with enough strategy and intelligence).<br/><br/>",

The gameplay has various twists. The team that actually wins the race does not score. Instead, the team in 2nd place determines the points distribution.<br/><br/>As teams move along the course, they can get a boost by passing through boats ahead of them. With several boats, this can create large moves. But if a leading group catches up with a lagging group, instead of being lapped, the lagging group simply joins the leaders. So falling behind is not necessarily bad if you can get the leader to catch you up.<br/><br/>The game is played over two races, and the final winner is determined from several factors: the rankings from each race, your predictions during the races, the cards remaining in your hand, points from your colours. The final total gives the eventual winner.<br/><br/>ENG rules are available online.<br/>user summary<br/><br/>1チーム4隻のヨットで行うレースゲームです<br/>カードプレイによるレースゲームですが、「次の空きマスまでヨットは進む」「先頭集団の先頭のヨットが先頭になる（周回遅れのヨット群に追いつくとそこが先頭に吸収される）」<br/>「全員がカードを使い切るまでレースは続く」といった特徴があります。<br/>また、「各チーム2番目のヨットで順位が決まる」「各チーム1番目のヨットはレースから抜ける」ことでレースは少し混沌となります。<br/>前後半2回のラウンドを通じてより多くの点数を獲得すると思うチームに投票し、最終的に投票に使用したチケットの点数が最も多い人が勝者となります。<br/>publisher summary<br/><br/>",

        "description": "サイクリアン (Cyclian) is a quick network building game from Japan. Players use just 12 of the 24 tiles in the game, meaning a 3P game each player plays 4 turns, a 4P game they only have 3 turns.<br/><br/>Whilst the graphic design is very abstract, the game is explicitly about operating a rail network. Players start from their own colour stations as connectors, and build and manipulate routes. The tiles show lines and curves, with 2 lines on each side, in one or two colours on each tile. There are stations which show two rail companies crossing.<br/><br/>The goal is to build the longest section on the board that connects two of your stations. But the track does not have to be all your own colour. In the manner of the private rail companies in Japan, trains run on other people's tracks. So the objective is to get the longest run of your colour from into the whole board and out of the board somewhere else, by which two of your stations connect, thus controlling that line. A section scores 1 point for each tile, and also 1 point for each opponent's station on the section.<br/><br/>However, on their turn, a player can turn a placed tile 90 degrees before placing their own tile from their hand. This is not rotating the tile in place. Instead, it spins 90 degrees on one corner, so moving the tile (and possibly connecting tiles) to an adjacent space. In this way, a player's high scoring section can be broken up.<br/><br/>When all the tiles are played, the player controlling the highest scoring section is the winner.<br/><br/>The designer says this is the first game in a 'Minimalian' series, the next being Serealian.<br/>user summary<br/><br/>",

        "description": "In this turn-based push-your-luck strategy game for 1-5 players you take the role of a Wildlife Photographer, visiting the Kashmir Valley in an attempt to photograph and publish photos of the critically endangered Hangul. Set in 1970, you are using colour film to take photos, and the game begins when you are down to your last 20 exposures. So, what will you do? Track down the elusive Hangul, or settle for other wildlife? What publishing deals will you manage to obtain&mdash;and what photos do they require? Push yourself too hard, and you may end up scaring the wildlife or worse &mdash; wasting precious film!<br/><br/>Focus! Last Roll for the Hangul deploys multiple mechanism to recreate the thrilling challenge of wildlife photography: the unpredictability of the animals is reflected by dice, while the challenge of getting published is represented by cards that specify which animals to photograph for the publication. A modular board is used to speed up the process of updating the position of all the fast moving animals on the table.<br/><br/>On on your turn you spend Action Tokens to execute actions like moving to a new area, adding more Animal Tokens to the board, negotiating Contracts before they are gone, and taking photos. When an animal is successfully photographed, the targeted Animal Token is collected from the board. To take the photo however, you must be in the same area as the animal, which means there is a constant pressure to move around the board. You will additionally have to balance the need for a sharp photo with the need to conserve film. And all of this, is wrapped in a push-your-luck mechanic that allows you to repeat any successful action by increasing the chance of failure.<br/><br/>A new round will not start if two of multiple game ending conditions arise, allowing you to tactically end the game when it secures your victory. You win the game by having the most victory points, which are earned by the photos you take &mdash; and doubled by getting them published.<br/><br/>&mdash;description from the designer<br/><br/>",

Over the years, you have developed quite a network of informants and tipsters, and today, one of those has dropped a story into your lap about another black-hearted soul who has been mentioned in the news lately. According to the tipster, someone anonymously dropped off a roll of film. While it was being developed, the photo tech noticed that some of the images on the roll showed the grisly scene of what appeared to be a murder. This is the third in a string of recent killings. In each instance, the details of the murder have been revealed by a roll of film that has been dropped off at a different photo center. Police are at a loss on how to track down the killer the media has dubbed &ldquo;The Darkroom Devil.&rdquo; Thankfully, another of your informants works inside the police department and has given you access to everything they have on this killer.

After the zoo closed on Thursday, staff members were busy at work cleaning habitats, caring for the animals, and adding the finishing touches to a new exhibit entitled, &ldquo;Endangered Species.&rdquo; Little did they know that the most endangered species that evening was man. Claude, the adult male lion of the Hampstead Zoo, escaped his exhibit and killed head zoo keeper Daniel Strickland in an uncharacteristic display of savagery. Claude was immediately tranquilized and caged pending further inquiry into the incident, but there are many suspicious details about this incident that warrant investigation. The Chief Director of the Hampstead Zoo doesn&rsquo;t think this was a mere accident and has hired the Will Street Detective Agency to solve this mystery.  Explore this wild kingdom and determine if Strickland&rsquo;s death was the result of human orchestration or the byproduct of trying to tame Mother Nature.

        "description": "The Sea of ​​Mists is capricious and changeable. In this world, even islands can change their location, and enemy ships can appear at any time. Each player will command their own fleet of powerful airships, and by fighting and expanding your economic supply, you will try to gain more victory points than your opponents or destroy three enemy harbors. There are several paths to victory, but only one commander will become the lord of Nebelmeer!<br/><br/>Nebelmeer is a strategy game of battling airships in a fantasy steampunk world of floating islands. The gameplay is divided into turns, which individual players take until the winner is determined. As the game progresses, players unlock subsequent acts (maximum 4), which give them access to new buildings and better airships. The game ends in one of three cases:<br/><br/><br/>     The last act IV victory point token is collected - the player who has collected the most points wins (the tokens have different values, from 2 to 4).<br/>     One player destroys 3 enemy harbors - this player automatically wins the game.<br/>     One player is eliminated (there are no harbors or airships). In a 2-player game, the opponent immediately wins. In a game with 3 or 4 players, the game ends immediately and the player with the most victory points wins. In a 2 vs 2 game, the team with the highest total victory points wins.<br/><br/><br/>&mdash;description from the publisher<br/><br/>",

Don the cloak of a random crafty character, each with their own unique special ability that can be used at pivotal moments to outlast your adversaries. The villain with a thirst for power and destruction, commands an army of loyal minions, determined to take down all rival animals. Rivals on the other paw are fighting for glory, battling to deal the final blow that defeats the villain and become champion of the city. However if no villain is in play, it becomes a classic battle royale, last character standing.<br/><br/>Strategically wield an array of action cards to outmanoeuvre your opponents, use them to your advantage to boost your defences or enhance your attack but beware of traps hidden within the deck. Traps create an added element of danger, they will deal instant damage to disrupt your carefully crafted plans and are especially dangerous end game.<br/><br/>With every successful attack, characters collect skull tokens to track damage taken until they inevitably fall. When critical with only one health point remaining, a player must reveal their character by flipping it face up on the field and that's how you discover who is in play. Revealed characters are now at your most vulnerable but also at their strongest. Special ability can be used once at any time per reveal to help claw back to the top.<br/><br/>The path to victory lies within the paws of the craftiest Frayed Ally.<br/><br/>&mdash;description from the designer<br/><br/>",

        "description": "リーサルチェックメイト (Lethal Check Mate) is a Chess-style game from Japan that uses cards to move and attack. The game board is only 3x4 and each player has only a single pawn on the board. It is the specialised cards that let a player either move or attack with their pawn.<br/><br/>Played cards build up, so a player might play a Centaur card to attack the column ahead, and then play a Rook card to move a pawn sideways, which now combines with the attack to do damage to the opponent. Each attack does one damage to the opponent, and players start with 3 Hit Points (HP). Each loss also increases the player's hand size, from 3 cards to 4 to 5 cards. The first to zero is the loser.<br/><br/>However, a player can opt to lose a hit point in order to deal as much damage as their hand allows. Hence the game being lethal. A player can even be on 1 HP and still do a lethal attack to win.<br/><br/>The board also rotates. When a player advances a piece to the opponent's back row, the board turns 180 degrees. The cards remain in play, so by the board changing position, the opponent's attack might suddenly be useless, or the player's pawn might now have a valid attack.<br/><br/>The game comes with the 3x4 chequer board, 4 pawns (one to play and one to score for each player), and a deck of 11 cards each, one for scoring your HP, one player aid listing the card powers, and nine cards to play.<br/>user summary<br/><br/>",

The numbers from 1-16 in the area are arranged in such a way that 4 specific spaces result in the number 34. One can form the number 34 in over 70 different ways. The players take turns placing a figure in a number space with the aim of reaching 34 with 4 figures as quickly as possible and preventing each other from doing so by cleverly placing them in between. Once a player has reached 34, he calls out &ldquo;is&rdquo; and robs his opponent of a piece of his own choice, just not from a closed &ldquo;is&rdquo;. The winner is whoever robs the opponent of all but 3 figures. 2 or 4 people can play this way, on 2 areas each. If there are 6 or 8 participants, two players each play against each other, but only on one area with 6 pieces of one color each. Here, for an &ldquo;Is&rdquo; no figure is stolen, but 1 point is added; The number of points to be achieved is determined in advance.<br/><br/>2nd game:<br/>In each area, 2 people can play with 5 figures of one color each. Whoever rolls one puts his figure on space one, rolls the dice again and advances the figure by the number he rolls. The path crisscrosses the 16 spaces. If a player rolls onto an occupied field, the throw is invalid, but if he already has several figures in play, he can carry out this forward movement with another one, as long as the space reached is free. The path goes over the 16 spaces to the 8 white spaces , always starting with the smallest space. From there it goes through the 5 spaces in the pyramid into the SOS-space, where only the O is occupied. But the O must be touched with every figure. From here go straight to the middle via the 31st, 32nd, 33rd and 34th to the 35th red space. Whoever has reached this space places his figure in one of the 5 yellow spaces. The first player to get his 5 figures on the 5 yellow spaces wins the game. One may also play around the whole game board.<br/><br/>",

An angry queen accuses Alice of stealing her tarts, but Alice escapes with a new friend, the Black Knight. Join Alice and the Black Knight on their adventures!<br/><br/>赤いアリスと黒の騎士 (&quot;Red Alice and the Black Knight&quot;) includes 32 cards, 14 black and 18 red. The cards are numbered, but OR cards offer a choice of numbers. This anthology includes rules for three games, each one being the designer's take on combining other popular games. Certain cards also have special effects that change from game to game.<br/><br/>Party (Daifugō (Tycoon) x Dabon, 2-6 players) is a climbing and shedding game with goal of getting rid of all your cards. Players must play an equal or higher number unless someone plays multiple matching cards; then players must play equal or lower numbers. If the deck runs out, the player with the most cards chooses one to keep and contributes the rest of their cards to become the new draw deck. There are also optional rules, including the ability to play all of your cards at once if you can add, subtract, multiply, or divide all the cards in your hand to equal the last card played.<br/><br/>In Tart (Cockroach Poker x Love Letter, 2-4 players), players attempt to guess other player's face-down cards while keeping their own secret. Players begin with three face-down cards. Each turn they play a card from their hand face-up. If they play a red card, they may guess one of another player's face-down cards. There are optional rules where different cards have special effects.<br/><br/>Checkmate (Chess x Rock Paper Scissors, 2 players) uses only 14 cards. Players place 5 cards from their hand face-down in front of themselves and will flip one face-up each turn. If the colors match, the higher number wins. If the colors don't match, the lower number wins. Players continue until one has won the best of five games.<br/><br/>",

Also included are suggestions for how to use this deck with 6 traditional card games: Spades, Hearts, Rummy, Gin Rummy, Crazy Eights, and President.

They're all experts in certain subjects, but at this rate they're a perfect storm for failing grades and will have to repeat a year. How did they pass their entrance exams in the first place? A three-year battle between teachers and students begins now!<br/><br/>In 卒業promenade (&quot;Graduation Promenade&quot;), players take on the roles of teachers trying to help five students pass their class. Each round or school year made up of three turns or semesters. At the end of each round, teachers gains victory points for every student who passes the Final Exam. If students fail to pass, the teacher receives a penalty.<br/><br/>The play area includes a Class for each player and a Schedule, made up of rows and columns of School Cards that match the colors of different students. On each turn, players take all the cards from their choice of row or column and place them under students of the same color. Depending on turn order, players may switch out cards from their hand with cards in the Schedule. If all the cards taken by a player share the same color, the player may take a Motivator (a token that counts toward the Final Exam) or a Break Card (plays like a School Card but some have special actions). Players end their turn by selecting their place in the turn order for the next round.<br/><br/>At the end of every third turn, players count up the points under each student to see if the pass the Final Exam, and points and penalties are given out. At the end of the third round, the player with the most victory points wins and gets to choose one used Break Card for each student. Someone reads the corresponding ending for the students, which changes depending on which Break Card is chosen for them.<br/><br/>This game is a remake of 業method (&quot;Graduation Method&quot;), a Manifest Destiny game from 2013.<br/><br/>",

Players need to determine all three secret mysteries to win.<br/><br/>Players draw cards and ask questions to narrow down the information they need to recover their bag.<br/><br/>Lasercut Components:<br/>&bull; 16x16 game board<br/>&bull; 40 airport code tiles<br/>&bull; 40 unlock code tiles<br/>&bull; 154 secret item cards<br/>&bull; 54 attribute cards<br/>&bull; 4 secrets holders<br/>&bull; 20 question tiles<br/>&bull; 40 possibility markers<br/>&bull; 4 dry erase boards<br/>&bull; 4 dry erase markers<br/>&bull; 12 coins valued 1-3 points.<br/><br/>Initial Setup:<br/>Assemble the game board.<br/>Give each player a secrets holder, dry erase board, dry erase marker, 10 question tiles and 10 possibility markers.<br/>Shuffle the attribute cards and place face down in a draw pile.<br/>Place the coins face up, nearby.<br/><br/>Basic Round Preparation:<br/>Shuffle the three sets of secret tiles.<br/>Carefully slide one number tile, one airport code tile and one item tile face down to each player.<br/>Each player places their secrets holder over the three tiles and flips the holder over such that tiles are facing outwards.<br/>Each player will now see the holders of the other players but not the contents of their holder.<br/><br/>Game Play:<br/>Players take turns to either<br/>Flip over an attribute card or<br/>Ask a question or<br/>Attempt a guess.<br/><br/>Flipping an Attribute Card:<br/>When the card is revealed, all players report what is shown on other players secrets holders. Here are some  examples:<br/>If the attribute is &ldquo;METALLIC&rdquo; and a player&rsquo;s holder has the &ldquo;TRUMPET&rdquo;, then tell that player they have lost a metallic item. <br/>If the attribute is &ldquo;Airport on ISLAND&rdquo;, and a player&rsquo;s secret holder has &ldquo;Trinidad&rdquo;, tell that player their location is on an island.<br/>If the attribute is &ldquo;CITY A-F&rdquo;, and a player&rsquo;s secret holder has &ldquo;ORD - Chicago&rdquo;, tell that player their city starts with a letter between A and F.<br/>Asking a Question:<br/>A player may ask a general question about one of their secrets.<br/><br/>Asking a Question:<br/>A player may ask a general question about one of their secrets. This includes narrowing down the locker number and non-specific questions like &ldquo;Can I hold my item?&rdquo; or &ldquo;Would my item cost less than $20?&rdquo;.  If you think you know what your item or location is, attempt a guess instead.<br/><br/>Marking Possibilities:<br/>Place your possibility markers on items, locations and numbers you think match the answers to questions. For example, if someone tells you&rsquo;re your item is green, place the markers on the green items. When you find out your item is round, remove the markers from items that are not round. Use a process of elimination to narrow down your secrets.<br/><br/>Attempting a Guess:<br/>A player may attempt to guess one of their secrets by using one of their question tiles. The tile is placed on either the airport code, locker number or item. If the guess is correct, they, highlight it on your dry erase board. Otherwise, discard the question tile as it cannot be reused in this round.<br/><br/>A player who guesses all three secrets will get the next highest value coin. Up to three players can receive coins per round. For example, the first player to guess correctly will receive the coin with the value &quot;3&quot;.<br/><br/>Winning the Game:<br/>The player who has the most coin values at the end of three rounds is the winner. In case of a tie, the youngest player wins.<br/><br/>Attribute Cards:<br/>When an attribute card is revealed, all players must inform each other when they see someone&rsquo;s secret tiles matching that attribute.<br/>Specific Attribute    Missing item can be described with this attribute    See cheat sheet.<br/>Airport in &hellip;    Airport is in this country or continent    See cheat sheet<br/>Airport Code Two Vowels    Airport codes with two vowels    Examples: OOM, ACE, ODE, EAR<br/>Airport on Island    Three airports:    POS, ORK, ARE<br/>Airport Code Contains A,E,O        Examples: SEA, OLD, ART, ALL, ILE<br/>Airport Code Letters 1st &lt; Last    The first letter of the airport code is alphabetically less than the last letter.    Examples: EAS, <br/>COO, POS, ANK.<br/>Not: UNK, ODE.<br/>City a-z    The first letter of the city for the airport is in the specified range.    Examples for <br/>CITY G-L:<br/>Gold Coast (OOL)<br/>Kileem (ILE)<br/>Will Adding x Make a 4-letter word?    When the specified letter is adding to the beginning or end of the airport code, will a four-letter word be formed?    Examples for adding the letter &ldquo;S&rdquo;:<br/>S+EAT = SEAT<br/>BEE+S = BEES<br/><br/>",

Each player will allocate 2 of the 3 dice to an Action which they will perform, then the remaining die will be allocated to the Single Die Track. Play another round unless your game has ended which happens when you allocate the 6th die of the same number to the Single Die Track.<br/><br/>Highest score wins!

        "description": "Factory 42 is a bustling hub of Dwarven innovation, where diligent Odrixian laborers work hard for the betterment of society. The Overseer frequently shouts, &quot;More materials are needed for today's orders,&rdquo; shouts the Overseer, with monotonous regularity &ldquo;We need to improve! The Motherland needs our best!&quot; This prompts a worker, Isabella, to rush to the office under the watchful eye of the Commissar to fill out an acquisition order.<br/><br/>As she starts to write, she happens to glance at the top of the page and sees the workers who will have to fulfill this order. It&rsquo;s the workers at Mine 77. Isabella chuckles at the thought of them struggling with this demand, remembering her former experiences working in the mine. She recalls the vast complex of underground fields, caves, and caverns drilled through the city's bowels and the long weary days spent toiling there. In Mine 77, workers work four days in two shifts, with only a brief on-site rest to break the tedium. <br/>Fortunately, she is now too old to be sent back to the mine.<br/>Age has its perks.<br/><br/>Mine 77 is a prequel game to Factory 42 that simulates the inner workings of Odrixia's largest mine. It is here that the valuable resources are gathered for the Factory. As you play the game, you will experience the hard work, cunning, and outright shenanigans required to become a successful Overseer at Mine 77.<br/><br/>Up to five players compete to become the most productive Overseer, manipulating their workers and tasks to achieve a profitable balance of hard work, difficult administration, and copious quantities of beer. The game comes with two solo AI variants. The AI may also be used as an additional worker in 2p game.<br/><br/>Mine 77 uses a dual-rondel mechanic and simultaneous action selection, spiced with some deck-building elements. And there are two different NPCs to offer an opponent to battle against when no human opponents are available.<br/><br/>",

        "description": "Natal Seas is an ocean themed, dynamic-territorial game played on the cells ('waters') of a hexagonal grid in the shape of the Pacific Ocean. Each piece abstractly represents a pod of Orcas or Humpback whales.'<br/> The goal is to add and move your pods until the other player's pods are permanently excluded from over half the waters of the board.<br/><br/>To start, one player places <br/><br/>     2 Orcas pods anywhere on the board, and <br/>     1 grey Humpback pod next to one of them. <br/><br/><br/>Then the other player chooses which kind of pods to play.<br/><br/>Humpbacks begin the regular alternating turns.<br/><br/>Each turn has:<br/><br/>     A. two required 'birthing' actions (placements), and <br/>     B. a maximum of one 'migration' action (optional movement)<br/><br/><br/>The migration may be taken at anytime during the turn.<br/><br/>The 'Birthing' Action:<br/>consists of placing a new pod on 'water safe for birthing', that is an unoccupied water cell next to more friendly than unfriendly pods.<br/><br/>The 'Migration' Action:<br/><br/>     One pod begins migrating around another pod (of either type) by moving to a cell of open water that is next to them both. <br/>     The first pod may continue to skirt pods in this manner for as far as it likes. <br/><br/><br/>-- HOWEVER, The migrating pod may never:<br/>-- * move to or through water that is safe for unfriendly birthing; that is, it may not move to water that has more unfriendly than friendly pods around it. Be sure to count the migrating pod when comparing.<br/>-- * move away from all the neighboring pods, even if it would reach other pods by doing so.<br/><br/>Natal Seas:<br/>Areas that the unfriendly pods can no longer ever enter are called 'natal seas' because they are effectively reserved for the birthing of friendly whale pods.<br/><br/>Ending the game:<br/>When your pods, together with all your natal seas cover over half the board, you win. If you are the player that set up the first three pieces, you win when you cover exactly half the board, as well.<br/><br/>",

        "description": "&quot;We sink!&quot; shouts the elephant, &ldquo;That mouse is too heavy!&rdquo; &quot;Don't worry!&quot; whispers the lion, &quot;If I eat the giraffe, we can lose a little weight.&quot;<br/><br/>In All Aboard! you must get your gang of animals to safety in the different boats, but be careful not to exceed their capacity, or else they will sink. Designed by Paco Y&aacute;nez and illustrated by Monsuros, this fun card game can be played as a couple or in groups of up to 5 players, from 7 years old, in games lasting about 20 minutes.<br/><br/>Before starting, each player receives a set of 12 cards with the 12 different animals in the game (mouse, peacock, fox, octopus, monkey, sloth, elk, zebra, giraffe, lion, bear and elephant). The game is played over 4 rounds and each one consists of two phases: boarding the boats and setting sail. In the boarding phase, players will place one of the animals face up in any of the boats, taking into account that there can be no more than 3 animals in each one. In the second turn, they will place a new animal in any of the available boats, but this time face down; Finally, in the third turn a third animal will board the available boats, again face up.<br/><br/>At the beginning of the setting sail phase, all animal cards that have been played face down are revealed and then a check is made to see if there are two or more animals of the same species. If there are 2, they both fall in love (and the players will receive points for it). If there are 3, they fight and the boat sinks. Next, the animals activate their effects and finally the sum of the weight of the animals on board the boat is checked. If the weight of the animals is equal to or less than the weight that the boat can withstand, the animals manage to set sail and will score at the end of the game. Each player takes their animals and places them in a pile of saved animals in their playing area. If, on the other hand, the boat sinks, the animals are discarded.<br/><br/>Knowing when to play each animal is one of the keys to the game. However, depending on how your rivals play the cards, unforeseen situations can arise on the ships. Each animal has its own power, which can unleash chaos or balance the scales. Will you be able to save as many animals as possible?<br/><br/>-description from the publisher<br/><br/>",

        "description": "Set in the Blind Business universe, Fritos is a game for cooking lovers where the playing area is...a fryer! Players take control of various foods and try to survive at all costs, jumping from one side of the fryer basket to the other. When a player cannot move, they fall into the boiling oil, being fried, and (unfortunately) eliminated from the game. You must use all the cards you collect to survive and not become deliciously battered.<br/><br/>Fritos has three game modes: free-for-all, suitable for 2 to 6 players; the mode against the chef, a semi-co-operative version for groups of 3 to 7 players, in which one will be the chef and will try to fry the rest of the players; and team mode, in which two equal groups compete to win. Each game mode has a few different cards to tailor the experience.<br/><br/>After assembling the central board with nine cards, which represent spaces on the fryer grid, players begin their turns, which are divided into two phases: playing cards and moving. The first phase allows you to play as many cards as you want, with the aim of improving the position in the fryer or annoying and attacking your rivals. The second phase allows you to move 1-2 cards away. At that moment, the card you reached is revealed, then either an effect is triggered or you can claim that card to use it later.<br/><br/>&mdash;description from the publisher<br/><br/>",

The Penumbral Phoenix emerges as an adversary at the first level of the Kemet Hunt, while the formidable Hellfire Phoenix appears at level six.<br/><br/>Incorporating the Phoenix into your campaign will add an intriguing layer of novelty to the Kemet Hunt system. In the first level, the Penumbral Phoenix arrives as your opponent after the first enemy killed on a quest, entering the fray in a blaze of flames, wreaking havoc amongst nearby combatants. Should you progress to the daunting Kemet Hunt level 6, you will face the powerful Hellfire Phoenix bringing even greater challenge to your heroes.<br/><br/>These awe-inspiring mystical creatures, native to the Darkall continent, have been bound by Kemet's necromantic magic. They now roam the skies of Tanares, seeking out the energies of death and arriving in a spectacular fiery display.<br/><br/>The Phoenix undoubtedly enhances the Kemet Hunt system. Along with a refined Kemet Hunt we developed for all backers, those who pledge for the Phoenix will also have the option of using this stunning miniature and distinct villain, offering a unique new mechanic.<br/><br/>",

Since the failed zombie apocalypse of 2042, zombies have found gainful employment with CTZ Propulsion Labs. Each crash teaches us about impact and safety to ensure the greatest level of safety.&nbsp;<br/><br/>Crash Test Zombies is a revolutionary game, from Roll and Write Revolution, where players are using a pizza saver table to launch their die and hopefully land it on the target. The value of the die is recorded as this is what the zombie crashed into from roller skates to ice cream trucks to UFOs. Your opponents will also launch their own dice. Doing so may result in a change to your die which you will record at the beginning of your turn before launching again.&nbsp;<br/><br/>As you gain skill with each type of crash you will earn bonus effects such as relaunches.

Once they finad a place to build their Town Hall, they select a Governor to run the city and steadily create a beautiful 3D isometric city. Using resource gathering the player can continue to expand their population, generate income, unlock more advanced units and build up infrastructure to help achieve their objectives.<br/><br/>The player loses if their Town Hall is destroyed, if their Heroes suffer 3 casualties (collectively) or if an objective is not met.<br/><br/>The player wins if they defeat their opponents and/or meet the victory conditions laid out in the chosen game mode.<br/><br/>The game supports multiple game modes from solo build, solo campaign, coop single player, coop vs, and last player standing.<br/>-description from designer<br/><br/>",

        "description": "Step into the shoes of the sower in this fast-paced card game inspired by the Parable of the Sower from Matthew 13. Out-sow your opponent by making wise decisions about when and where you scatter seeds.<br/><br/>In the Sower, two players draw from shuffled identical decks, 'seed' cards 1 through 10 in yellow and black. Their goal is to play all ten black cards in order from 1 to 10 in the Good Soil area of the board. Playing cards into the other soil areas (The Path, Rocky Soil, Thorny Soil) will help players cycle through and reorder their draw decks and retrieve cards from the board.<br/><br/>You will start with three cards. On your turn, draw a card and play a card into one of the four soils. You will interact with each soil differently. Important to keep in mind is that The Path and Rocky Soil are areas shared by both players, while players keep their piles separate in Thorny Soil and Good Soil areas.<br/><br/>The interactions of each soil are as follows: Play a yellow card lower in number than any previously played into Rocky soil, then draw two cards and play any one from your hand into a different soil. Be careful, however, because once there are four cards in Rocky soil, they get moved to The Path and are out of the game. Play a black card into Thorny Soil to draw three cards from your deck and replace four cards either on the top or bottom of your deck in any order. Play any yellow card into The Path--those cards are gone for good--to draw a card and pick up a card from either the Rocky or Thorny Soil. Finally, play any number of black cards in order from 1 to 10 into the Good Soil to work toward winning the game.<br/><br/>The theming is this game is apparent in each of the four soils. Each soil's interaction is based on the Parable. Seeds that fall onto The Path are taken away by the birds. Seeds that fall on the Rocky Soil wither in the sun and blow away. Seeds that fall on the Thorny Soil are choked by the weeds. And the seeds that fall on the Good Soil flourish. The mechanics of the game are meant to reflect these ideas.<br/><br/>Players can expect to look for action combinations, dig through their deck as efficiently as possible, play tactically to to affect their opponent's choices--particularly in the Rocky Soil--and feel the mounting pressure as the bottom of the draw deck gets closer and closer.<br/><br/>-description from designer<br/><br/>",

        "description": "超超長城 (Super Hyper Great Wall) is a 2 player deck-building game with some novel ideas. Players are competing to build a Great Wall, such as a famous Great Wall in another land. The wall is the victory points, so simply extending the wall as much as possible is one path to success.<br/><br/>However, the game uses a wide variety of cards, and as well as extending the wall, it is also used to store cards for later use.<br/><br/>The cards have no purchase cost. Instead, the player uses the powers of one card to gain more cards, dependant on conditions. So a player might play an action card get another card, if their hand is not too large. So there is a usage cost, but not a purchase cost.<br/><br/>Also, the starting hand is already strong. Players begin with powerful cards and good choices, and do not have to spend several rounds building up the action. The game is quite serious right from the start (the designer rates it for age 12+), but also beginners do not have to be familiar with the game to play well. The designer says the dilemma is whether to increase your hand or the wall, not puzzling over spending money.<br/><br/>There are 30 different types of card in the game, including a lot of folklore characters and historic weapons. The artist (黒子洋瓦 Kuroko-tile) was overworked completing the game.<br/><br/>When the game ends, the player with the most points is the winner, drawn from the length of wall and the cards used to build the wall.<br/>user summary<br/><br/>",

This is a modification for the rules Brigade: Fire and Fury.  A copy of these rules is needed to play this game.<br/><br/>Why has a set of Civil War rules been adapted for space battles? Simply put, the battles in LotGH are EPIC. Fleets consist of thousands of vessels, from battleships to destroyers, and millions of soldiers. Because of technology it is no longer possible to use guided weaponry, so commanders are made to adapt formations and fight the battles using Napoleonic tactics. Ships line up and fire volleys, hoping to score a hit, they charge, outflank, and form various breakthrough and fire formations. The battles are fought over long distances, with weapons firing out as far as 40 light seconds. The commander of the fleet, like Napoleon, watches the battle and makes decisions, hoping that his strategy takes the day.<br/><br/>It was apparent that the battles of LotGH would need to be land based. Fire and Fury presented a groundwork that was easily adapted for fleets that have adopted horse and musket tactics. As such, there was no great need for modification of the rules; the only big difference being that the infantry, cavalry and artillery stands were now replaced with ships. The way the game plays has some minor changes, but all-in-all the game plays like a typical Fire and Fury battle.<br/><br/>The game is meant to be played with the 1/12000 scale model ships from Hobby Base and Alba Creates.  The scale is 1&quot; = 1 light year and 1 ship is around 500 vessels.  The 34-page booklet includes modified rules for playing the game under Brigade Fire and Fury, ship and leader data, organization tables, game charts, and counters of the ships that can be cut out and used as proxies.<br/><br/>You can get a copy of Fire and Fury at: <a target='_blank' href=\"https://www.fireandfury.com/\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer noopener\">https://www.fireandfury.com/</a><br/><br/>",

It is as simple as that.<br/><br/>Players attempt to score the most points using their Goal cards in the most effective way. Each player begins with 6 Goal cards in hand and throughout the game, must discard down to 2.<br/><br/>The Goal cards have discard abilities that may be used to affect the Icon cards in front of players. When a Goal card is discarded, the player may choose to activate the accompanying ability, but only twice in a round.<br/><br/>Icon cards are laid out in front of each player (7 for a 1-4 player game, and 5 for 5-6 players.) These cards are not allowed to be rearranged unless discard abilities are used. The final layout/composition of the Icon cards determines whether players are or aren't successful with the final 2 goals left in their hand.<br/><br/>At the end of each round, players add their cumulative scores across their 4 discarded Goal cards and their final 2 Goal cards to see who won the round. There are varied ways a game can be scored to determine an ultimate winner.<br/><br/>",

Players take turns peeking at hidden treasures, rearranging their nests, raiding the house and each other&rsquo;s nests, and cementing their treasures in place to make the neatest nest. The most organized player tableau wins the game. Play 1-3 games at 10-15 minutes per game. Or play against Roborat in solo mode. Turns and games are quick, so play a best-of-three tournament for more fun. The game can be expanded to 4 to 6 players with two decks.<br/><br/>In Picky Packrats, you are a packrat neatly arranging the treasures you have collected in your midden (nest). Add treasures by raiding the house or other packrat middens. You are very particular and want everything 'just so.' Unfortunately, like all packrats, you are very forgetful, so you need to remind yourself what treasures you have already packed away, while you try to arrange them in your midden to near perfection. When you really like where your treasures are hidden, you cement them in place. Once you or another packrat cements everything down, you compare middens. The pickiest packrat&mdash;the one with the neatest nest&mdash;wins!<br/><br/>&mdash;description from the designer<br/><br/>",

You will fight the elements and try to escape.<br/><br/>The game consists of rounds, each round you decide what to do based on the dice and the available resources. You should administer the changes on the game board, use cards from the exploration deck, activate other combinations, then subtract your resources consumed that day and start the next round. The game continues until the victory conditions are met; you successfully send an S.O.S. radio signal and receive an answer and also build the escape pod.

While it keeps the tried and tested game rules and mechanics the same, the layout has been redone to ensure smoother gameplay and make the game easier to learn.<br/><br/>Both players try to be the first to reach 66 points to win a hand. Points can be earned by winning tricks or by presenting certain card combinations. Players may also block the draw pile or make strategic use of their cards to impede their opponents' ability to score points.<br/><br/>At the beginning of the game, each player is dealt 5 cards, an additional card is revealed and placed face up under the pile of remaining cards. This suit now has the advantage, cards of this color will now win tricks against any other color. In all other cases, the card with the higher number wins the trick if it matches the suit of the card that started the trick.<br/><br/>Whoever did not deal the cards, starts. They may play a card to start a trick, present a card to use its special function, or block the drawing pile. The latter carries a penalty if the player does not reach 66 points.<br/><br/>If there are cards available to draw, a card is drawn after each trick. If it is not possible to draw new cards, players are obliged to match the trick's first card's color. Only if they can not, they are allowed to win by advantage.<br/><br/>The game's mechanics are easy to learn, but mastering it takes time, because there are many tactical ways to back your opponent into a corner.<br/><br/>&mdash;description from the designer<br/><br/>",

It includes:<br/><br/><br/>     4 laminated worksheets for the guessers, with 6 rows of spaces for the guesses, and a keyboard on the bottom to mark showing which letters are or are not included.<br/>     4 privacy screens for the guessers to hide their worksheets.<br/>     A laminated master sheet to record the current secret word, and the scores of all players. <br/>     4 black dry-erase markers, for the guessers. <br/>     1 yellow and 1 green marker for the referee. <br/><br/><br/>It does not include instructions, but it's easy to figure out the rules: <br/><br/>     In each round, a player is the referee and writes a secret word of up to 7 letters, and announces the length of the word. <br/>     The other players are guessers, and take simultaneous turns writing guesses of the secret word. <br/>     For each guess, the referee marks the guesses as in Wordle: letters that are in the right spot are circled green, letters in the word but the wrong spot are circled yellow, other letters are unmarked. <br/>     When a player guesses the word, the number of guesses is recorded on the master sheet. If they failed to guess it in 6 tries, a higher number like 7 is recorded. <br/>     After each player has had a turn as referee, the player with the lowest total guesses wins the game. <br/><br/><br/>",

All character have a unique ability that is always active and 2 super power that need energy to be used. Your goal will be to defeat other players' teams and be the last one standing on the board.<br/><br/>You start the game with a 15 actions cards deck that allow you to boost your characters, mainly charge their energy for their powers, you can also attack your ennemies or protect yourself. During the game you will be able to move around the board to seek for bonus that let you draw extra action cards, more powerful, or draw equipments that would increase your range, add extra damage to your attacks or give you extra health. If you seek for bonuses, you will make your deck stronger, give you advantage to your oponents by enlarge the possibility of actions.<br/><br/>Bonuses and turn order are set randomly at the begining of the game, each turn is by character order and not by players. The active character make all the action for himself but share the cards in hand with all the team the player control, so choose wisely wich character will use wich cards.<br/><br/>You start the game with a hand of 5 cards, each character's turn, you start by drawing 2 cards from your deck (if you start your turn on a bonus, you may draw card from the designated deck), you have 1 free movement to do whenever you want in your turn, you may use any number of cards from your hand, the only limit is for the attacks that are limited by 1 per turn (some bonuses can break this limit), then when you end your turn, you can't have more than 7 cards in your hand so discard the surplus.<br/><br/>When a character's health reach 0 he is eliminated and there is no way for him to come back, when all the characters from a team are eliminated, the team is eliminated and lose. When all other team are eliminated, you win the game.<br/><br/>-description from designer<br/><br/>",

But you better hurry &ndash; you&rsquo;ll be playing against the counter-hack program, which can introduce firewalls, freeze or corrupt your network and more.<br/><br/>GridHack is a game that takes place on a grid, similar to graph paper. Over a series of turns, you'll roll dice to add nodes, bugs, and grow your hacking network. Copy enough data before the counter-hack program completes, and you win the game!<br/><br/>On your turn you'll roll two dice. The result of the dice determine the actions you can choose to take on your turn - expand your network, or add a node or bug to your network. Doubles allow you to take both actions OR an action of your choice. You can also choose to ignore the dice rolls and take any action of your choice - but if you do, the counter-hack program gets to advance two steps.<br/><br/>After your turn, the counter-hack program goes. This is a pre-programmed series of turns designed to stop you from hacking the network and stealing data. The counter-hack program has one action it takes per turn. After the counter-hack program is complete, it is your turn again.<br/><br/>Play continues turn after turn between you and the counter-hack program, until you copy enough data and win, or the counter-hack program complete and you lose.<br/><br/>&mdash;description from the designer<br/><br/>",

Among them is the opposing gang of the dangerous Billy Kimber.<br/><br/>In this official game of the hit series, you slip into the familiar roles of the enemy gangs and try to seize the power of the city. In the roles of the Peaky Blinders and as Billy Kimber's henchmen, you face each other in Birmingham. Either you help Thomas Shelby with his plans or you try to sabotage the notorious gang. But your true identities remain secret, so you can't trust anyone in this game!<br/><br/>&mdash;description from the publisher<br/><br/>",

The players take turns to try and buy sweets from a shopkeeper (the player on their left), without the other Yankees finding out, because wanting sweets will damage their reputation. In Japan, Yankee is a broad term from 1904 meaning thug or tough, later being styled on the 50s rockers/bikers style, and then with punks.<br/><br/>The turn player looks at a theme card showing a list of different confectionery they want to buy, and then writes on a whiteboard. But they try to write in a way that only the shopkeeper will comprehend. If the gang of their yob friends can work out the sweets the player is trying to buy, they win the theme card, worth 1pt. But if the player can disguise their intent, and the player who's the shopkeeper this turn can also read it, they win the card instead.<br/><br/>So the player is trying to write the characters in a way that the shopkeeper will understand, but the others will not. For example, to order a Macaron the player might write Makron. The game is timed with a stopwatch, with the same time being applied to the Yankee and to the gang. So the faster the Yankee can complete their writing, the less time the gang has to work it out.<br/><br/>At the end of the game, the player with the most points is the winner, being the best at disguising and deducing.<br/>user summary<br/><br/>",

The game marks the 10th production of Polygonotes and features Hugame's innovative game system.<br/><br/>In the game, player's are aides of different princesses following the death of the emperor, trying to build up the nation. The previous emperor was a tyrant, shunned by the people, so many talented people were scattered all over the place. The aide's are using letters from the princess to bolster support from Masters in the regions and build their strength in the land.<br/><br/>The game works with a deck construction system and uses card placement to trigger the letters of influence (the title translates as Letter of Imperial Succession). The game is designed to be quick but intense, serious but easy to play though. As players develop their field, the goal is to send people to their own flag, building up Imperial Succession points.<br/><br/>Key to the game are the Letter cards. By placing other cards on a Letter, the player triggers action such as drawing cards, exchange cards for stronger cards, generate coins and so on. But the Letter cards are one-off and must be bought again and prepared before their effect can be used.<br/><br/>By drawing on the skills of a Master, the player can amplify their actions and attack their opponents by forcing them to reduce their hands of cards. By this way, the Masters let players use powerful cards quickly and not feel a mistake of buying the wrong card.<br/><br/>This combination of one-off Letters and powerful Masters means the player must try to build a strong set of experts to make the most of the preparation. By sending these cards to the player's own flag, the player who gets enough support wins by achieving imperial succession.<br/><br/>The Master cards also can improve by rotating in the tableau, so a merchant goes from generating 2 coins to 3 coins. This way, cards obtained early in the game remain useful as the players progress. <br/>user summary<br/><br/>",

Excalibur is the name of the sword that belonged to King Arthur. According to legend, Excalibur was forged in Avalon, the magical island of the priestess Morgana, the Lady of the Lake, located in the south of England. There are two versions about how the sword came to belong to Arthur, in those related to Lancelot and the Holy Grail, Excalibur was embedded in a stone and, in the other version, Exalibur was given to Arthur by Morgana, the Lady of the Lake. Excalibur could only belong to someone with a good heart, with extraordinary character and integrity, whoever got it would be the future king of Britannia, the old name of England when the tale appeared. In this game, knights from two different kingdoms must compete and at the same time face Celtic sorceresses, among the swamps, to have the right to conquer Excalibur, which is once again trapped in stone, right in the middle of Avalon. Only a true heir of Arthur will be able to accomplish such a feat.<br/>The game happens in a board with and octagonal grid. Knights move from octagon to octagon, while sorceresses move from square to square. Captures happens when two peons of the attacker (knight or sorcerer)are placed adjacent to the captured item, but diagonally opposite each other.<br/><br/>",

The rules are very simple: no two same sea creatures or colours can be side by side.<br/><br/>But watch your opponent &ndash; he could break your Aquario!<br/><br/>The game consists of a total of 60 cards, which are all shuffled together.<br/><br/>Most of the cards are animal cards (fish, crabs, starfish and turtles in different colors and point value). The remaining cards are action cards that allow cards that have already been placed to be moved.<br/><br/>The aim is to place nine of these cards in front of you in the 3x3 grid with as many points as possible.<br/><br/>The game ends when a player has created a completely correct aquarium (no touching of the same species/colors) or the draw pile is used up. When the game ends the player who scores the most points for their aquarium wins.<br/><br/>",

Chain jumps are also possible. The highlight, however, are long jumps, in which the same number of empty fields must always be in front of and behind another piece.

The cards feature the signature moves in a sumo bout (tachiai, early stage, middle stage, and dohyo edge). These have lines in colours (blue, pink, yellow) which branch off and join at the edge of the card.<br/><br/>The idea is that players choose cards to play which connect and form the flow of the bout. If players choose the same card, then the dice decide who wins and the loser turns their card down. If the players choose different cards, they follow the card instructions and use the dice to determine the outcome.<br/><br/>The opening move in sumo is a Tachai, when the players lunge forward, so gaining the advantage lets the player play more complex cards to grapple. The goal is to move the opponent to the edge and win by playing a move to get them out of the ring. By having cards with branches, the player can keep their options open and maintain an attack when blocked.<br/><br/>The gameplay is quite technical, and needs a good command of Japanese and an understanding of sumo. The game is designed to play quickly, closely resembling a real sumo bout.<br/>user summary<br/><br/>",

        "description": "イカイルカ？ (IkaIruka?) is a bluffing card game from Japan that raises the simple question we have all pondered at some time. Squid or Dolphin?<br/><br/>Players are trying to push each other to elimination by getting too many squid or dolphin cards in front of them. The start player picks another player and offers them one or two cards face down, saying Squid or Dolphin?. The target replies that the cards offered are Squid, or Dolphin, and the offer is shown.<br/><br/>If the target was wrong, the cards go on the table in front of them. If they get to 7 Squid, or 7 Dolphin, or 3 special &plusmn;ル (le) cards, they are eliminated from the game.<br/><br/>If the target was correct, the offer goes face up in front of the questioner.<br/><br/>The &plusmn;ル cards are used to swap a Squid to a Dolphin or the other way round. So playing a Squid plus a &plusmn;ル card means you have played one Dolphin. There are 12 normal &plusmn;ル cards, and 6 special &plusmn;ル cards, which have an extra effect, forcing the loser to pick up the cards in front of the other player.<br/><br/>A player is also eliminated if they cannot play a card because their hand is empty or they have only &plusmn;ル cards in hand.<br/><br/>There is a stricter rule which prohibits the same type being called in succession, and this can be waived by playing a card to your own field.<br/><br/>The last player standing is the winner.<br/>user summary<br/><br/>",

If you don't like the hero's weapon, you can use your skill cards to make the hero roll the dice again.<br/><br/>The fun part of this game is that when you play a skill card, it is played face down, so you can choose to bluff. For example, you play 'Skill 1,' but then claim, 'I played 'Skill 2.' When you plays a skill card, other players can decide whether to catch you.<br/><br/><br/>     If you are caught bluffing, that card is removed and has no effect. <br/>     If not caught, the card is successfully used to trigger the skill you claimed.<br/><br/><br/>Each player takes turns as the Control Freak Demon, and each Demon has three rounds. After each player has been the Demon once, the game ends, and scoring begins.<br/><br/>Go for it! The hero has only 3 rounds!

The theme is about a secret party where demons and foxes and humans and strange creatures gathered and boasted who was best at the performing arts. So they held a contest, but because the party was so noisy, it had to be settled by dancing.<br/><br/>Similar to charades, players are given a topic to express, and must follow a style such as Fluffy, Sneaky, Noisy and so on. If they can get the other players to guess the topic, they score points. Most points wins, but the real winner is getting people to show off.<br/><br/>The publisher says:<br/>鬼、狐、天狗、人間が種族を超えて寄り集まり、夜な夜な密かに開かれる怪しげな大宴会の話である。その席にて顔を突きあわせた各々の親分たちは、自らの種族こそ最も芸に長じていると酒の肴にとくとくと論議しはじめるが、めいめい一歩も譲らず埒が明かない。結果、百聞は一見に如かずとばかりに駆り出されたるはその子分たち、出されたお題にかなう踊りで芸を競い、逆に見物側はその踊りのお題を看破せよとの命を下される。だが、魑魅魍魎馳せ参じた宴の演台は喧騒凄まじく、とても一息にお題を伝えることなどできず、人づてに耳打ちする他はないが、さりとて面子を賭けた勝負ともあってずるをしないとも限らない。踊る阿呆に見る阿呆、夜は短し踊らな損々、恥はかきすて踊れよ乙女、前後不覚でどうなることやら、これより開宴どんちき百鬼！<br/><br/>user summary<br/><br/>",

The game requires assembly.<br/><br/>This game reproduces the fleet battles that were fought in the world of &ldquo;The Super Dimensional Fortress Macross&rdquo;.  It mainly deals with the First Macross War.<br/><br/>The game uses a combination of the show &quot;Macross&quot; and the movie &quot;Do you Remember Love&quot; for the settings in the game.  The players have units that are made from both shows and setting.<br/><br/>The game is a hex-and-counter wargame, typical of many wargame types, with ZOC's and CRT's. It comes with a map, counters that need mounting, player aids, and unit data sheets.<br/><br/>The sequence of play is:<br/><br/>Phase 1: Special Weapon/Special Action Declaration<br/>Phase 2: Initiative Decision<br/>Phase 3: Movement Phase<br/>Phase 4: Stealth/Dimensional Movement<br/>Phase 5: Air Operations<br/>Phase 6: Bombardment/Missile Attack<br/>Phase 7: Special Weapon Judgment/Special Action Execution<br/><br/>There are units for Zentraedi, Maltrandi, UN Spacy.<br/><br/>A second edition was made that added ships from the show Mospeda.<br/><br/>&mdash;user summary<br/><br/>",

        "description": "Wargaming rules for skirmish warfare among the drug cartels, policia, DEA and zombies.<br/><br/>The setting for DrugWarZ is time-period agnostic and could be any time from the 1980s through today. <br/>The weapons are generic enough that you don&rsquo;t have to worry about what type of sub-machine gun a mercenary is carrying, you just have to know it is an SMG. Same holds true for vehicles. A 1980s Toyota pick-up technical or a modern Ford Ranger with mounted machine guns will play exactly the same. And since we are not attempting to realistically<br/>portray everything (there are zombies, for crissake!), keeping things a little generic allows you to use the models you want.<br/><br/>The heyday of the drug cartel wars feels, to me, like it was the 1980s. Miami cops in flashy clothes and fast cars getting into shootouts with drug runners and their bosses. You knew who the good guys were (with the exception of the occasional corrupt cop storyline) and you knew who the bad guys were. Of course, the war on drugs continues each decade, a little different from the previous. Now we see government-sanctioned contractors going into countries and taking out targets, typically fueled by dark money and shady characters with their own agendas. Throw an out-of-control drug, some nefarious scientists looking to find short cuts, and bodies that won&rsquo;t go down because they need the drug and you have a formula for mayhem and chaos. Just the way I like a good zombie game.<br/><br/>The zombies in DrugWarZ are designed to be &ldquo;AI-driven&rdquo; so that each player can control their own force and the zombies can cause havoc with both. But a player is more than welcome to control the zombies instead. It will make them a bit more intelligent, in that the player can cut off escape routes or attack easier targets but they are still just zombies and will still go down with some well placed shots/blows to the head. Don&rsquo;t debate the logic of zombie actions if a player is running them. Just treat them as any other faction in the game. Finally, the model build section does not have a breakdown by faction. You can make a Rambo-style policia captain as well as a marksman Cartel boss or martial arts-master DEA agent. You will see some suggestions in the Faction section on how you could build your teams, but you can choose to completely ignore it and go your own way. Also, be sure to add some drawbacks. They make the game more interesting and give you more points to make that hero the way you want.<br/><br/>Welcome again to DrugWarZ be sure to keep your head on a swivel since you never know where the next RUSH zombie might appear from.<br/><br/>&mdash;description from the publisher<br/><br/>",

        "description": "GOLD RUSH is a game from Japan, themed on the American West in 1848. The publisher says it is based on a gambling game of the period. The game has a large number of wooden coins, held in a jute bag. Each player has a matchbox of matches, which they use in bidding for the coins. The coins have different values on either face, include poison and explosions.<br/><br/>In turn, a player draw a coin from the bag and auctions it off for matches. The player draws the coin from the bag, and looks at both sides secretly. Then they slap it down on the table and reveal only the face-up side to the other players. Now each player makes a bid for the coin using their limited supply of matches. The winning bid takes the coin but may not look at the hidden side. So players are trying to judge the hidden value from the lead player's bid.<br/><br/>At the end of the game, the players turn their coins over to find their real value, and then work out who is the winner.<br/><br/>The first edition was hand made, so few copies were produced and sold out immediately at the Tokyo Game Market in 2017. In 2020, the publisher finally revised the game and produced a mass produced version, crowdfunded through the Japanese platform Campfire. This had smaller and cheaper components, and all new artwork by a new illustrator, and JPN and ENG rules in the game.<br/>user summary<br/><br/>",

It develops on a particular board made up of thirty pentagonal squares, whose vertices form a total of sixty-nine intersections, on which the pieces are gradually positioned. When a player conquers the majority of the intersections of a square, the piece just played becomes neutral. The first player to connect two opposite edges of the board with an uninterrupted sequence of his own and/or neutral pieces wins.<br/>White begins. The player whose turn it is must place a pawn of his own color in any free (and not blocked) intersection on the board.<br/>The squares that share the vertex (or intersection) in which a pawn was placed in the immediately previous turn are called &quot;blocked&quot;. On the other hand, the boxes that have in common the vertex where a pawn was placed in the current turn are called &quot;active squares&quot;. Locked squares are inaccessible to the player whose turn it is.<br/>When, after playing a pawn, the player whose turn has occupied the majority of the intersections not occupied by neutral pawns in at least one of the active spaces, then that pawn will become neutral (grey).<br/>The first player who manages to connect two opposite edges of the board with an uninterrupted sequence of his own and/or neutral pieces wins. The dark edges (from h13 to l8 and from b6 to f1), the light edges (from b8 to f13 and from h1 to l6) and the gray edges (a7 and m7) are opposite.<br/><br/>&mdash;description from the designer<br/><br/>",

However, the ambitions of the rich and powerful clan were crushed under the booth of a cruel and merciless Elder. A few centuries ago, on the day in which the blood covenant would crown Wallachian as Vampire Lord, a mysterious uninvited figure joined the gathering and challenged him. The fight was short and the mysterious Vampire tore in half Wallachian and elected himself Vampire Lord. That night, no clan raised objections.<br/>Even Wallachian's first offspring was forced to bend the knee and its will to the new Lord. However, to honor his progenitor, he renamed himself Wallachian and the Vampire Lord accepted to let the clan preserve its name, but not its power.<br/><br/>The Wallachians were stripped of all lands and dens, their vampire minions enslaved in the ranks of the Vampire Lord. The remnants of the once-proud clan were relegated to a small mountainous region, in a ruined underground palace.

        "description": "All the farm animals are very excited! They are all gathered at the barn for the first concert of the looney barn band! <br/>They have practiced for this the whole month and now need your help! <br/>Every animal must make the correct sound! They must not make any mistake! <br/>However, the knotty parrot, the seal, and the blowfish came to distract the band! <br/>Can you help the farm animals sing accurately? <br/>In this hilarious memory-based game players try to memorize a chain of sounds without making any mistake!<br/><br/>▶GAME PLAY<br/>The youngest player starts by flipping a card and puts it next to the pile, starting the chain of sounds. Everybody can now see the animal he flipped. <br/>He then makes the animal sound, and then flips the card back. The card remains in its new position. The second player flips another card from the deck and places it next to the first card, continuing the chain of sounds. <br/>Now he has to make two sounds: the first flipped card, and the second, which was just flipped. Then he flips the card back. The card remains in its new position, continuing the chain of sounds. Play continues as each player flips over a new card from the deck and performs the chain of animal sounds or actions from memory. Simultaneously, players pay a careful attention, trying to catch the calling player with a wrong sound. <br/>The first player that thinks that someone had just made a mistake, (meaning that he made a wrong animal sound), must immediately put his hand on the card where he/ she thinks the mistake happened. If he/she was correct, he wins the card. If not, the calling player wins a card. All cards in the chain are then discarded and the play begins with a new chain of sounds all over again. When there are no more cards to draw the discard pile is sub eld to serve a new cards deck.<br/><br/>The first player to collect 4 animal cards wins the game.<br/><br/>",

        "description": "A fast-paced reimagining of a classic game. With sharks.  For 2 to 7 players.<br/><br/>Objective: clear your hand of cards by playing combinations and capturing cards from other players.<br/><br/>Components: Can be played with 2 standard poker card decks.  Remove the face cards and jokers and shuffle the rest together (total 80 cards). Shuffle and deal 7 to each player.<br/><br/>While Go Shark is inspired by Go Fish, key changes make it more competitive and faster paced.<br/><br/>Basic Play: Seek to collect playable combinations, by drawing cards and creatively asking the player to your left for a card meeting your custom criteria, such as &quot;4 or lower&quot; or &quot;an 8 or 9 of spades.&quot; But watch out, since each player can keep 2 protected cards (facedown), which can block your request.  If the request is not met, it moves around the table clockwise until either fulfilled or blocked.<br/><br/>Shark attack! Any played card can be captured with an exact matching cards, removing it from the opponents set or run and playing as an exact pair.<br/><br/>Winning: The game ends when a player clears their hand of all cards or when they choose to &quot;go out&quot; with 1 or more cards, yielding that many additional turns to the remaining players.  Win by having more point value in the played tricks using a nonlinear point system: 1 point value for any trick with 2 or 3 cards.  Tricks with 4 or more cards are scored that number of points. Cards left in hand do not matter, and tricks reduced to only 1 card (after shark attacks) are valued 0.<br/><br/>Go Shark starts with the &quot;Do you have an X&quot; mechanic from Go Fish, but deepens the strategy and risk. Keep your wits about you as you aim to clear your hand and outscore your opponents.<br/><br/>&mdash;description from the designer<br/><br/>",

The coins have different values on either side, including a crossbones and dynamite.<br/><br/>The player looks at both sides and places the coin with one side face-up. Both players then bid on the coin using their gold bars. The winner keeps the coin but may not examine the hidden side.<br/><br/>At the end of the game, the coins are all flipped and their real value is totalled. The player with the most value in total is the winner.<br/><br/>This mini edition was produced following the 2nd edition of the main game also being sold out. The designer created a 1 day crowdfund, and the mini edition sold out instantly. Demand was so high, the designer started a second 5 day crowdfund for the 2nd edition of the mini game. These mini editions re-used the original matchbox artwork, so the 1 day edition has a cattle skull on the matchbox, and the 5 day edition has a native American skull.<br/>user summary<br/><br/>",

        "description": "patisserie 3CARD is a two player card game from Japan using only 7 cards. The designer had published Cabaret 4 Card, in which players have only 4 cards each, but then thought if it could be minimised further.<br/><br/>The game was designed for a French patisserie in Kobe, where the chef wanted customers to play card games in the cafe.<br/><br/>In patisserie 3CARD, the two players have only three cards each. There is one start card which goes in the middle between the players. The 6 cards are shuffled and three dealt to each player.<br/><br/>The cards have simple logic instructions (Place, Do Not Place, Place Last One) and the players take turns placing one card to the left or right side of the middle card, or taking a card back. When placing, cards can be placed on top of another card, staggered to show the card below.<br/><br/>By placing the cards, the three cards form a sentence in Japanese. This sentence controls how the other player may proceed.<br/><br/>The first player to shed their three cards wins.<br/>user summary<br/><br/>The designer says:<br/>When you place a card, it becomes a sentence. It is a sentence like this: &quot;Place a card called &quot;Place&quot;&quot;, &quot;Do not place a card called &quot;Place&quot;&quot;, or &quot;Place the last card called &quot;Last card&quot;&quot;.<br/>The cards in your hand are played according to the sentence. If the sentence is not followed, the card in the field is added to your hand. The sentence structure is different between Japanese and English, so it is difficult to translate the sentence into English.<br/>publishers summary<br/><br/>",

The cards with high values have the weakest actions, and the cards with the strongest actions have the lowest values.<br/><br/>When the game ends, the player with the most points on their cards is the winner. So a player wants to gain a high value card, but that will make them vulnerable to attack. But giving their opponent a low value card will cause more damage to themselves.<br/><br/>The designer was inspired by watching a TV show in which rival teams were involved in match-fixing, and both were instructed to lose.<br/><br/>The game has a deck of only nine cards, and in the basic game, a set of seven are used. In the advanced game, all nine are shuffled and seven dealt out, giving a variation each time. There are also two tokens, Defence and Sleep, which stay with the player affected until the next round.<br/><br/>The card actions include Defence, Sleep, Robbery, Assassination, Exchange and Standby.

We don&rsquo;t think you should be forced to read a tome of rules before you can begin to have fun. The Rift Zone: Contact app knows all of the rules and will help you along the way. The first thing you should do is download the app from your favorite app store or by scanning the QR code on the website with your smart phone.<br/>Once you&rsquo;ve installed the app go ahead and open it. Great! You&rsquo;re ready to play!<br/>The Basic Game<br/>Every game has a host and players. The host chooses the rules of engagement and the players choose to join the game and select which team they want to support. In the app the host taps the &ldquo;Host Game&rdquo; button and selects the rules which are made up of the winning conditions, number of teams, and the allowed army power per team. <br/>Players select &ldquo;Join&rdquo; and select the host&rsquo;s game to join. Then they move their player to the team they wish. Everyone selects the units they will add to the team. Once all units have been added everyone presses the Ready button and the Host starts the game.<br/>A single game, or battle, is made up of multiple rounds. A round consists of multiple turns. Each unit takes a turn exactly once per round. Once a unit has ended its turn it cannot do anything other than evade or counter attack until the next round begins. <br/>You may execute your units&rsquo; turns in any order you want. You know it is time for you to make a move when the music for your faction begins to play on your smartphone.<br/><br/>During a turn a unit can move and spend action points. Movement limits differ between units and are measured in centimeters. A unit can split its move into as many smaller increments as needed and can take actions in between moves. Terrain will have varying impacts on a unit&rsquo;s movement depending on its movement type. Once a unit&rsquo;s movement is zero it cannot move again until the next round.<br/><br/>Action points (AP) can be spent on attacks and abilities. Each unit has a maximum number of AP and an amount they recharge between rounds. AP you do not spend during a turn roll over to the next round up to the maximum for that unit.<br/><br/>Attacks - Every attack is different. All attacks have a maximum range and formula for calculating accuracy at a distance less than the maximum. Likewise, most attacks have a maximum damage and a formula for calculating damage at a particular range. Attacks that do damage will do damage of a single type. Finally, some attacks may have special effects that impact the targeted unit if it is hit. An effect may do damage of a different type than the attack&rsquo;s primary damage. The more you play the more you will learn about the interactions of range, accuracy, damage, damage type, and armor. <br/>Abilities - Some units have special abilities that they can use to give them an extra boost. Some abilities can use AP to get extra movement. Others can repair damage or add defensive capabilities.<br/><br/>When you select &ldquo;End Turn&rdquo; for a unit, that unit cannot be used again until the next round. Any leftover AP will be available for evasion or counter attacks in the event the unit is attacked.<br/><br/>When the victory conditions set at the beginning of the game are met the game is over. That&rsquo;s it!<br/><br/>",

Using support elements such as artillery, calvary, irregulars, etc. the players will seek to complete a mission as set out at the beginning of the engagement.<br/><br/>The game also takes into account tactics that were used in the war and the generals who fought. This is my first game using the CHAOS system where even the best laid plans can be disrupted by the surprises of the battlefield. The unknown is a quantity of its own when it comes to Civil War Engagements.<br/><br/>Players will use support elements and tactical maneuvers to assault or defend various points of the battlefield. Formations will suffer losses and those losses will translate into lower effectiveness as the battle wears on. Reinforcements and reserves are limited so the player must make wise choices as to where they want to focus their strength and how they plan to wear down the enemy.<br/><br/>Engagements last from one to three days and at the end the winner is decided based on the number of forces that remain and the situational objectives. With territory cards that represent many of the most common grounds of the Civil War, players can develop battles that mirror those of history, from Gettysburg to the Fall of Richmond.<br/><br/>",

It is set during Japan's Warring States period (Sengoku-jidai) and plays 2-5 players.<br/><br/>To win the game a player must become powerful enough to either destroy all other opponents or become rich enough to enter Kyoto and declare themselves the winner.<br/><br/>On your turn you do one of the following actions: Departure, Tax Revenue, Navigation, Weapon Procurement, or Construction of Castles.<br/><br/>Money (koku) is raised by controlling territories. You draw a revenue card for this and follow the results.<br/><br/>With your money you can build armies of infantry, archers, cavalry, firearms and artillery in a territory by procuring them. This is done by paying 10,000 koku and spinning the wheel, which determines what is available. Navies can similarly be raised in territories with ports.<br/><br/>A player moves by the roulette's results; either 1, 2, or 3 territories can be moved.  A player can take control of a territory by moving armies into it and building a castle. The territory states how much to pay to do this. However, if there are enemy troops in the territory you must fight them.<br/><br/>Combat is resolved by drawing a card which dives the details of how victory is achieved (such as having the most guns).<br/><br/>&mdash;user summary<br/><br/>",

        "description": "&ldquo;As a consequence, carrier battles were risky, unstable affairs that hinged on striking effectively first. To do so, a carrier force had to locate its adversary before it was detected itself, or not long after.&rdquo;<br/><br/>&ndash; Robert C. Rubel, Deconstructing Nimitz&rsquo;s Principle of Calculated Risk<br/><br/>This is an expansion to my ruleset There's The Effing Scheer, which allows you to wargame early- to mid-war WW2 naval combat. This game adds an operational map for moving task forces, rules for fog of war, reconnaissance and detection, and aircraft carriers launching air strikes.<br/><br/>Aircraft carriers were a huge shift in twentieth century naval warfare. The ability to detect and strike enemies beyond line of sight upended naval strategy. The warship that had taken hundreds of thousands, if not millions, to build could be sent to the bottom by a handful of aviators shrieking in, dropping some ordnance then disappearing over the horizon.<br/><br/>When I first published Scheer over a year ago, I aimed to add a quick little expansion within a couple of months to bolt-on a mini-campaign system and get aircraft carriers into the fray. It has taken me a little longer, but it is a more substantial expansion that me and my playtesters are happy with.<br/><br/>As with the base game of Scheer, I wanted something that incorporated the fog of war and confusion of early carrier combat. Operating on half-information and making crucial decisions without all of the pieces in front of you are big parts of this game (in one Coral Sea game, I was defeated as the Americans by rushing my first strike on what turned out to be some cruisers, while the Japanese, now knowing where my carriers were, stuck effectively first and crippled both my carriers). I want to put you in the seat of Nagumo as he wonders whether or not to wait for better information or to launch now and hope you hit the right targets.<br/><br/>This game comes with rules for incorporating aircraft into the Scheer base game, generic operational rules for fighting multi-day engagements and four operational scenarios (Matapan, Java Sea, Coral Sea and Midway).<br/><br/>If you want to complete an operation in a day using a game which isn't going to take up all of your time, give realistic results and allow you to roll some dice with friends as you refight the early naval operations of World War 2, look no further.<br/><br/>&mdash;description from the publisher<br/><br/>",

The deck is shuffled and one card is placed face down in secret. The players are dealt the remaining cards (they don't have to be evenly shared).<br/><br/>Players then take turns drawing a card from their left neighbour. If the player can determine which is the secret card, they can declare it and check if it is correct. If so, points are scored by all players. Otherwise, they lay their hand out and are out of the round.<br/><br/>Alternately, the player might have a matching couple in their hand, and can choose to play these down into the open, or keep them in hand. A player that exhausts their hand is out and will lose one point in the round.<br/><br/>If only one player remains, they have a chance to declare the secret card and then the round ends.<br/><br/>Points are scored by adding the number of cards in hand plus 1 pt, scoring positively for a correct declaration and negatively for anybody else.<br/><br/>After three rounds, the player with the most points wins.<br/><br/>The game also has two marriage declaration cards and these are used in an alternate game, where a player is trying to get both declarations cards and only one person card in their hand. At this point, they declare which player they are marrying and lay their hand out for the win.<br/>user summary<br/><br/>",

In addition to this, you must be careful of how you make your way through this earthly world to be sure that Osiris will grant you passage to Aaru, the long-awaited heavenly paradise of the afterlife.<br/><br/>Throughout three eras, by means of a novel selection of actions that combine worker placement and tile drafting, players choose on each turn which area of Egyptian life and culture they wish to develop.

        "description": "Welcome to the grand arena of Heroes of Ilirium: Dual Deck Duels &ndash; a game where strategy meets fantasy, and where every choice you make shapes the fate of Ilirium!<br/><br/>In this dynamic 2-player card game, you don't just choose a hero &ndash; you draft two! And with 8 distinct heroes to pick from, the combinations are vast and strategies limitless. Our unique dual deck system breaks the convention: players wield not one, but two decks, each teeming with a diverse range of monsters and versatile utility cards. As you venture deeper, you'll find that each hero evolves, not just in story, but in power. With the collection of Soul tokens, heroes level up across three stages, each unlocking potent abilities that can sway the tide of battle.<br/><br/>But the intrigue doesn't end there. Every round unfolds on a new and unpredictable battleground. Tame wild beasts not native to your decks, harness their strengths, and surprise your opponents. While the heroes stand back from direct combat, their growing powers cast wide shadows over the battlefield, influencing duels and determining outcomes.<br/><br/>Are you ready to experience a game like no other? Dive deep, strategize, and become the master of dual deck dueling!<br/><br/>&mdash;description from the publisher<br/><br/>",

Only if the Guardian is defeated a player wins the game and becomes the supreme champion of the land.<br/><br/>To defeat a monster the Knight plays a Battle cards to perform an attack move. The attack moves range in difficulty, with more difficult attacks causing more damage to the Knight&rsquo;s foe. To calculate if the attack move is successful the player rolls a D12 and if the number is equal or greater than the number on the battle card the knight hits their target. If a knight fails an attack roll, they are hit and will take damage. The knight will also collect gold, magical items and be able to level up abilities to aid them on their quest.<br/><br/>&mdash;description from the designer<br/><br/>",

        "description": "&ldquo;Ship unmanoeuvrable. We shall fight to the last shell.&rdquo;<br/>&ndash; Vice-Admiral G&uuml;nther L&uuml;tjens<br/><br/>This is a scenario for my ruleset There's The Effing Scheer, and its expansion Striking Effectively First, which allows you to wargame early- to mid-war WW2 naval combat.<br/><br/>I really enjoyed researching, writing and playtesting this scenario. And it is a very challenging scenario for the Kriegsmarine. On the face of it, the tiny German task force should have no chance against the sheer numbers of the Royal Navy.<br/><br/>But then a wargamer's inquisitiveness kicks in... <br/>Did they need just one lucky hit to win that battle? <br/>Could they have brushed past a pair of cruisers the day before to prevent being shadowed? <br/>What if the Germans had tried a different route? <br/>What if Holland had let the German task force slip past his capital ships while waiting for Tovey to come up? <br/>What if that Catalina had never spotted Bismarck? <br/>Or that torpedo hadn't jammed the rudder? <br/>What if Bismarck had made it into range of its land-based air cover? <br/>For such a sure thing of a scenario, there were a lot of variables.<br/><br/>The German mission to harry the British convoy routes in mid-1941 was always to be a perilous one, as the quote above illustrates. British intelligence, combined with the substantial strength of the Home Fleet, gave the Royal Navy all of the cards, yet L&uuml;tjens and his task force came surprisingly close to success. There are a fair few special rules for this scenario to represent not just the huge scope of this operation (at double the distance scale of my other scenarios) but also to capture the game of cat and mouse the two navies played for several days.<br/><br/>This scenario allows you to play as Tovey, aiming to bring the elusive German warships to heel as the net slowly tightens around them, shepherding your convoys to safety. <br/>Or maybe you will play as L&uuml;tjens, hoping to repeat his earlier success in Operation Berlin by slipping past British task forces and wreaking havoc in the North Atlantic. <br/>Just don't expect all your ships to make it back.<br/><br/>-description from the designer<br/><br/>",

        "description": "The game board represents a pond that is divided into smaller and larger spaces. In the middle of the pond is a small raised plate as an island. The game includes spiders, frogs and flies. The spiders initially use the small island as a place to stay. The large spaces are intended for the frogs, while the spiders and flies are supposed to move on the small spaces. Outside the pond, on the edge, there are four crosses of yellow, green, red and blue colors. These positions are to be assigned to the frogs at the beginning of the game. The small green spaces on the banks of the pond are protective places; frogs cannot penetrate here. Up to four people can play, and each player receives a spider, a frog and four flies. Movement is determined by a die. The spiders may enter the game, when a fly of the same color reaches the space under the spider.<br/>The frogs eat spiders and flies and the spiders eat frogs and flies. The last remaining player wins the game.<br/><br/>The rules include a version without a die.<br/><br/>The game was published about 1940.<br/><br/>&mdash;user summary<br/><br/>",

You&rsquo;ve got to get them all, you can&rsquo;t afford to get hit.&rdquo;<br/>&ndash; Lieutenant Commander Elias B. Mott, Gunnery Officer for USS Enterprise<br/><br/>This is a scenario for my ruleset There's The Effing Scheer, and its expansion Striking Effectively First, which allows you to wargame early- to mid-war WW2 naval combat.<br/><br/>One of my favourite parts of wargaming are the what-ifs of history and how on the grand scale of things, so much seemingly comes down to luck. The best laid plans and all that. The Eastern Solomons struck me as an interesting engagement because both sides seemed to share an equal amount of luck, or at times a lack of it. It is almost like Coral Sea all over again.<br/><br/>The Americans start unlucky. They send a third of their carrier force away to refuel as their intelligence tells them they've got enough time until the Japanese offensive towards Guadalcanal will arrive. They are unlucky not to find the Japanese fleet carriers as the one accurate scout report is lost in the ether, and both of their strikes are wasted on secondary targets (though I'm sure the crew of Ryujo may feel differently). The Japanese were lucky enough to get the drop of the Americans, getting Shokaku and Zuikaku into strike range without being detected themselves, and getting the first punch in. American radar sends their CAP intercept up at the wrong altitude and the Japanese bombers attack. They strike first, but not effectively.<br/><br/>Then the luck seems to shift. <br/>Enterprise is hit by three bombs and its steering locks in a circle as the second wave closes in, but then the second Japanese strike fails to find them. The strike from Rabaul turns back due to bad weather and Ryujo's strike fails to neutralise Henderson Field. Nagumo, feeling his work is done, pulls the carrier air cover back, allowing the Cactus Air Force to sink one of their precious transports and parry the invasion. Both sides pull back claiming victory. The Japanese held the field, but any tactical victory seemed phyrric and strategically the Americans still held Henderson Field.<br/><br/>As always, I've added a few special rules to bring this scenario to life, allowing you to step into the shoes of Nagumo and Fletcher as they duel for the third time in 1942. Will Henderson Field fall? Or will the Americans sink the last two carriers who struck Pearl Harbor less than a year before?<br/><br/>-description from the designer<br/><br/>",

The capture of Ceylon, the consequent control of the Indian Ocean, and the possibility at the same time of a German conquest of Egypt would have closed the ring and the future would have been black.&rdquo;<br/><br/>&ndash; Winston Churchill<br/><br/>This is a scenario for my ruleset There's The Effing Scheer, and its expansion Striking Effectively First, which allows you to wargame early- to mid-war WW2 naval combat.<br/><br/>I have been interested by the what-if nature of the Indian Ocean Raid of 1942 for some time. While researching Coral Sea and Midway for SEF, I was struck by the fact I knew so little about the British capital ship losses (a carrier and two heavy cruisers) just a few months before these two huge, better known clashes. <br/>What had happened? <br/>And how had the Kido Butai got out of it unscathed?<br/><br/>After the string of British defeats in the Pacific with Japan's entry to the war, the British were on the back foot. Enter the Eastern Fleet, a motley mix of WW1 battleships, modern aircraft carriers and a jumble of other vessels thrown together to block further Japanese expansion. But it never directly fought the Japanese carriers, instead Somerville chose the far more sensible option of keeping the fleet 'in being' so as to remain a long-term threat. But what if he'd gone another way?<br/><br/>This scenario allows you to play as Somerville, aiming to engage the veteran Kido Butai in favourable night conditions and finally shatter the brittle sword of the Japanese carrier fleet. <br/>Or perhaps you will play as Nagumo, seeing if you can remove the Royal Navy thorn in your empire's side as it continues to expand in all directions?<br/><br/>-description from the designer<br/><br/>",

Truth seeks to triumph through cooperation and territorial control; Chaos is willing to sacrifice its own forces to lead to the opponent's loss; Death manipulates the flow of life to destroy the opponent's resources; Life is a quiet force that focuses on strengthening its allies; Lies uses trickery and traps to gain the upper hand; Order loves... to maintain order at any cost.

Players take on the role of students, juggling academics, social life, work, and wellness, while acquiring skills and filling their curriculum vitae with experiences as they prepare for their careers after graduation. A collaboration between Resolve, an applied game design research group at UNB and UNB's Career Development and Employment Centre, the game was designed by Scott Preston with consultation from career counsellor Nat Perry (M.Ed., C.C.C.).<br/><br/>The game takes place over four rounds (one for each year of a typical undergraduate degree). Players take turns drawing from a deck of action cards and choosing one to play. How many they draw depends on their current wellness level. The cards depict activities that a typical undergraduate student might do in college (join a student club, meet with their academic advisor, run for student council, etc.) Their choices impact four key areas (academics, wellness, curriculum vitae, and cash flow), all of which are tracked on a player sheet. At the end of each round, players may receive scholarships or summer jobs, depending the strength of the academics or the C.V. Then they pay for the next year's tuition and another round begins.<br/><br/>Included is a Facilitator&rsquo;s Guide that contains suggestions for how to run a session and tips for generating a productive post-game discussion.<br/><br/>&mdash;description from the designer<br/><br/>",

Each Location card has three of five possible symbols: Valour, Strength, Courage, Wisdom, or Spirit. Each Action Card has two random symbols on it. The deck of Location Cards is placed face down in the center of the table and the top three cards from it are laid face-up in a row. This is called the &lsquo;Display&rsquo;. The Action deck is placed face down nearby as a draw pile and the top card is turned face-up beside it to start the Discard pile.<br/><br/>Each player is dealt three Location Cards, which they place in a row face-up in front of them. This is their &lsquo;Array&rsquo;. The player is then dealt three Action Cards, which they keep hidden as part of their hand. At the start of their turn, each player either draws the top card from the Action deck or takes the top card from the face-up Discard pile, unless it is a Special card. Players may now do one of three things: 1) Play an Action Card from their hand to match one of the symbols on any of the Location Cards in their Array, or play a Special Action card from their hand and follow the instruction text; or 2) Re-arrange Action Cards which are already matched to Location Cards; or 3) Discard all your Action or Location Cards and draw three new ones. The player&rsquo;s turn has now ended.<br/><br/>At the end of their turn, the player must have three Location Cards in their Array, and three Action Cards in their hand. They must draw or discard as necessary, and also make sure there is at least one face-up card in the Action discard pile. If the Action Card deck runs out, the discard pile is turned over to form the new one, then the top card is turned face-up to form the new discard pile.<br/><br/>When all three symbols on one of a player&rsquo;s Location Cards have been matched, the player declares it &lsquo;Completed&rsquo; and places it face-down in their &lsquo;Completion Pile&rsquo;. They then draw a new Location Card from the Display and add it to their Array, and turn up a new card and add it to the Display. When a player has completed six Location Cards, they are the winner, unless the players agree beforehand to play to eight.<br/><br/>",

        "description": "The Game of Clock is a rather obscure Australian game that was meant to entertain and also teach children about the time. It is essentially a race game using a spinner and moving the hands of the clock<br/><br/>The game board has two clock faces with brass hands. Underneath each clock is a spinner with 3 inner circles of numbers. A player spins the spinner, then adds the numbers to give a count that moves the minute hand on their clock face.<br/><br/>The length of the game is predetermined before starting. i.e From 12 O'Clock to 3 O'Clock or 180 minutes. The winner is the first to reach the set time.<br/><br/>The game also provides facts about time, seasons (Southern Hemisphere), and celestial movements.<br/><br/>",

        "description": "In 55 and 54 BC, Julius Caesar landed in the south of the island of Britain, then known as Britannia. This was the first contact between Rome and the various British kingdoms. Numerous kings rallied to Caesar to survive, or to benefit from Rome's protection against the hostility of other British tribes: these were the first client kingdoms. This system would develop over the next century, so that by the time of Claudius' Roman invasion in AD 43, many client kingdoms were already well established.<br/><br/>Among these were the Regnenses, Brigantes and Iceni, who fought mercilessly for power. With Rome's support, they all tried to obtain the title of King of the British, in Latin: REX BRITANNORUM.<br/><br/>Rex Britannorum is a strategy game that can be played solo, with 2 or 3 players. Victory is achieved by occupying roads and cities in the different regions of Britannia displayed on the game board. Moreover, each player will have two personal objectives to complete, which will earn them additional victory points.<br/><br/>Commit your troops in the right place and at the right time to outplay your opponents. Resolution of battles is not random, so use your sense of strategy wisely to become the Rex Britannorum.<br/><br/>&mdash;description from the publisher<br/><br/>",

        "description": "Over 3 rounds, players will face off in this light strategy card fighting game. Determining their strategy for the fight, they will take a limited number of cards from their match strategy (deck) into each round. Revealing cards simultaneously one at a time each player will endeavour to land heavy hits on their opponent whilst blocking anticipated incoming hits. Bonuses can be gained by stringing together combos of cards, but is that what your opponent is trying to do or are they bluffing, hoping you will try to block while opening yourself up to taking extra damage from a different attack?<br/><br/>At the end of each round players return to their corners to be sponged down &amp; discuss new tactics. Two cards used in the previous round are discarded from the game and a new hand built from the remaining cards in their deck before the fighters square off again. Get knocked to the canvas and you will need to roll the knockdown dice to see if you recover and regain your feet before the 10 count is reached. It gets progressively harder to stand after each knockdown, and hitting the canvas for a fourth time means you have lost on a TKO.<br/><br/>Easy to learn &amp; quick to teach. New players will be off &amp; fighting each other in no time, &amp; the more they play the more they'll begin second guessing their opponent, acting out the moves, &amp; talking in an 'announcer' voice.<br/><br/>So will you be the heavyweight champion or are you nothing but a lightweight?<br/><br/>&mdash;description from the designer<br/><br/>",

You are having a beer with your gang of friends in the little village bar. In that little hole of a world, even the little grandson who comes in to get sweets for his grandmother has a history of mischief as thick as the sole of a Buffalo. You are playing trumps and the only winner is boredom, but suddenly (the) Noodle(s)? Tagliatella - your brother's friend - comes in, and with him the mathematical breakthrough! You're already up on your feet, about to shout &quot;Yo bro'!&quot; when that ridiculous ringtone for your aunt goes off from your smartphone at a criminal volume.&nbsp;<br/>&quot;HI DEAR, IT'S GRANDMA(AUNTY?! GO AND GET ME SOME CREAM FOR SORES AT THE CHEMIST'S, I'M ALL STUCK&hellip;&quot;<br/><br/>Smazzi &amp; Scazzi is an alternative to pick up and deliver games, a gateway with ruthless overturns and comically irreverent overtones, set in the worst squares of suburban towns where a micro-world of crazy characters with borderline habits live in captivity. Each player has errands to get out of the way before they can return to the bar as the winner. In order to do away with the errands, they can either actually run them or pawn them off on another player!<br/>Each errand (described by the TROUBLE (DODGE) cards) is a piece in a mosaic of interwoven stories. Each character who gives you assignments will have something to tell, short stories of escape from everyday life, great adventures or petty crimes; recipes of dubious taste, but also indestructible book odysseys. A game within a game or a comic within a game, which you can discover game by game or flick through card by card.<br/>&nbsp;<br/>To add even more spice to the matter, there is the contribution of an exceptional illustrator, the one and only person capable of giving volume to this human circus, Enrico Macchiavello, a Genoese artist with an immediately recognisable style, author of numerous works that for years have filled the happiest memories of all Italians (among the most important we recall the magnificent animations for the Ceres adverts, Skifidol, the album covers for Meganoids and Fragments, the comic 'Little Boy Goes to Hell&rsquo; and the more recent Zoombi).

You must step into the abyss of this ominous forest and unveil its horrifying mysteries. Four brave individuals, each with their own dark pasts, find themselves brought together in a chilling tavern. They don't know if they are chosen or mere pawns in this grim game of destiny.<br/><br/>Among them, an old mage who reminisces his ancient secrets in the darkness. A former professor of the College of Mages, whose insatiable thirst for knowledge has left only a bitter void. A warrior who has recently returned from a bloody conflict, his soul scarred by battle for the king. A young huntress, trading carcasses and bringing them to the local tavern, where she has found her refuge. The tavern keeper, a former herbalist, whose connection to this place is as mysterious as the Dark Forest itself.<br/><br/>In the Dark Forest, every turn is a step into the abyss, where darkness clouds the mind, and only chance can shed light on the path. Players explore locations, revealing cards that may hold treasures or horrors on their reverse sides. They might stumble upon quests, where choices will determine who remains in darkness and who attempts to unravel the bleak mysteries.<br/><br/>The game is steeped in darkness and tension, where every decision is a choice between life and death, between discovering the truth and delving deeper into a chasm of lies and secrets. In The Dark Forest, your soul is at stake, and only the bravest will emerge from it alive, undeniably changed.<br/><br/>&mdash;description from the designer<br/><br/>",

Two of the most notable of these privateers are The Crimson League and The Honorable Eclipse Company.<br/><br/>The Crimson League is led by Princess Scheherazade. Escaping the traditions of her royal family, she joined the Covenant of the Enlightened only to leave when the Egalitarian and Custodians schism came to the fore. Now, she operates following her own unknowable plan. Angry at the power of the Order within the Sultanate, she lashes out, taking contracts that appear to have nothing to do with the religious zealots, only for some to realise later that there was design all along.<br/><br/>The Honorable Eclipse Company have secured lucrative escort contracts with significant clients around the globe. The HEC offer security and defence solutions to those who cannot apply direct political or military action in safeguarding their investments. The HEC have had major investment from the Union of Federated States and often that Great Power has used the Company when the deployment or involvement of a Union battlefleet may be politically unwise. Though some might call the involvement of the HEC an unwelcome influence by the Union in global affairs, in truth, many commanders have found that their need for support in a theatre of engagement can only be solved by hiring the Honorable Eclipse Company.<br/><br/>Fortune and Glory contains two mercenary battlefleets that can be used with any Faction making this box set a must-buy for any Dystopian Wars player.

Players will face off waves of wild Dragons (and possibly dragons sent by other players), as they fight to grow their village.<br/><br/>The game is played over a series of rounds, which feature simultaneous play.  During a round, players will draw magical Orbs and combine some into stronger Orbs. All players then do the same with dragons (draw dragons and breed some into stronger dragons). Next, players will utilize command cards to decide in secret if they will go into battle and what their dragons will do (help them in battle, or go attack other players). All commands are then revealed at the same time.<br/><br/>Finally, all players who chose to go to battle will do so, each fighting their own battle. They will utilize the orbs and dragons they gathered earlier, along with their characters' special abilities, to fight off the wave of dragons attacking them (along with dragons sent by other players).<br/><br/>Each player who wins their battle will gain a new character in their village, but will also face a larger wave of Dragons in the next battle. The first player to get six characters and defeat the sixth wave is the winner.<br/><br/>&mdash;description from the designer<br/><br/>",

        "description": "Arcana Towers is a Tarot-themed board game set in a fantasy realm of Four Kingdoms. It revolves around all the cards found in a Tarot deck. The deck is split into two: the Minor Arcana and the Major Arcana.<br/><br/>The first goal is to collect face cards (Royalty Cards) from the Minor Arcana (which functions like a deck 56 playing cards) in order to collect stones (coin pieces) and draw from the smaller deck of 22 Major Arcana cards.<br/><br/>The overall objective is to win the game by collecting 11 towers which are denoted on a player's black die and red die. You gain towers a few different ways: by collecting 11 stones of a single colour, by collecting 3 Royalty Cards in a single Court on your board, or finally by the effects of Major Arcana Cards that typically grant stones or towers. All of your turn options are marked on a player's Turn Actions tile. There is an Opening Action, Main Action (4 choices) and an Elemental Action (fuelled by a unique Elemental ability and cards). Specialty Cards may also be played before any of these Actions.<br/><br/>Players take turn after turn until one of two things happens: 1: someone reaches 11 Towers, or, 2: the Major Arcana Deck runs out of (22) cards, (if the deck runs out one last turn is taken, and the player with the most Towers and Stones wins the game!<br/><br/>-description from designer<br/><br/>",

Mother Fox put down big mats in Baby Fox&rsquo;s room, and made the bed for the cubs, everyone changed into their pyjamas. But no one actually wanted to sleep! Instead, they hid under the blankets. Help Mother Fox find where everyone&rsquo;s hidden, and put them all to sleep!<br/><br/>In this game there are cards with baby animals in their pyjamas. You find tiles showing only a part of the animal cards because when they are hiding you only see an ear, a leg of a tail from them. You randomly draw 9 tiles and create 3 groups of 3 tiles from them. You have one minute to memorize each tile then you have to cover the tiles with the 3 little blankets. Shuffle the animal deck and in each turn you have two options:<br/>1.    Draw a card and if you think you saw that baby animal hiding under one of the blankets you take the card and it&rsquo;s the end of your turn. If you think the animal isn&rsquo;t hiding you can check the next card and decide to take it or leave it. Eighter way your turn is over and the next player comes.<br/>2.    If you think you forgot which animals are hiding you can choose to peek under one of the three blankets and refresh your memories. <br/>When the deck is empty you reveal the baby animals under the blankets and collect points if you remembered correctly. You can play many rounds and compare your scores at the end.<br/>The game has a cooperative version and variations for smaller and bigger children.<br/><br/>",

Speed is rewarded, but players must be careful not to misfire or they may find themselves in a high-stakes duel that might make or break their chances of winning!<br/><br/>The game is relatively simple. Included are a pair of dice and the Dot Duel Deck - 57 cards, each different from the other. Every card has 8 symbols representing a number 2-12 on it, and there may be more than one symbol representing the same number on a single card (though no symbol will be exactly the same on the same card). Every pair of cards has EXACTLY one matching symbol between the cards.<br/><br/>A turn starts with a roll of the dice and six of the cards face up in between all players. Then all players race to find and accurately count the number of matching symbols to the rolled number on a card, making a claim for the card once they&rsquo;re confident they are correct. Opponents check their claims, and can initiate a duel if they are incorrect. Claim a Double Dot, when two of the showing cards show an exactly matching symbol of the rolled number, and claim all six cards at once. Play ends when all cards are collected and victory is claimed by the player with the most cards.<br/><br/>Duels are an integral part of the game. In them, players put up cards from their collection in a one-on-one face off where they must race to correctly count the matching symbols among all the showing cards. Winner steals cards from their opponent, and a Double Dot allows you to steal their entire deck!<br/><br/>There are other variations of gameplay for beginners and younger players that promote fun for any audience.<br/><br/>-description from designer<br/><br/>",

Each chip is numbered and also has one of the 4 suits on it.<br/><br/>You shake up the chips (Very reminiscent of a Pringles can  and shape chip!) Letting them fall on the table top.  You take a short plastic colored stick and carefully pick up the potato chip you think you can remove and place it 12&quot; past the pile in front of you.  You can tap on a chip to turn it over.<br/><br/>There are variations of the game, based on the suit of the car and number pictured on the chips.  There are 4 game options to pick from before you begin playing.<br/><br/>&mdash;user summary<br/><br/>",

Defender, Attacker, Supporter. Master 3 different positions!<br/><br/>If even one person on the opposing team reduces their life to 0, you win! Even if you lose due to damage, there is always a comeback!<br/><br/>You become a 'small animal companion' who guides the magical girls, and forms a team with four magical girls of your choice. After confirming each other's teams, start the battle by placing three people as Defender, Attacker, and Supporter. Each magical girl has three command cards with the commands Defense, Attack, and Support written in pairs.<br/><br/>Each team's deck consists of 12 command cards from all four members of the team. The command cards of magical girls who will not participate in the battle this time will remain in the deck, so it is important to form a team while keeping the balance in mind.<br/><br/>Each turn, you choose two of the three command cards in your hand and play them half stacked to use three commands. The Defence command causes the magical girl placed in the Defender to use her special ability Defence Arts. Similarly, the Attack command is used by the Attacker, and the Support command is used by the Supporter. Defenders receive attacks from Attackers, and Supporters support them.<br/><br/>Repeat these steps and win if even one magical girl on the opposing team has their life reduced to 0.<br/><br/>Example of a magical girl:<br/>[Flame and Wings Protection Girl] Suparna Sowaka<br/>Her real name is Karutaya Kureha. She is a guardian girl who specializes in attacks. She transforms with the help of a bird that can control fire. Her special move is Sowaka Karura Burning, which turns flames into giant wings and burns the enemy from two directions.<br/>【炎と翼の護法少女】スパルナソワカ<br/>本名は「歌留多屋くれは（かるたや　くれは）」。<br/>攻撃を得意とする護法少女。炎を操る鳥の力を借りて変身する。<br/>必殺技は、炎を巨大な翼に変え、2方向から敵を燃やし尽くす「ソワカ・カルラ・バーニング」。<br/>description by publisher<br/><br/>",

In addition, 5,000 euros of starting capital is placed on the game board in the communal safe and taken out if necessary. The remaining money remains in the playing box, the &quot;bank&quot;, and is taken out when instructed.<br/><br/>GAMEPLAY<br/>The youngest pioneer in the round starts. He rolls the dice and moves forward by the number rolled. If the turn ends on a field with a number, the text for the corresponding field in the event booklet is read out loud and the task is carried out. If another person lands on the same space, the event must be carried out again. At the end of each month there are so-called &quot;decision fields&quot;. You have to stay on these fields, even if a higher number is rolled. If there are still numbers left, they expire. If a pioneer reaches the &quot;decision field&quot;, all other pioneers have to follow straight away. The person who gets onto the field first reads the task, leads the discussion and makes the final decision. Once the decision has been made, he can be the first to roll the dice again and move on.<br/><br/>GOAL OF THE GAME<br/>It's not about getting to the finish line first.

        "description": "HATTORI is a two player abstract game from Japan. Players move their pieces alternately orthogonally or diagonally. The winner is the first player to bring three of the neutral pieces home or capture three of their opponent's pieces.<br/><br/>The game is played on a small 5x5 grid. One player has five black tiles, the other has five white tiles, and there are five small green tiles which are neutral.<br/><br/>In opposite corners of the board is a section of three squares, which is each player's base. They start with three pieces in the base and with two adjacent outside. The green tiles are laid diagonally across the board between the bases.<br/><br/>The player's goal is to either bring three of the green tiles onto their own pieces and inside their base, or to eliminate three of their opponent's pieces (thus making it impossible to satisfy the first win condition).<br/><br/>The player pieces move in the direction of the piece's corners. A piece that is turned 45 degrees to the grid therefore moves left or right or up or down the grid, as a Rook in Chess does. A piece aligned to the grid will move diagonally across the grid, as a Bishop in Chess does. A piece can move as far as the player wishes but not through another piece including the neutral tiles.<br/><br/>On their turn, a player can Move, or Throw, or Wait. Whatever the player does, the piece used must be turned 45 degrees at the end of the action (which the publisher reminds us is easy to forget).<br/><br/>When a player moves, they can end their move on a green tile, and place it on their tile.<br/><br/>If a player's tile is empty, and an opponent's tile has a green piece, the player can move their tile onto the opponent's, taking the green tile and eliminating the opponent's piece. This opens up the possibility of tit-for-tat moves, immediately losing a tile. However, pieces inside a player's base are immune from attack.<br/><br/>Instead of moving a tile, a player can Throw a green tile from one piece to another of their own empty pieces. The throw has to be in the tile's orientation, after which it is turned.<br/><br/>Finally, a player can Wait, by simply choosing a tile of their own and turning it 45 degrees. Simply passing is not allowed.<br/><br/>The game was produced in a small tube, with the rules sheet also showing the grid board.<br/>user summary<br/><br/>",

        "description": "Rebel Tide: The U.S. Civil War, 1861-65 is a two-player strategic level game that places you in command of either the USA (Union) or CSA (Confederacy) during the Civil War.  Each turn consists of a year, during which multiple card plays occur.  These give the players movement, combats, entrenchments, and other actions.  At the end of each year, players must make critical decisions on which cards to re-buy in an attempt to win the war outright or to win by placing the other side in a disadvantageous position.  Rebel Tide is based on the popular, action-packed Imperial Tide/Pacific Tide game system by Gregory M. Smith, with many combat and strategic decisions to challenge players in just a single evening&rsquo;s game.<br/><br/>The core of the game is the unique card re-buy system, in which players take their annual production (adjusted for blockades and blockade runners) and decide which cards they need for the upcoming year.  Cards not only provide for reinforcements, but allow for movement, combat, and entrenchment.  Which cards to rebuy is without question one of the key decisions the player must make to prepare for next year&rsquo;s operations.<br/><br/>The game has infantry units for all of the major participants, cavalry, and artillery units. Naval operations are mainly abstracted, although the Confederate player must worry about Farragut invading a port from the sea.<br/><br/>Besides the focus on card play, the game features a small footprint (one standard map) and also is designed to be played in just a single evening &ndash; estimated at 3 hours for experienced players to fight the entire war.<br/><br/>One new mechanic in Rebel Tide is the Political Track, which is an abstract measure of the support of England and/or France to the Confederacy. If this track reaches the maximum early in the war, it can trigger an early CSA victory.<br/><br/>Another new key mechanic in the game system is the addition of historical Leaders, who range in ability from excellent (5) to poor (2). Bad leaders may be &ldquo;sacked&rdquo; and removed from the game and randomly replaced by the expenditure of a movement action. Leaders are vital in advancing after combat and also can add strength to an attack&rsquo;s total combat power.<br/><br/>A continued mechanic that was very successful in Imperial Tide is the use of Resource Points. Each nationality has a set amount, and there is an option to buy an extra point each year. Although mainly intended to replace infantry strength, they are extremely flexible in that they can be used in limited amounts for movement and combat operations. They can be thought of as a sort of &ldquo;operational reserve&rdquo; and should be used judiciously by players.<br/><br/>This game is highly accessible to those familiar with Imperial Tide or Pacific Tide, both designed by Gregory M. Smith. The game system lends itself very well to capturing the bloody and numerous battles of the U.S. Civil War.  While Rebel Tide is designed as a two-player gaming experience, an additional option for solitaire play is provided with the inclusion of a Solitaire Bot. This &ldquo;bot&rdquo; creates action priorities for the non-human player, and has the advantage of being simple enough to implement without spending an inordinate amount of time as the non-player.<br/><br/>Product Information:<br/><br/>Complexity: 4 out of 10<br/>Playing time: 3 to 4 hours<br/>Solitaire Suitability: 8 out of 10 (Solitaire Bot system)<br/>Players: Two (with option for solitaire play)<br/>Map Scale: Strategic; Abstract<br/>Time Scale: 1 year per Turn; each turn being composed of multiple card plays<br/>Unit Scale: Strategic (Infantry points, Cavalry points, Artillery points, and Leaders)<br/><br/>Game Components:<br/><br/>One Mounted game map, 22&rdquo; x 34&rdquo;<br/>One counter sheet, 9/16&rdquo; counters<br/>Two Player Aid Cards<br/>48 Game Cards (24 per side)<br/>5 Year Cards (double-sided)<br/>Rules Booklet<br/>Two six-sided dice<br/>Box and Lid set<br/><br/>-description from publisher's website<br/><br/>",

Lines shift quickly, orders get lost and suddenly you can find yourself behind enemy lines.

A group of independent-minded soldiers with a mutual goal for personal gain.

It was produced as two versions: Empire and American. A player could play the game as either side, or combine the two versions to play a full game.<br/><br/>The game is based upon the Battle of the Coral Sea, a significant naval battle in the Pacific theatre during World War II. During this battle, the two navies did not actually make contact. Instead, both sides used aircraft launched from carriers to attack the other side. The game simulates this form of combat.<br/><br/>The game is packaged in a large plastic envelope which has the rules, a large playing sheet representing the carriers in an abstract form, and a set of cards for aircraft from each side. The technical drawings of the aircraft are taken from Wikipedia Creative Commons.<br/><br/>In the game, a player must position aircraft on their flight deck and send them up into formations, where they are met and countered by opposing aircraft. The player uses dice to resolve combat between the planes. Then the surviving aircraft must return and land safely. A player can only keep an aircraft in a holding pattern for one turn. If it cannot land after that, it is lost into the sea.<br/><br/>Each player has fighter aircraft and bomber aircraft. The objective is to get the bombers past the fighter defence and to sink the opposing carriers for victory.<br/>user summary<br/><br/>",

        "description": "Horrorshow is a televised romp through a sadistic, otherworldly game show&rsquo;s studio full of monsters and mayhem where we humans are low on the food chain.  The 36 contestants are trying collectively not only to escape, but to do so with enough points to keep the sponsors happy.<br/><br/>Mechanically, you will move your 6 teams of contestants down many corridors to obtain studio cards (representing rooms in the game show's studio) that are worth points.  These cards can also combine to spell EXIT, without which those points are worthless.  Unfortunately, these studio cards will also often cause a small drop in sanity.  So why the hurry to go in?  Well, chasing these contestants through the corridors are the insatiable Horrors who will have a strong part to play in dwindling the number of your contestants throughout the game.<br/><br/>You must manage the sanity of your contestants, worry about which contestant completes each corridor and claims the studio card, mind the number of cards left in the movement card deck, and keep up a brisk pace in the corridors ahead of the fast-moving and eponymous Horrors.<br/><br/>And even if you manage to get someone out... you need to hit a particular points threshold to win.<br/><br/>This game can be difficult.<br/><br/>&mdash;description from the designer<br/><br/>",

That is the only similarity because each has a unique mechanical system for the expelling of the food.  Phil is a large mechanical head with a small opening for his mouth where you feed him different foods.  There are dice and cards involved in the game.<br/><br/>Game Play:<br/>All the p[layers roll their (soft) die  at the same time<br/>(There are stipulations)<br/>1. Everyone rolls the same number:  Reroll<br/>2. All players that roll the same number skip that turn of feeding Phil<br/>3. The remaining players or the ones that did not roll the same number which could be all four players, then must feed chuck based on the highest number going first<br/><br/>Fill Phil's mouth with the amount of food you rolled on the die<br/>As you fill his mouth he begins to expand until he eventually POPS open!<br/>If you made Phil UP CHUCK, then you flip over one of 4 shirt cards over in front of you.

There is a smoother side and a courser side depending on which is easier for you to launch.<br/><br/>Unlike Tiddly Winks, you are aiming to get one of these special winks in either of the Clowns eyes or in his mouth.  The points are different because the eyes are harder to get the wink into.<br/><br/>Points<br/>10 points for each wink that lands in his mouth<br/>50 points for each wink that lands in his eyes<br/><br/>The winner is the individual player or the team that gets to 150 points.<br/><br/>Parts include the clown and stands - 6 Blue and 6 Red Winks and 3 white target cups (which look like the top of a paint spray can)<br/><br/>",

        "description": "There are four starting places on the board. Each player takes 4 figures of the same color and places them in the starting position of the same color. The players take turns to roll and move. When moving, one skips over all other figures and only counts the empty spaces. The winner is the player who brings his 4 vagabonds to the finish line first.<br/><br/>One can only start after rolling a 1 or 6. Whoever rolls 1 places a figure on space 1 of their driveway. Whoever rolls 6 moves forward 6 spaces and comes to their own intersection and can roll the die again. On the roll of a &quot;one, he may immediately jump to the finish. On any other roll he has to enter the round course around the board.<br/><br/>If a figure lands on a space with a figure of the same color, it sits next to it, rolls again. But if a figure hits a figure  of a different color, it is pushed off the path. The pushed figure must go into the starting place at the next intersection behind, even if it is a foreign starting place.<br/><br/>After completing the circuit, the figure has to stop at its stopping point. Only the next time a 1 is rolled it is allowed to jump from the stopping point to the finish. As long as a figure stands at its stopping point, subsequent figures of its color may jump over it's back to the finish with every throw that extends beyond the stopping point. If a figure of another color is sitting at the stopping point, a figure of the color of the stop point is blocked and may not jump over it to the finish.<br/><br/>&mdash;user summary<br/><br/>",
