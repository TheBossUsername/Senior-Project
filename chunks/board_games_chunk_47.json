All ship statistics have been simplified, and the system uses only six-sided dice.<br/><br/>All of the rules and navy lists can be found in the files sections. Navy lists include ships, aircraft, bases, and special rules. Operational maps can be downloaded in both the files section and under the web links. Future maps covering the Arctic and Indian Ocean will be available in the future.<br/><br/>The following navies are represented in the game: America, Argentina, Australia, Brazil, Britain, Canada, Chile, China, Colombia, Denmark, Finland, France, Germany, Greece, Italy, Japan, Mexico, Netherlands, New Zealand, Norway, Peru, Poland, Portugal, Romania, Soviet Union, Spain, Sweden, Thailand, Turkey, and Yugoslavia.<br/><br/>Also, for fun there are hypothetical navies for the Confederate States of America and the Austro-Hungarian Empire.<br/><br/>",

From a simple set of rules emerge surprisingly complex strategies.<br/><br/>SETUP:<br/>Distribute Blinks evenly to all players (minimum 4 Blinks/player). Each player chooses a team color and sets their Blinks to that color by double-clicking. Once all players are set, recombine all Blinks into a starting arrangement with colors segregated.<br/><br/>GAMEPLAY<br/>The object of this game is to make your Blinks &ldquo;happy.&rdquo; In order for a Blink to be happy, it must be:<br/>a) touching at least two other tiles, AND<br/>b) not touching a tile of its own color<br/><br/>On their turn, a player makes a fracture by splitting and separating the cluster into two smaller clusters. The clusters can be of any size; they do not have to be equal. You can choose to only move a single Blink, and you can move any tile, not just the ones of your own color.<br/><br/>Fractures must be able to be slid into and out of place while remaining flat on the table. They also cannot split the board into more than 2 halves.<br/><br/>The player then reconnects the two clusters in any way they choose. Once a player has finished their move, play passes to the next clockwise player.<br/><br/>WIN CONDITION:<br/>The game ends when, at the end of a turn, a player has made all of their own color Blinks happy. In games with neutral Blinks, they must make all neutral Blinks happy as well.<br/><br/>This game is played with Blinks, the world's first smart tabletop game system.<br/><br/>&mdash;description from the publisher<br/><br/>",

        "description": "Nuclear Renaissance is a post apocalyptic themed, turn based, table-top strategy game. <br/>It uses 28mm figures and vehicles. Players play a gang of hardened fighters, pitting themselves against others in the wastelands of the future.<br/><br/>The Tome of Tridlins is a supplement for the game Nuclear Renaissance that really completes the game. The core game rules can be downloaded for free from the Ramshackle website or a printed version can be had from the web store. The Tome of Tridlins adds much more detailed gang design rules, along with a full campaign system and more background.<br/><br/>The main aspects of playing Nuclear Renaissance that sets it apart from other games are that it is great for multiple players and that the gang creation rules are really versatile.<br/><br/>The multi player aspect of the game makes it great for gaming groups. Three player games are easily handled, while even five or six players can get through a game in three hours or so. The rules are really designed so that any sized gaming group can have fun together without feeling that the person to go last is at a disadvantage, or that one player has to get left out. The game is biased towards playing campaigns, where players develop their gangs. The new book, the Tome of Tridlins, gives full rules for playing campaigns. This means that players can always get a game in a campaign even if only three people show up for a gaming night! What this comes down to is that gaming groups can easily fit the game around the players that show up and the boards that are available, rather than the other way around.<br/><br/>The gang creation rules were made with the idea of letting players play any type of gang that fits their fancy. Players can choose to play biker gangs, zombie hordes, all animal beast packs (monsters included), bands of mutants, robot death squads and even military conclaves. Players can even mix them all up, to have robot driven battle trucks packed full of mutants, zombies and wild animals with a mighty hero in charge! Vehicles are fully integrated into the game play and there are comprehensive but simple rules for designing ones that suit your gang. Within the gang design rules, players are set very few limitations. There are hundreds of options for making really unique forces. This complexity is condensed down onto simple gang rosters that can easily hold all the information you need to play with, without having masses of notes, counters, cards and other paraphernalia.<br/><br/>The problem with having very open gang design is keeping the game balanced. After six years of testing, the final result balances player gangs in a number of ways. The first is a points system, where each player is given a set amount to spend building their gangs. In campaigns the players are awarded more points as they play more games but the campaign system keeps players who miss gaming nights in the loop. Its easy to catch up, even if you lose! The second way to balance the game is that more power leads to less versatility. Power hungry &quot;one man armies&quot; don't get many tactical options and are often left waiting while the other players take their turns with larger gangs. The game works with players alternately activating characters, so gangs with the average ten or so members keep playing throughout a turn.<br/><br/>The game is aimed at players who want a new gaming system, nothing too complex to learn but with a lot of options. The game features solid mechanics and balance, which means that its robust enough to play well, but loose enough to let players use their imaginations. Power gamers can indulge their lust for super armoured laser cannon wielding death knights mounted on super bikes but will find that the other players in their gaming group will have the flexibility to constantly undermine their power gaming tactics. On the other hand, players who want to concentrate more on the theme of their gang will find that its easy to build forces that are powerful but have plenty of room for idiosyncrasies and whimsey!<br/><br/>Ramshackle Games already produces hundred of miniatures to play Nuclear Renaissance with. Players will find that most of the options in the books are covered in one form or another, so its easy to get a really thematic gang together right from the get-go.<br/><br/>",

From the APL website...<br/><br/>&quot;Different courses of the Great War might well have seen warships of the Marine Nationale or Imperial Russian Navy serving under British or German colors: taken as booty by a victorious Germany (the actual fate of Russia&rsquo;s Black Sea Fleet), seized by Britain to prevent their falling into enemy hands following the defeat of an ally, sold in the face of more pressing priorities on land or a different ending to hostilities. Transferred to the North Sea arena across which the war&rsquo;s two principal naval antagonists faced each other, the more modern of these ships could well have played critical roles in determining whether Britannia or Germania would ultimately hold Neptune&rsquo;s Trident.<br/><br/>Prizes of War is a supplement for the Great War at Sea series that allows players to examine this question of alternate history. French and Russian ships from our Jutland and Mediterranean games are allocated to the Royal Navy and Kaiserliche Marine, and included in a series of 10 battle and 11 operational scenarios set in and around the North Sea.<br/><br/>Prizes of War includes 70 playing pieces (you will need to assemble these yourself) and this booklet. Playing all the scenarios in this supplement requires the included pieces plus maps and pieces from our Jutland game (and no others!).<br/><br/>Prizes of War is sold exclusively via .pdf download. The playing pieces are not die-cut and mounted, nor is the scenario book printed. Instead it comes as a series of .pdf files that will need to be assembled into the game&rsquo;s components.&quot;<br/><br/>",

It includes Hive: Original, Venom, Swarm, Predators, Guardians and Honeycombo.<br/><br/>Hive: Venom &ndash; Includes all the original pieces in addition to some new creatures on the reverse sides. You must decide which face up to place the pieces depending on the current state of the board and your future plans. You can flip the pieces but this will cost you a tempo. The new pieces are designed not to over power the Originals be rather to compliment them and present the player with more strategic choices.<br/><br/>Hive: Swarm &ndash; A mode of play which adds in a little bit of randomness to Hive and challenges the player to make the best use of the hand they are dealt. It can be played with Hive Original or any of the expansions and even allows you to place your opponent's pieces!<br/><br/>Hive: Predators &ndash; Introduces some powerful pieces with killer moves which can permanently remove an opponent's creatures from the Hive. It also introduces the alternative victory condition of removing your opponent's Queen Bee which encourages even more interesting ways to play and the greater possibility to come back from a losing position.<br/><br/>Hive: Guardians &ndash; Dominate the top of the Hive with these high flying creatures. You now have to fully surround the Queen Bee so even the top must be covered to win. They can also be very useful in neutralising some of the new expansions when playing with all the expansions together.<br/><br/>Hive: Honeycombo &ndash; This piece is shared by both players which allows you sacrifice your current turn in order to then play two moves in your next turn. This opens up many new possibilities such as being able to place and move a piece without it getting pinned, or moving two pieces in to surround the Queen without your opponent being able to move one away with the Pillbug.<br/><br/>Please see attached files for the rules and print and play stickers.<br/><br/>",

The game map shows most of California (known as Alta (upper) California. The owners are Mexico &amp; the Californios or Californians). The object of the game is for the Californians to retain Alta California while the goal of the Bear Flaggers and United States troops and sailors is to seize the soon to be Golden State. The fighting itself was not particularly bloody and involved relatively small numbers of troops. There are two major events that influence the course of the game. One is the outbreak of the Bear Flag Revolt just before the formal Declaration of War between the United States and Mexico is known of in California. The other is the rebellion of Southern California over the initial occupation by the Americans. The game is a TWO-ACT play. Several key and often-random events may play a powerful role in he final outcome of the fighting. The game will take 1-3 hours to play to completion.<br/><br/>&mdash;description from the publisher<br/><br/>",

When Maximilian visited Bruges in 1488, the people decided to revolt. They were able to imprison their monarch for over four months. Out of vengeance, Maximilian imposed a prohibition to organize festivities and fairs. To calm him down, you as the people of Bruges decided to organize a celebration to honor Maximilian.<br/><br/>In Parade of the Bruges fools players take on the role of a medieval labourer living in Bruges. Together, you try to gather musicians, acrobats and jesters to join a big parade in honour of Maximilian in order to earn his respect and therefore more freedom. However, the player who surpasses the expectations of grumpy Maximilian, wins this game and becomes mayor in Bruges.<br/><br/>Each turn, players perform one of three actions:<br/><br/>     persuade an artist by offering a drink in the local bar<br/>     play an artist into the parade and score (some artists have the possibility to move other cards one space or to swap with a card)<br/>     rest (by taking back into your hand all of the cards you needed to persuade artists)<br/><br/><br/>When an artist reached the seventh column, the parade is complete and the game ends.<br/><br/>In the advanced game mood bonusses are dealt to the player(s) who took most notice of the King's temper (3 out of 20 mission cards).<br/><br/>",

That's why they're looking to adopt a new kitten to learn all about being a witches' cat!<br/><br/>Each player controls a magic copy of a cat, who will try to showcase their skills to either reach the tower at the center of the board or capture 3 cats from other players.<br/><br/>Every turn they will place their movement tile on the table and, in ascending order, jump to an adjacent roof with the same color or number. They can also use magic portals to navigate from one edge to another.

        "description": "This expansion for Magic: The Gathering is the first-ever draftable Commander experience!<br/><br/>In the Commander format, players have a legendary creature who serves as the deck's commander. That creature is set aside at the start of the game, and can be cast as if it were in your hand. Normally, this is done with a 100-card singleton constructed deck. However, Commander Legends gives it a new twist. When drafting Commander Legends, each player opens a 20-card booster pack, selects two cards from it, and then passes the pack to the player sitting next to them. They then pick two more cards from the pack they've been handed, and so on, going around the table until all cards are picked. This is repeated with a second booster pack, and again with a third, until everyone has picked a total of 60 cards. Players then choose a commander (or a pair of commanders that both have the Partner ability) from among the cards they drafted, add any number of basic lands, and build a 60-card deck. Then everyone shuffles up their decks and battles in a free-for-all! (A larger pod of drafters splits into two groups first.)<br/><br/>The set is sold in draft boosters and collector boosters, and contains 361 cards (141 commons, 120 uncommons, 77 rares, and 22 mythic rares, plus the Prismatic Piper, a special helper card who appears more frequently than a common), plus a selection of 32 legendary reprints from past sets who appear with an all-new foil-etched treatment in collector boosters and, on rare occasion, in draft boosters as well. Two preconstructed Commander decks, &quot;Arm for Battle&quot; and &quot;Reap the Tides,&quot; were also released alongside the main set.<br/><br/>",

First published in 1980, it has undergone several major revisions, with the last, Harpoon4.1, being printed in the late 1990s. Although the system has remained fairly stable, naval technology has continued advancing, and there have been further developments in the game systems as  more information has been acquired. Harpoon 5 consolidates this knowledge and standardizes Harpoon with the other products.<br/><br/>The era of modern naval combat began on October 21, 1967 when Egyptian missile boats launched four Soviet made Styx surface-to-surface missiles and sank the Israeli destroyer Eilat at a range of 13.5 nautical miles. The face of naval warfare changed forever!<br/><br/>Harpoon 5 handles all aspects of modern maritime combat: surface, sub-surface, and air. Harpoon 5 is a system of detailed but comprehensible rules covering the many facets of modern naval actions. Consistent rating systems and evaluations of the capabilities of modern naval vessels, aircraft, submarines, and helicopters make it possible to achieve realistic results when simulating known situations, by extension Harpoon 5 also achieves realistic results with hypothetical scenarios.<br/><br/>Harpoon 5 can answer questions like:<br/><br/>Are carriers powerhouses or sitting ducks?<br/>Can transatlantic convoys survive in a modern wartime environment?<br/>In the cat-and-mouse games between US and Russian submarines, which is better?<br/><br/>&mdash;description from the publisher<br/><br/>",

Historians prophesied that t heir union -- and the union of their two Houses -- would usher in an age of peace and prosperity not seen since the fall of the Star League. But they were wrong -- because even as the marriage ceremony took place, thousands of BattleMechs stood poised to launch one of the largest military campaigns in centuries!<br/><br/>The BattlePack is a new and innovative game supplement that requires only the contents of the BattleTech 4th Edition boxed set to play, making it ideal for the beginning player while offering seasoned players the opportunity to experience the BattleTech universe as it began. BattlePack: Fourth Succession War is based on events in Michael Stackpole's classic Warrior Trilogy novel series. From the opening salvos until the final shots ring out, this supplement takes you step-by-step through the titanic struggle known as the Fourth Succession War.<br/><br/>This expansion features:<br/><br/>Ten new, ready-to-play scenarios.<br/>The new, never-before-seen Woodland BattleTech map.<br/>Eight additional BattleMech record sheets, four of which are new variants:BJ-3 Blackjack, HOP-4B Hoplite, CTF-2X Cataphract and CGR-1A5 Charger.<br/>20 full-color stand-up playing pieces.<br/><br/>User comment:<br/><br/>This BattlePack is out of print, and it's increasingly difficult to find a complete pack that includes the playing pieces and map. Although it's described by FASA as their first BattlePack, it was also the last.<br/><br/>The main sourcebook itself is still useable without the pieces although just over half of the scenarios in the pack use the Woodlands Map when setting up the map.  It's unclear if the map will be re-released at any point by the current licence holder, although other heavily wooded maps with hills such as the two Rolling Hills maps re-released in the Classic BattleTech Map Compilation 1 are reasonable substitutes. The four new 'Mech variants described as new with this expansion have since been re-released in various other expansions.<br/><br/>",

        "description": "DECEMBER 1944, THE BELGIAN ARDENNES...<br/>With the German army seemingly on the verge of defeat, the F&uuml;hrer ordered it to stage a new surprise attack, aimed at splitting the Allied army's advancing on Germany. Timed to utilise the winter weather, Operation Wacht Am Rhein committed Germany's last reserves in an ambitious gamble to turn the tide of the war.<br/><br/>On December 16th, the offensive struck in the Ardennes forests. The unexpected attack would become the largest American battle of the war in Europe...<br/><br/>&bull; BACKGROUND<br/><br/>A general overview of Operation Wacht Am Rhein, from the initial infantry offensive on day one, to clear the routes for the following panzer attacks on day two. It  covers; 6th Panzer Army in the north in hard fighting for the Elsenborn ridge and the deep penetration of Kampfgruppe Peiper. 5th Panzer Army's drive in the centre and the surroundings of St Vith and Bastogne. 7th Army's supporting attack in the south.<br/><br/>&bull; ARMY LIST<br/><br/>Designed to be used with the army lists already published in Battlegroup Overlord, this book contains a single new army list, for the freshly raised Volksgrenadier Divisions, as well as many new additions to the Overlord army lists for refighting the battles of late 1944. It also includes units for the German disguised infiltration teams of Operation Greif.<br/><br/>&bull; SPECIAL RULES<br/><br/>New special rules to adapt the core Battlegroup game to the winter battlefields of 1944-45. The rules recreate the character of the Ardennes fighting, with German infiltration tactics, the morale effect of their powerful surprise attack and the winter weather's limiting of Allied air support, along with the snow falling to impede operations on the ground.<br/><br/>All help to create games with the distinctive feel of the bitter 'Battle of the Bulge'.<br/><br/>&bull; SCENARIOS AND CAMPAIGN<br/><br/>Nine new historical scenarios, including a detailed narrative campaign for Kampfgruppe Peiper's  ill-fated race to the Meuse river.<br/><br/>72 page softback campaign supplement detailing the Battle of the Bulge in the Ardennes December '44 - January '45<br/><br/>Please note you need the Battlegroup Overlord campaign supplement and the mini ruleset to play Wacht am Rhein.<br/><br/>",

Each game is either fully cooperative or one-versus-all, only you have no way of knowing which one..<br/><br/>The game is for 2-5 players where one player plays as a spirit with unknown intentions. The others play as the visitors, who need to work together to determine whether the spirit is on their side, while also trying to find out what it wants. The visitors will try to work together while struggling with darkness, isolation and the constant haunting of the spirit, who in turn either tries to earn their trust or secretly plan their demise.<br/><br/>A Game About Trust<br/>Regardless of the intentions of the spirit-player the trust of the visitors is valuable to its goals. A benevolent spirit needs their trust to play its more powerful actions. If it does not believe that they will manage in time it can instead turn on them and win by other means. A vengeful spirit can bide its time, sabotaging their efforts in hidden ways and use their trust to make the visitors expose themselves. Then, when they are vulnerable it can reveal its true nature..<br/><br/>Game Mechanics<br/>The visitors are represented on the board while the spirit moves through the house ethereally and can be in multiple locations at once. While visitors are limited by doors and passageways, the spirit can move freely, surrounding them.<br/><br/>While the spirit-player may have very limited means to communicate, the visitors have an even tougher choice to make. If they separate and go different ways they will not be able to speak at all. Then, they can only watch on in horror as their friend must make a perilous choice with no support.<br/><br/>The actions of the spirit leave clues as to its true intentions, and when the secrets of the house are gradually revealed the visitors may realize what they think they know is fatally wrong..<br/><br/>",

In the game, you step into the battles of wizards, aiming to defeat your opponent through spells, creatures, and better strategy. You can choose the path of dark curses, destructive fire, binding frost, or forest wisdom. A portion of your cards must be used as a source of magic, and then you decide whether to attack, build defense, or purchase new cards that can eventually lead you to victory.<br/><br/>During the game, you will encounter three types of cards: Spells, Creatures, and Defense. Spells represent a one-time effect that is executed immediately, and the card itself then goes to the discard pile. Creatures and defense, on the other hand, remain in play in front of the wizard in a row until the opponent destroys them. The order of the cards placed in the row matters because the cards in the middle are protected by those on the edges.<br/><br/>The game features a large number of unique cards, each with non-repeating effects. Each match provides new possibilities and combinations of individual game effects. Therefore, you must adapt your gameplay strategy based on what is currently available in the wizard's store. In addition to cards, there are three types of tokens and crystals in the game, representing the freezing effect. This allows you to, for example, cast a curse on your opponent that gradually poisons them or freeze them to prevent them from casting further spells.<br/><br/>&mdash;description from the publisher (translated)<br/><br/>&Scaron;koda kouzla, kter&eacute; padne vedle je deckbuildingov&aacute; karetn&iacute; hra pro dva hr&aacute;če.

Kouzla, bytosti a obranu. Kouzla představuj&iacute; jednor&aacute;zov&yacute; efekt, kter&yacute; se realizuje ihned a samotn&aacute; karta pot&eacute; jde na odhazovac&iacute; bal&iacute;ček.

Z&aacute;lež&iacute; přitom na pořad&iacute; vyložen&yacute;ch karet, protože karty uprostřed řady jsou chr&aacute;něny těmi na kraji.<br/><br/>Ve hře je celkově velk&eacute; množstv&iacute; unik&aacute;tn&iacute;ch karet, jejichž efekt se neopakuje. Každ&aacute; partie proto poskytuje nov&eacute; možnosti a kombinace jednotliv&yacute;ch hern&iacute;ch efektů. Svoj&iacute; hern&iacute; strategii proto mus&iacute;te přizpůsobit tak&eacute; tomu, co lze pr&aacute;vě nakupovat v čarodějnick&eacute;m obchodě. Kromě karet jsou ve hře tak&eacute; 3 druhy žetonů a krystaly, představuj&iacute;c&iacute; efekt zmrazen&iacute;.

        "description": "Cozy Oaks is a quiet yet humble little village off the Coast. Though the land that surrounds Cozy Oaks is breath-taking, the village itself needs a bit of work. Mayor Williams had an idea that could bring business back into this little town -- Restore the farmlands! Help wanted signs were posted on every corner and as luck would have it, you have taken interest. However, it appears that you have competition.<br/><br/>The Mayor is willing to give each of you 3 years, during which, you will need to grow crops, care for animals, mine for ores, craft new equipment, and do the occasional fishing. If you have the most Star Points at the end of the 3 years, you will be deemed the official Farmer of Cozy Oaks!<br/><br/>Cozy Oaks is unique in that it uses a hand of cards, called Skills, in a very clever way. Each farmer has 10 Skills in their hand, and most Skills will cost time. The player must discard Skills from their hand in order to satisfy this cost, giving the player less decisions for future turns. As the seasons and years pass, players will be upgrading their Skills. And just like life, the more interest you have in a Skill, the more time it takes up in your day. Players will need to upgrade wisely. The only way to retrieve the played and discarded Skills is for the player to Sleep. This allows the player to regain all of their cards back. Each decision is crucial, from playing certain Skills and when to spend time on other things.<br/><br/>GAME SUMMARY<br/><br/>Cozy Oaks is played over 3 Years with each year split into 4 Seasons: Spring, Summer, Fall, and Winter for a total of 12 rounds. Each player moves at their own pace. This means that one player may be on Year 2 Spring while the other player is still on Year 1 Fall. The goal in Cozy Oaks is to have the most Star Points at the end of the game. To achieve this, players must play Skill cards to work on their farms or visit locations in town. Players will need to manage their resources and time wisely.<br/><br/>Each player will begin the game with all ten Level 1 Skill cards in their hand. They will set their Level 2 and Level 3 decks aside for now. Each of the Level 2 and 3 decks can be looked through at any time.<br/><br/>PLAYER'S TURN<br/><br/>1) The player MUST choose a Skill card from their hand to play.<br/><br/>2) Be sure to pay for the Time Cost, if any.<br/><br/>3) The chosen Skill card is placed face up on the table in front of the player.<br/><br/>3a) Cards that were discarded for paying the Time Cost are placed face down and sideways next to the played Skill card.<br/><br/>3b) Be sure to keep the &ldquo;Played Skill&rdquo; pile separate from the <br/>&ldquo;Discarded Time&rdquo; pile.<br/><br/>3c) Cards that have been played or discarded remain on the table until the player plays their Sleep Skill in which all cards will be returned to their hand.<br/><br/>4) The player then performs the Skill card&rsquo;s effect.<br/><br/>5) After the player has completed their Skill, it is then the other player&rsquo;s turn.<br/><br/>-description from designer<br/><br/>",

        "description": "Feel the thrill of racing like never before with DRIFT, the next level in tabletop racing games for 2-4 players, featuring the exciting world of drift racing!<br/><br/>Unlike most other racing games, DRIFT simulates the feeling of driving a car using a completely innovative movement mechanic called the TrajecTile system.<br/><br/>On a player&rsquo;s turn, they use a uniquely shaped set of tiles, TrajecTiles, to plot their car&rsquo;s movement on the track. The tiles represent the gears of a car, 1 through 5. The higher the gear, the further the distance the car moves. The special shapes at the ends of the tile mean that each tile can pivot in the previous tile to simulate steering. The lower the gear tile played, the further it is able to pivot in the previous tile. So, in first gear, although the car is not moving very far, it has the most maneuverability, while in 5th gear, the car is moving quite far but has the least maneuverability.<br/><br/>Five tiles are played each turn, one after the other, and players must chain through the gears like in a real car. Each tile must be followed by a tile that is either the same gear, or one gear higher or lower than the previous tile. So, a 3rd gear tile can be followed by a 2nd, 3rd or 4th gear tile, but not a 1st or 5th.  This has the effect of simulating different handling characteristics at various speeds and, as the tiles must be chained together, simulates acceleration and braking as well. Once 5 tiles have been played, their car is moved to the end of the last tile and the next player takes their turn.<br/><br/>There are two special types of tiles in the game and it&rsquo;s here that drifting comes into play. The first is a handbrake tile, which is used to start a car drifting. A normal gear tile cannot fit into a handbrake tile. A handbrake tile must be followed by one or more drift tiles. The unique shape of a drift tile means that they fit into the corner of a previously placed tile. They can be pivoted in a previous tile, like a normal tile but, if rotated all the way, may also be &ldquo;slid out&rdquo; along their flat side to &ldquo;feather&rdquo; the drift.<br/><br/>Drifting, if done in special Drift Zones around the corners of the track, will earn players Edge Points. These points can be used on subsequent turns to break certain rules of the game. For instance, Edge Points can be spent to &ldquo;Powershift&rdquo;, allowing players to skip up and down gears. i.e. Jumping straight from 1st up to 5th gear or vice versa.<br/><br/>There are, of course, more rules to the game but that should be enough to give you an idea of how the TrajecTile system works.<br/><br/>In addition to a full set of TrajecTiles, DRIFT features 4 highly detailed plastic car miniatures and a set of modular track sections for unlimited replayability as well as player boards with gearshifts to track player&rsquo;s Edge Points and gears from turn to turn. A set of cards to track race positions and reference cards for the various &ldquo;special maneuvers&rdquo; that players can purchase with Edge Points earned through drifting are also included along with sand timers to time the players turns.<br/><br/>&mdash;description from the publisher<br/><br/>",

Instead, players must guess how the active player thinks.<br/><br/>Features:<br/>&bull; No &ldquo;pandering&rdquo; to a judge; More strategy and getting to know other players<br/>&bull; Short game play (but can be extended)<br/>&bull; Great artwork (not just &ldquo;black text on white cards&rdquo;)<br/>&bull; Inclusive (&ldquo;punching up&rdquo;)<br/>&bull; Easy to learn<br/><br/>The active player, or &ldquo;panda&rdquo; gets 4 cards which they secretly rank 1-4 in order of preference. At the same time, the other players must guess how the panda will rank their cards. For each card matched, the player gets a point. At the end of one round, the player with the most points wins!<br/><br/>",

Players may choose to play a single battle, play a full mission with multiple waypoints, battle for control of a portion of a country, or play a full-scale war that may last weeks!<br/><br/>You will select your air, ground, and pod armament before the mission, as well as extra fuel that might just get you home after a tense battle with lots of afterburner. You may fly with wingmen and elements that are randomly generated based on your current command and trust ranks - the better and more trusted you become, the better pilots will fly with you!<br/><br/>The player will create their alter-ego pilot from a detailed pilot-creation system, and through involved tactical battles featuring variable, cunning enemy bogeys, detailed integrated air defense modeling, random ground targets, and the freedom of choosing from over 24 different actions per game 'impulse', you will make the tactical decisions that affect each turn. With limited help from AWACS, you must uncover the battlefield - detect initially unknown 'blips', track, lock and destroy hostile air and ground targets - before they detect and kill you!<br/><br/>No two battles, missions, or encounters are ever the same. Luck is a factor, as in the real battlefield, but skill and sound tactical decisions will always take precedence in the end of Falcon Ace.<br/><br/>Will your pilot change the face of the war... or even live to see the end of it?<br/><br/>",

        "description": "Grey Storm, Red Steel is a set of miniatures rules for small-unit tactical combat on the Eastern Front in World War 2. The scale of the game is a 1:1 representation of men and equipment. Time scale is one game turn equals 2 and a half minutes; ground scale is 1 inch equals 10 meters. The miniatures are mounted in multiples on bases that represent rifle teams (3-4 figures), light machine gun teams (2 figures), leaders (1 figure) and weapons teams (2-4 figures depending on the weapon). Tanks and vehicles are mounted singly. Infantry units are made up of two or more rifle teams and zero to two light machine gun teams.<br/><br/>The rules work very well for representing actions on a platoon or company scale. The rules are best for infantry actions. The rules for tanks are not very detailed: one die roll to see if a hit is made, another for the result based on a comparison of the penetrative ability of gun firing with the overall armor quality of the target. However, they tend to give as good an end result as more complex rules. Anti-tank weapons range from the PzB38/39 and PTRD AT rifles to massive 128mm and 152mm AT guns.<br/><br/>GSRS provides rules for hidden set up, pre-battle recon, weather, command control, and target location that can be used to make challenging game scenarios. There are also some &quot;chrome&quot; rules for things like Panzer Aces, Heroes of the Soviet Union, and civilians in the combat zone. The rules also cover the use of cavalry and air support.<br/><br/>The rules includes a lot of information about unit organization, AFV data, and aircraft data. There is also a section detailing the differences between Soviet and German tactics and capabilities.<br/><br/>GSRS is a somewhat obscure and underrated set of miniatures rules that provides a great deal of flavor and compares very well to tactical boardgames like Squad Leader, ASL, and the Advanced Tobruk (ATS) series.<br/><br/>",

If the corresponding stone was already removed from play (see below) the player may choose to either move the stone with the next higher or the next lower number available.<br/><br/>In his move a player may move the stone one field horicontally, vertically or diagonally towards the diagonally opposite corner. It is not allowed to move backwards.<br/><br/>If a player ends his move on a field occupied by another stone, be it one of the team partner, opponent or one of his own stones, then this stone is removed from play.<br/><br/>In the 4 players version, the two opposite players build a team each. The team that first occupies the diagonally opposite corner field with a playing piece wins. A team loses if one of the players has no more playing pieces left on the board.<br/><br/>In the 3 players version, the player surrounded by two other players plays a solo against the two other players.

Codenamed Operation Uranus, this offensive saw massive thrusts both to the North and South the city itself. Utilizing vast reserves of men and armor that the Germans where unaware of, these two thrusts penetrated deep behind Axis lines causing the German 6th Army to become pinched off, encircled and ultimately doomed. This simulation offers players two scenarios; Firstly the initial stages of Operation Uranus demonstrating the first chaotic days of the Soviet assault, Secondly there is a scenario simulating the ensuing efforts of the Germans to relieve the pocket whilst the Soviets strive to collapse it.<br/><br/>Game Components:<br/><br/>- Map board <br/>- Sheet of Counters <br/>- Game Markers<br/>- Rules Booklet<br/>- Scenario Leaflet<br/>- Player Aid Sheet<br/>- One 6 sided die<br/><br/>",

        "description": "(from publishers' website)<br/><br/>Following a series of contentious elections in which both sides accused the other of support from outside the country, the Ukraine began to fracture.   What started as competing protest marches in the streets rapidly escalated into a shooting war between the different factions.   When the President of the Ukraine finally ordered the Army to restore order, several units revolted, and the President appealed to NATO for assistance.<br/><br/>Ignoring Russian warnings against intervening, NATO provided a small UK-led force, which the Russians countered with a reinforced mechanized corps, plus reinforcements from their Belorussian allies.   The US sent their available forces to the Polish frontier, hoping that their deterrent effect would stabilize the situation.<br/><br/>The Ukrainian &quot;Interventionists&quot; (so named for their favorability toward Russian &quot;intervention&quot;) had organized their own fighting force around the two mechanized brigades (and assorted smaller units) that mutinied against the national command.   Russian operatives assisted in arming and organizing the &quot;101 Brigade&quot; from provinces near the border; other partisans throughout the Ukraine also took up arms on the Interventionist side.<br/><br/>The Ukrainian government incorporated their volunteers into the standing army, hoping to avoid any public relations backlash from having irregular forces on the battlefield, as they attempted to paint the conflict as a civil war in which the Russians were meddling and NATO were invited peacekeepers.<br/>The first battles were joined near Lvov, as the Interventionists bypassed Kiev and pushed as far west as possible, hoping to prevent the NATO forces from establishing a bridgehead in the Ukraine. Russian and Belorussian reinforcements arrived from the north to try and flank the existing Ukrainian national forces before NATO could join the fight. The Americans were moving through Poland, but had concerns about the security of their supply lines.<br/><br/>The Next Wars series brings battalion-level modern shooting wars to your tabletop. Combat units must synchronize attacks and defenses to maximize their collective combat power. Headquarters units coordinate actions on the battlefield and support battalions maintain supply lines.<br/><br/>Civilians are a fact of life on the modern battlefield, and they are present in The Next Wars. Neutral and benign, local civilians may come to support one faction or another based on the behavior of the forces of the battlefield.<br/><br/>Headquarters units also enable players to deploy command cards that allow give units special actions or bonuses on the battlefield. Simulating the staff planning process, the mission cards allow units to prepare and rehearse certain missions for later execution.<br/><br/>The Next Wars is scaled at 10km/hex, with 12-hour turns. Units are battalions, headquarters, and specialty companies.<br/><br/>Next Wars I: Orange Crush will ship in a solid box with over 200 counters, a gorgeous map from Olivier Revenu, a rulebook and scenario book, players references, and 2 decks of command cards.<br/><br/>",

None Shall Pass! is a set of wargame rules which recreate the glory and atmosphere of early Eighteenth Century battles, hopefully without the accompanying blood and tears. The tactics of the period make it as fascinating as chess, with a much greater number of variations. This time in history is easy to conjure up in the popular imagination. You can put yourself at the head of the French Mousquetaires of the Maison du Roi, they who were made famous by Alexandre Dumas, and lead the charge, emulating the Three Musketeers; rally your grenadiers for one last stand; try out new fangled inventions like cannon with three barrels; join the Swedes in their valiant attempts against the rising star of the east, Russia, or be particularly sad and play uplifting marching music when your line of toy soldiers start their main advance (yes, alright, it was me who did that, caused a laugh anyway!). In short, you can let your imagination run wild, while retaining the odd lingering thought that this could all have really happened.....<br/><br/>The game is designed to be played on a flat surface at least 3' by 4' in size. This is covered with terrain features such as hills and villages to represent a model battlefield, over which model figures are used as chess pieces. These figures are placed together on card bases, which are the standard playing piece in the game. If you don't yet possess any such figures or terrain, you could use just card counters to start with, replacing them with model later. However, we do urge you to get some models, as the look of the thing is half the fun of wargaming.<br/><br/>The only other thing you require are six-sided dice and a ruler and/or tape measure marked in inches. Apologies to those who are now used to using centimetres and millimetres, but there still some old strongholds left in England where we refuse to do likewise! --<br/><br/>- Description from publisher<br/><br/>Expanded by:<br/><br/>    None Shall Pass!: To Arms!<br/><br/><br/>",

Enforcing this power was the Sassanid army, with its herds of war elephants and its awesome armored cavalry. For four hundred years the Sassanids battled first the Romans and then the Byzantines, until Arab armies fueled by the passion of Islam swept over both old foes.<br/><br/>King of Kings is a new book supplement for the Series: Rome at War (Avalanche Press) family, using the same format as the many books we've published for the Series: Panzer Grenadier (Avalanche) or Series: Great War at Sea (Avalanche Press). It is not playable by itself; pieces and maps from Rome at War II: Fading Legions are required to enjoy all of its scenarios.<br/><br/>But there are also new armies: Palmyra and Parthia fight both Persian and Roman enemies, and there are new units and leaders for Persia and Rome as well. All told there are 88 double-sized and 88 more merely large playing pieces (that's a full sheet and half of another); all of them scorchless, sootless laser-cut little works of art on our new tile-like material. There are also background articles and over a dozen new scenarios.<br/><br/>",

        "description": "This game has 32 cards, each one representing a wild animal, with its name, a photograph, its habitat on a world map, and its value in 5 attributes: Size, Max Speed, Weight, Lifespan, and Danger Lever (the latter from 1 to 10).  There is also a card that just says &quot;Flax&quot;.  And, two rules cards, and a title card that advertises the other versions: Flax Dinosaurs, and Flax Creatures of the Sea.<br/><br/>The Flax basic game is War-like.  All the cards are dealt out, and everyone looks at their top card.  The leading player picks one attribute and reads it out loud (&quot;Okapi, Max Speed 35 mph&quot;.)  Everyone lays their card down and the card with the highest value in that attribute takes the lot; they go to the bottom of the winner's pile and he leads to the next trick.  The &quot;Flax&quot; card wins any trick but only may be used once.  The ultimate winner is the one who gets all the cards.<br/><br/>In the advanced game, players may look at their whole hand.  The leader chooses a card and a category, and only players who can beat it play to the middle.  The one who takes the trick leads next; but the game is won by the player who gets rid of all their cards first.<br/><br/>",

It is the culmination of a vision for a fantasy setting that avoids the normal races derived from the works of Tolkien and the ever-applicable excuse that 'a Wizard did it'. Twilight has a deep and complex history in which creatures and cultures have evolved, each in their own way. The game of Twilight explores this world, beginning in the settlements of the Empire, under constant attack from the vicious Devanu tribes that scrape a living by preying on livestock or unwary travellers. However, this is just the beginning and there is much more to be uncovered, as the world of the Fubarnii themselves is on the brink of change.<br/><br/>",

From the publishers website:<br/><br/>The H&uuml;rtgen Forest was the site of America's most costly European battle of World War Two. Within its fifty square miles the US suffered more casualties than anywhere else. The H&uuml;rtgen Forest was a densely packed hell of tree-bursting artillery and machinegun fire. It was a trap where the infantrymen of the Allied First Army fool heartedly walked into. Virtually unsupported by armor and artillery, the numerically superior American forces would dash themselves against the hardened defenses of Hitler&rsquo;s West Wall.<br/><br/>The Big Hurt is a supplement for NUTS! - 2nd Edition. Although intended to be played from the American side, The Big Hurt play's just as well from the German side. The Big Hurt can be played solo, cooperatively with all players on the same side or head-to-head.<br/>Packed with 21 linked scenarios, this book covers a variety of small-unit and medium sized actions through the four months of the H&uuml;rtgen meat grinder.<br/>Track down German infiltrators. Raid an enemy outpost. Capture a dam. It&rsquo;s all up to you.<br/><br/>",

Lee. There are many generals and specialized units to choose from.<br/><br/>Command Combat not only puts you in the general's seat, but also gives a sense of how difficult it is to control an army. Players only have control over the generals they are playing. All other units are restricted to a color coded group of orders that are given to them, and can only break out of those restrictions when given new orders. This, and other specialized rules give the game a more realistic flavor, and helps the players understand why certain battles went the directions they did.<br/><br/>Put on the general's uniform and lead your men to victory in the most dynamic struggle in American history.<br/><br/>",

        "description": "The Beckoners are two minions that expand the tactical options for the Neverborn. They are particularly suitable to be added to the Dark Debts crew.<br/><br/>From the Malifaux Tactica Wiki page:<br/>The Beckoner is the Rotten Belle of Lynch's crew, and is just as essential to him as the Belles are to Seamus. They also hold the dubious honor of being the first ladies of the night in the game that are not zombies.<br/><br/>Beckoners are control pieces and function to pull enemy models into your crew and spread the Brilliance characteristic at range. They have a gun, Honeyed Words, with a moderate range that attacks Wp instead of Df and ignores cover. Models damaged by this attack receive the Brilliance characteristic. Their gun also has a highly useful trigger, First Taste's Free. This trigger reduces a target's Wp or Df by 1 and is cumulative. Additionally, the debuff does not end during the Closing Phase, but rather last's until the Beckoner's next activation. This trigger makes them an attractive (pun intended) option for Zoriada or Pandora crews, both of which are heavily dependent on Wp effects. One strategy would be to have the Beckoner activate early in one turn, apply the debuffs, and then activate late the next turn; giving the maximum length of time for the debuffs to be in effect. In addition to the gun they have a melee attack with their nails, which has a low damage spread but automatically provides poison.<br/><br/>Come Hither<br/>This is the bread and butter spell of the Beckoner and the reason for taking them in a Lynch crew. This spell works in a very similar way to Lure, pushing the target toward the Beckoner and then moving her toward it. The twist is that if the target has Brilliance than they push their charge rather than their walk, and the Beckoner has a trigger where if the two models end within melee range of each other, the spell target gains Brilliance. This spell works for your crew on several levels, pulling enemy models away from the safety of their crews or away from objectives, providing Brilliance at range, and if they end the move in melee range of a Beckoner, locking that enemy down with a model that they cannot hit due to Irresistible and Don't Bite the Hand.<br/><br/>Sales Pitch<br/>This spell removes AP from a target's next activation, 1 per mask in the Ca value. This can be used to neuter an opponent's heavy hitter for one turn, but be aware that the spell only effects general AP and targets can still use AP generated by Melee Expert, Casting Expert, etc.<br/><br/>The Party Never Ends<br/>The reason other than Come Hither that the Beckoner gets taken in Lynch crews--all models within 6&quot; of the Beckoner do not lose the Brilliance characteristic at the end of the turn.<br/><br/>The Beckoner's optimal turn occurs when they begin within 12&quot; of a target. The first AP is used to fire their Honeyed Words attack at a target model, wounding it and giving it Brilliance. They then use the (0) action Know My Client to buff their stats versus models with the Brilliance characteristic. Finally they cast Come Hither on the original target (relatively easy with a Ca of 8), pushing that target its charge towards the Beckoner and the rest of your crew.<br/><br/>",

Which of these three goals you need to achieve is determined by the cards you are dealt. The player who is dealt the Ace of Spades will be trying to win 5 tricks playing alone. He/she is known as the High player. The player who is dealt the Two of Diamonds also plays alone and will be trying to go nil (lose every trick). He/she is known as the Low player. The two players who were dealt neither the Ace of Spades nor the Two of Diamonds are on a team for the hand. The team players will score points by preventing the High and Low players from achieving their goals.<br/><br/>Whether you are the High player, Low player, or on the Team will be secret at the beginning of the hand. What goal you are trying to achieve is only revealed through play. Therefore keep a poker face and play smart. Be quiet and unreadable or loud and deceiving.<br/><br/>This is a fun and exciting game for all skill levels. Easy to learn rules and play for beginners.

Set in a compelling world struggling to recover from a legendary apocalypse, it features a modular map that changes every game, an innovative season mechanic, and three ways to score victory points.<br/><br/>The goal of Tymor is to excel in three categories of leadership: Kingdom building, trade, and battle. Throughout the game, players will dispatch their Priests to build and upgrade Settlements, their Merchants to trade in other players' lands, and their Soldiers to claim and defend territory. The player with the most victory points at the end of the game is crowned King or Queen of Tymor.<br/><br/>Tymor's unique season mechanic not only determines the productivity of the players' territory, but their odds of success in battle as well. To prevail in Tymor, you must anticipate the chaotic seasons, outwit your rivals, and build a new kingdom of legend, just as the long dark of the world seems to be lifting at last.<br/><br/>",

In Poland, the unstoppable tide of the Red Army sweeps across the Vistula river and strikes for the Oder, beyond which lies the ultimate objective - Berlin, and the final bitter battles of the Second World War in Europe.<br/><br/>BACKGROUND<br/>A general history of the war from Germany's borders to the streets of Cologne, Konigsberg, Bremen and Berlin, covering the period from January 1945 to the ultimate defeat of the Third Reich in May.<br/><br/>ARMY LISTS<br/>Four army lists designed to play with the character of the principal combatants: German 'Defenders of the Reich', to create the ad hoc battlegroups thrown to fight the invasion. These scratch units, mixing a few veteran survivors with Volksturm and armed civilians, must face the power of Russian, British and American armoured spearheads as they drive ever deeper into Germany.<br/><br/>Also game data for all the late war tanks, guns and equipment.<br/><br/>SPECIAL RULES<br/>New special rules to adapt core Battlegroup game to the battlefields of 1945. The rules recreate the desperate last stand nature of much of the fighting in 1945 whilst retaining game balance, despite the German Army's collapsing morale. Special rules include a new battle counters set as well as new innovations like jet fighters and infra-red sights.<br/><br/>SCENARIOS<br/>Four new general scenarios, including an 'Urban Assault' and a mini-campaign 'Breakthrough to Berlin', of six linked historical refights set on the Seelow Heights.<br/><br/>",

        "description": "A deceptively simple racing game with the possibility of high levels of meanness and co-operation during each brief race. Players sequentially play one of their cards to move. The opening hand is 4x1, 4x2, 4x3, 3x3, 2x5, 1x7, which is enough to get you only halfway around the circuit. If the space you move to is occupied by other cyclists, you gain a jump move of the card you played multiplied by the number of other cyclists in the space. You only get a bonus move from the first space you move to.<br/><br/>And that&rsquo;s it! There are 2 sprint lines at one and two thirds distances, and 2 special spaces (miss your next turn, exchange your hand for a set from the replacement deck, which can re-energise a cyclist who&rsquo;s burnt his best cards) but the beauty of the game is in the movement mechanism. Because of the necessity to get bonus moves every turn you have to stay with the pack while using mid-value cards. Usually there&rsquo;s a few turns of this, then there&rsquo;s a slight increase in speed and suddenly someone is playing their 7 card to try to get back to the pack.<br/><br/>",

        "description": "The Seven Years War: Frederick's Gamble (7YW:FG) is a wonderful wargame based on the innovative and still ever popular card driven game engine from Designer Mark McLaughlin: The Napoleonic Wars (TNW). If you&rsquo;re familiar with TNW or its successor games, Wellington and/or Kutuzov; you&rsquo;ll have little difficulty getting into enjoying this debut Game Design effort by Greg Ticer with game Development by Fred Schachter.<br/><br/>The game&rsquo;s title stems from Frederick the Great, King of Prussia&rsquo;s 1756 land grab of the independent central European State of Saxony, right on his arch-rival Imperial Austria&rsquo;s doorstep. Frederick &ldquo;gambled&rdquo; he could get away with this annexation without triggering a general European War. He failed, and when Austria was joined by its Ally France (Imperial Camp) and then Prussia's Ally Britain (Coalition<br/>Camp) entered the fray with its mainland interests in  Hanover/Hesse, that European War expanded into one of history&rsquo;s first Global Conflicts.<br/><br/>To reflect the global nature of this conflagration, 7YW:FG has<br/>&ldquo;mini-maps&rdquo; off to the side of the main European theatre: one for North America and two areas of the Indian sub-continent. These maps use a point-to-point map of &ldquo;Duchies&rdquo; similar to TNW. An abstract &ldquo;Naval Control Track&rdquo; accommodates the war on the waters so players can concentrate on the exciting action ashore.<br/><br/>There are aspects of the game cards and rules which make this very much an Eighteenth Century, rather than TNW Nineteenth Century, gaming experience.<br/><br/>Mark McLaughlin is the original game system designer (The Napoleonic Wars)<br/><br/>Greg Ticer is the designer of The Seven Years War: Frederick's Gamble<br/><br/>Fred Schachter is the game developer/editor for The Seven Years War: Frederick's Gamble<br/><br/>",

        "description": "18 Card RPG is a semi-cooperative storytelling card game in which players work together to tell a story while individually working to complete their characters' personal goals. Players will choose attributes and goals for their characters from a hand of cards and will then pick from one of two scenarios: &quot;Lab of the Mad Wizard&quot; or &quot;Shopping with Humans.&quot;<br/><br/>On a player's turn, the other players pick one of the active character's attributes and one of her goals and narrate a scene of how that attribute gets the character into trouble while she pursues the goal. Then, the active player must describe the character's attempt to get out of that trouble and meet the selected goal using her other attribute.<br/><br/>For example, let's say your group is playing the scenario &quot;Lab of the Mad Wizard.&quot; Your character has the attributes &quot;Short term memory loss&quot; and &quot;Sarcasm&quot; and the goals of &quot;Needs to burn the place down (even just a little bit)&quot; and &quot;Wants to hurt the feelings of character on right.&quot; The other players might narrate a scene in which you completely forget where you are and what you are doing and then notice a book of matches on the table. You start playing with the matches, which draws the attention of a quivering tower of sentient slime who wants to swallow you and your pretty matches. Now you must narrate your character's effort to get out of this situation using her sarcasm while she tries to meet her goal of burning the place down. Can you manage to crack a sarcastic remark that gets you away from the monster while lighting fire to something?<br/><br/>More importantly, can you tell the tale convincingly enough that the other players will vote for your success? They will decide if your attempt was successful or not and whether or not your goal was met, and they will narrate the results accordingly.<br/><br/>Players WIN who manage to meet the goals of their characters before four rounds have passed, and they celebrate by narrating the fates of their characters freely. Players LOSE whose character's goals are not met before the end of four rounds, and they must narrate the deaths of their characters.<br/><br/>",

        "description": "Inspired by Homer&rsquo;s Iliad, PERGAME is a turn based strategy game that simulates the battle between Achaean and Trojan forces during the Trojan War. Keeping true to the spirit of time and the epic, the game focuses on the actions of heroes and constant involvement of the gods who are always ready to lend a hand to one side or the other. Common soldiers also have a role to play, and initially, their role comes down to guarding their champion. But beware, without a phalanx to support him, even Achilles may be felled by the hand of well-trained rank and file troops. During the battle, each player will try to defeat the opposing army in the field or to push it back to its base &ndash; Troy, or the Achaean camp. And then, when the going gets rough, and the battlements have to be breached, every single warrior is precious. Only good coordination of all elements &ndash; the power of heroes, the much needed support of the soldiers and timely interventions of the gods, can secure victory. Tyche be with you!<br/><br/>",

This kit includes one plastic model of a Spanish fighting ship from the golden age of sail, complete with decals. Model supplied unpainted. Assembly required. This &ldquo;snap fit&rdquo; model can be assembled without glue.<br/><br/>Historical Notes:<br/><br/>Built by the master shipwrights of the Kingdom of Portugal shortly before Portugal was joined with the kingdom of Philip II of Spain in 1580. The Spanish were so impressed by the quality of the Sao Martinho (as the Portuguese called it) that they made it the flagship if their enormous fleet&mdash;the Armada&mdash;and placed it under the fleet&rsquo;s commander-in-chief, the Duke of Medina Sidonia.<br/><br/>Rechristened the San Martin, this enormous fighting ship measured nearly 40 meters long and had a beam of 9 meters. She was armed with 48 heavy guns in two gun decks, as well as many smaller weapons, and a crew of more than 350 sailors. This was a &ldquo;square-rigged&rdquo; vessel with three masts.<br/><br/>The San Martin was critical to the defense of the Armada during its fighting with England, at one point keeping a dozen English ships at bay for an hour on her own. After suffering severe damage at the Battle of Gravelines (July, 1588) in battle with Sir Francis Drake and his Revenge. After escaping from the superior numbers of the English, San Martin was badly damaged in a storm and had to take refuge in Laredo.<br/><br/>",

During an combat, the player with fewer strenght total is allowed to add allies to a General to revert the situation.<br/><br/>Some cards can also be discarded from hand to have an imediatte effect, which can change completely the result of a battle. Effects can vary widely, from keeping some nasty units out of battle, destroy allies, give extra attacks or protect valuable combatants.<br/><br/>The cards used as shields, when destroyed, reinforce the owner's hand and can be played just after. Choosing wisely when forfeit a block, can give you precious resource to win the next battle and  become the new attacker.<br/><br/>With 13 distinct cards per deck, each play allows you a unique experience combining powers and imediate effects.<br/><br/>",

        "description": "Sail and Steam Navies is a PDF set of rules designed for 1/600 scale miniatures, but has information for use with 1/1200 scale miniatures. The period covered is 1840 to 1880 when most warships were equipped with sails as well as steam power. The basic rules are 40 pages long, with charts, markers/templates, an example of play, and conversion information for 1/1200 scale. The Under Both Flags module is included and adds six scenarios, a scenario generator, and log sheets for the ships. There are over 1000 log sheets representing almost every ship involved in the American Civil War and a number of forts and shore batteries. Sets of 1/1200 scale counters in PDF format are available separately for use instead of miniatures.<br/><br/>Players may fight historical battles using one of the 6 scenarios provided or create their own using the scenario generator. Game length will vary depending on the number of ships used and scenario victory conditions. Most scenarios played at conventions with multiple players last 3 to 5 hours. <br/> The game uses D10s for resolving combat and other actions. Usually you will only need one or two dice but more will be required for most damage checks. D6 dice are used to record momentum for each ship. A player aid and a sheet of markers/templates will need to be printed out for use. As with most miniatures based systems any flat playing surface can be used and a ruler or measuring tape is required for checking range and movement.<br/><br/>The turn sequence is straightforward; it starts with writing speed orders for the turn (how fast the ship will go for the turn), followed by combat (cannon fire, musket fire, boarding/melee), then movement, and finally morale checks and repairs.<br/><br/>",

You will be in competition with several other leading magnates of the 19th century that are all vying to build a controlling influence in the industrial cities of the American Northeast.<br/><br/>Your dice represent the rolling stock of your railroad that you roll and place each turn in various enterprises around the edge of the board. This is the business engine you must use efficiently to get resources and other benefits needed for your expansion. Obtaining more dice is essential and will generate further opportunities for growth.<br/><br/>With enough growth and the strategic placement of your locomotives, you can control several major city stations for additional advantages over your competition. Each station has a unique ability - so chose your path of expansion carefully; but beware, someone may try to take your place.

        "description": "The Battle for Fort Driant marked the end of Patton&rsquo;s campaign in the Lorraine. Following the breakout of the US Third Army from Normandy and its drive across France, Patton&rsquo;s forces had fought hard and victoriously. However, by the end of September shortages of fuel and ammunition forced General Dwight D. Eisenhower to order a halt. Those supplies that did get through were diverted to British General Bernard Montgomery&rsquo;s forces to the north for the upcoming Market-Garden offensive. Frustrated, Patton ordered a &ldquo;reconnaissance in force&rdquo; to take Fort Driant, the last German-held position barring Third Army&rsquo;s way to Metz.<br/><br/>Believing the fortress to be held only by rear echelon personnel and demoralized remnants of units that had retreated into its works, Patton felt the position could be easily taken by a reinforced battalion of the 11th Regiment of the 5th US Infantry Division (nicknamed the &ldquo;Red Diamonds&rdquo;), the only unit he could provide sufficient fuel and ammo to continue offensive operations. However, the German garrison was well prepared to resist, with elements of the 17th SS (Kiss My Ass) division nearby for support.<br/><br/>In actuality the US forces attacking Fort Driant would be outnumbered and outgunned. The ten day battle that raged at Fort Driant was marked by bloody and fierce fighting that at times was waged hand-to-hand and both sides calling in &ldquo;final protective fire&rdquo; upon their own positions. In the end the 5th Infantry&rsquo;s &ldquo;blood and guts&rdquo; would not be enough, and Patton would order his only retreat of the war from Fort Driant. Can you do better?<br/><br/>",

As currency to hire and build hunters and bases to your team.  As equipment to help your hunters ready for the hunt.  And as Hunters, bases or artifacts for your team.<br/><br/>Players can take two actions on their turn.  Actions are; draw a card, hire a hunter, build a base, equip a hunter, or kill a vampire.<br/><br/>To hire a hunter, a player discards cards equal to the hunter's level.  Same with building a base.  A player can equip either their own or an opponents hunter.  When equipping an opponents hunter, players will gain extra actions according to the hunter equipped.  To successfully kill a vampire, a player's team must be properly equipped with weapons and hunter types.<br/><br/>The game is a race to kill vampires, with the amount needed to end the game scaling for player count.

        "description": "In Imperium:  From Republic to Empire, players control factions of influential Roman Senators, each with a unique combination of attributes.  Factions gain prestige points by successfully leveraging the strengths of their senators, political opportunities, senatorial influence, and treasuries as they engage in various aspects of Roman politics.  Prestige gained through popularity and success but can be just as easily lost through failures and conviction.  Victory is declared when one senator or faction has gained sufficient prestige as to be crowned the First Emperor of Rome.<br/><br/>However, success will require both competition and cooperation as all factions must work together to ensure the stability of Rome.  Failures of the Senate and unmet public demand will increase civil unrest, leading to revolt.  Excessive war involvement will overextend Rome&rsquo;s military resources.  Spending more funds than what is available will bankrupt the State Treasury.  Any of these situations could ensure the fall of Rome causing all players to lose the game.<br/><br/>The game is played over approximately 10 rounds until a victory condition is met or until all players are defeated by the game.  Each round is made up of six distinct phases:<br/><br/>Election Phase:  <br/>Each player will take turns choosing offices to assign to Senators within their faction.  High Offices include High Consul, Low Consul, and Censor.  Lower offices include Praetor and Proconsul (assigned to govern one of the many provinces of Rome).  Player initiative is based on the overall faction prestige and 'bribes' made to the Assembly.<br/><br/>Senate Phase:  <br/>Factions vote to raise legions, purchase grain subsidies, and deploy legions to war.  The more senators your faction has, the greater your ability to influence these decisions.  Beware&mdash;an &lsquo;Assassin&rsquo; or &lsquo;Mob Incitement&rsquo; card in the hands of a jealous senator played at the appropriate time can severely upset the balance of power.<br/><br/>Republic Phase:  <br/>Senators now perform their duties in positions throughout the Republic.  This may include: Proconsuls hiring auxiliary legions to enhance provincial defenses, Senators in Rome attempting to persuade others to joint their faction, and even certain senators engaging in corruption to gain needed funding.  Rome must also respond to random events such as public demands, barbarian raids, provincial insurrection, and plagues.<br/><br/>War Phase:  <br/>Wars are now resolved.  If victorious, the general returns to Rome with additional prestige and the potential of war spoils.  A stalemate will cause the general to return to Rome having lost prestige due to eroding public confidence.  A defeat will end in death for the general, an increase in public unrest, and the affected province being overrun.  Victorious generals also have the option of &ldquo;crossing the Rubicon&rdquo; to engage in civil war with the Roman State in an attempt to secure an early win.<br/><br/>Trial Phase:  <br/>The Censor will prosecute corruption charges of the Senate.  For each successful conviction, the Censor gains additional prestige while the accused may either lose prestige or (in the case of murder or treason) be executed.<br/><br/>Intersession Phase:  <br/>Because time is the great equalizer--Senators may die randomly of natural causes.  Victory conditions are then checked and the game is reset for the next round of play.<br/><br/>Imperium:  From Republic to Empire was designed to be a simplified, more accessible alternative to Republic of Rome (Avalon Hill, 1990; Valley Games).<br/><br/>Version 2.3.1 was submitted for publication in March 2022.<br/><br/>",

        "description": "Striker! is a set of straightforward rules for playing realistic miniature football (or soccer, depending on your side of the pond) matches on the tabletop. Each match plays just like a wargame using miniatures to represent players. Challenges, passes and shots on goal are resolved by rolling dice. Many strategies and tactics that are employed in a real football match also apply to this game: midfield pressing, tiki taka passing, switches of play, and many more. If you can do it on a football field, Striker! allows you to do it on the tabletop. The game is meant for 2 players, but can also be played in groups or even solo, taking about 90 - 120 minutes to play.<br/><br/>Just like the real game there are red cards, yellow cards, and shots on goal. Each phase of play is broken into stages: the attackers move their players, or pass, or dribble etc, and then the defenders get a phase to counter, and cover the attacking runs. Players move specific distances, just as in a standard wargame. The game lasts 40 phases (20 attacking and 20 defending phases for a half of football) with each phase ending after the defenders finalize their moves, or when a pass goes astray and possession is turned over to the defenders through a tackle or wayward pass.<br/><br/>",

Cretacea is inspired mainly by the great dinosaur documentaries of the late 90&rsquo;s.<br/><br/>This short gaming rule set will allow you to grab some dinosaurs, terrain and be gaming in no time. Cretacea is designed to be used with 1/100th scale dinosaurs (roughly similar to 10mm regimental scale) but you could use any dinosaur toy or model as long as their scale is relative to each other. Bases of the dinosaurs should not exceed their physical dimensions to any particular extent and they should be based individually, even small and tiny dinosaurs. Tokens have been included in this set for every dino listed! Each game lasts about 30-45 minutes and is more about acting on your opportunities than being overly tactical in this way the game often keeps you on your toes<br/><br/>",

        "description": "You..You really are incorruptible, aren't you? You won't kill me out of some misplaced sense of self -righteousness, and I won't kill you because you are to much fun. I think you and I are destined to do this forever? - The Joker<br/><br/>The Joker is one of Batman's oldest and greatest foes. A mirror of the Bat himself, the Joker stands for everything Batman is against. Chaos, disorder and crime without reason.<br/><br/>Possibly one of Batman's greatest failures when the Red Hood fell into a vat of chemicals, the Joker has plagued Batman, his allies and Gotham City ever since.<br/><br/>Nobody knows who he really is and even the Joker himself has told several different origin stories. If he's going to have one, he would prefer it to be multiple choice.<br/><br/>Seeing murder, chaos and his 'dance' with Batman as one big joke, the Joker is one of the most dangerous men Batman has ever faced. Using countless resources including his own Joker Gas, he tries to take down Gotham and 'Batsy' again and again. Only to end up each time in Arkham Asylum.<br/><br/>During one stay in Arkham, the Joker met Dr. Harleen Quinzel. A psychiatrist that developed an obsession with the Joker that led her to become Harley Quinn and follow her 'puddin' on his journey of insanity.<br/><br/>Some of the Jokers worst crimes include paralysing Barbara Gordon / Batgirl and killing Batman's own sidekick Jason Todd / Robin. Batman has sworn not to kill, but can the Joker push him over the edge?<br/><br/>Using a Joker crew in the Batman Miniatures Game is to bring chaos to the table.<br/><br/>A dangerous man in his own right with weapons like a poisoned knife, one shot gun and explosive teeth, the Jokers true strength comes from his ability to change his crews plans at the last minute with the use of Kaos Agent. This means your opponent can never really know what you are going to do until it's too late.<br/><br/>Having Harley Quinn as a Sidekick can help with the mass chaos as she can even change your opponents plans while her True Love for the Joker means she can become very dangerous if her 'puddin' is taken down. Or if you need some muscle instead, Mr Hammer is happy to help.<br/><br/>The Jokers Clown Henchmen are very basic fighters all armed with a range of different weapons. They are easy to take down one by one, but being cheap to hire, there can be enough on the table to pull off any crime. There are also a few Elite Clowns if you want some Henchmen that are a bit more resilient and hit harder.<br/><br/>The Joker crew has access to all sorts of Free Agents to help them out. Killer Croc adds some serious muscle to the crew when it's needed and is quick to move around to where he is needed via the sewers. Scarecrow can help keep the insanity under control while also messing with the opponents plans further by forcing models to activate first.<br/><br/>Overall, the Joker crew is great for anyone to play. Kaos Agent makes it easy on new players while messing with your opponents plans can be fun for more experienced players.<br/><br/>Contains:<br/><br/>4 metal miniatures:<br/>- Joker<br/>- Clown<br/>- Ringmaster<br/>- Contra-Auguste<br/>Stat cards for the characters<br/><br/>",

Two to eight players compete to reach their ultimate goal - The Stage. The path to their ultimate goal is filled with challenges; players must avoid Hard Luck spaces, get past Midnight Robbers, take advantage of Warrahoon cards AND display their knowledge of Trinidad and Tobago Carnival. As unpredictable as it is enjoyable, Santimanitay is a must have for anyone interested in Carnival, board games or just having fun.<br/><br/>WHO&rsquo;S IT FOR?<br/><br/>Santimanitay was conceptualized as a game that captures the spirit and fun of Trinidad and Tobago while preserving important aspects of our history and culture. The game is designed for 2 to 8 players, making it suitable for any situation or occasion, from a quite evening at home to the highlight of a Friday night lime. The ability to choose characters with different attributes can give an advantage to those who may not be as familiar with Trinidad and Tobago&rsquo;s culture and history, making Santimanitay universally enjoyable. From age 8 to 80, choose a character and start the race!<br/><br/>WHY DO IT?<br/><br/>Known as the greatest show on earth, Trinidad and Tobago Carnival is a festival of beauty, colour, and pageantry. All aspects of Carnival have a rich and storied history; music, costuming, performance. As well-known as the festival may be, not many people know in what year the first Panorama was held, or who was the first winner of the International Soca Monarch competition, or even when the Canboulay Riots occurred in Port of Spain. Santimanitay was developed to help share and preserve this knowledge through engaging game play, memorable characters and challenging questions.<br/><br/>",

Charlie Company of the 8th Regiment, 1st Air Cavalry was dispatched to inspect suspicious activity by the NVA north of Fire Base Illingworth. On March 26th they were ambushed by the 1st Battalion of the NVA's 272 Regiment, 9th Infantry Division. Deep in jungle terrain, Charlie Company was cut-off and unable to call-in accurate artillery or air support. The jungle canopy also made impossible any extraction by helicopter. It looked like the Communists were about to wipe-out or capture over 100 US soldiers.<br/><br/>Four kilometers away was Alpha troop of the 11th Armored Cavalry, along with Alpha Company of the 8th Regiment of the 1st Air Cav. Commander John Poindexter, monitoring the increasingly desperate radio messages from Charlie Company wasted no time in ordering his men to &quot;Saddle Up!&quot; in order to rescue their trapped comrades. Busting through jungle and risking ambush, the rescue and battle fought here in March, 1970 rank among the war's most epic and amazing fights.<br/><br/>Fortunate Sons is the companion &ldquo;sister&rdquo; game to Bad Moon Rising: The Battle for Firebase Illingworth. The two games use the same design and scale. Players use a standard deck of playing cards to activate units and resolve some game events, as well as a six-sided die.<br/><br/>",

This means that each spot on the circular track has 2 corresponding actions. The inner disc may also be rotated to change the makeup of the actions for each sector.<br/> Move your player token on the Mothership up to 3 spaces clockwise on the circular action track and take the actions of that space.<br/> The actions include scouting new sites, placing feeder strings onto a site to retrieve Nutrients, and assembling Cargo Tiles from Nutrients and adding the tiles to your saucer to fill up your ship. The requirements for each Cargo Tile is specified at the Foundry Ship, and can be modified during the game. Upgrade your saucer for efficiency, unique abilities, and extra VPs. You can also collect entire sites of different type to get lots of VPs.<br/> Then the turn passes to the player on the left, and this continues until a player fills up their ship with cargo, or one of the other end goals is triggered.<br/><br/>",

        "description": "&quot;1848: Year of Revolution&quot; is a wargame simulation of the series of popular revolts that swept across continental Europe in that year. The revolutionaries involved wanted to overthrow the reactionary and repressive regimes that had been in power since the Treaty of Vienna in 1815. Prince Metternich of Austria, &lsquo;the coachman of Europe,&rsquo; had kept order and stifled change for over 30 years with his continent-wide system of police spies and divisive diplomacy. The revolts had a number of contributing causes: nationalism; liberalism; the emerging radical doctrines of socialism, anarchism, and communism; the changing structure of the economy due to industrialization and urbanization; and even Romanticism. Initially, the rebels succeeded in getting concessions from or even casting out their rulers, but internal dissensions and determined counterrevolutionary reaction erased the gains they had made by the end of 1848.<br/><br/>In the game, 2-4 players (up to three Rebels and one Reactionary) take the role of the leaders of various political forces in different areas of Europe. Generally, the Rebel player or players' objective is to spread revolt and seize power while the Reactionary player's objective is to retain power.<br/><br/>140 double-sided counters, 11&times;17&Prime; area-movement map of Europe, abstract troop and time/action scale.<br/><br/>Designed 1997, as an act of creative procrastination while battling writer&rsquo;s block on finishing an article for &quot;Strategy and Tactics&quot; magazine on the event.

It was originally designed to fit inside a standard Alto Mint Tin.<br/><br/>Using two standard ten-sided dice (2d10), this cracking little game helps to recreate all the ﬂow and jargon of a real football match, with substitutions, injuries, free kicks, corners, penalties, last-ditch saves, formation changes, players getting sent oﬀ and own goals too!<br/><br/>Players compare team strengths in three outfield areas (Defence, Midfield, and Attack) to determine a basic modifier to the Target/Progress Roll and then roll the dice to try and move the ball between their outfield areas in an eﬀort to score goals.<br/><br/>Included are playable Bonus Action Cards for each team, Event Cards that are drawn every time a Progress Roll fails (allowing formation changes, introducing injuries, providing second chances, adding injury time and tactical changes, etc), and an Xtreme Event deck that allows for those extra special moments when things go amazingly good, or disastrously bad!<br/><br/>If you download and play this game, please do leave any comments/feedback about your experiences &mdash; several players have asked if I'm planning a larger, full-card version, with more options and events, varied time segments and tighter controls, and this is certainly something I might be taking a look at over the next few months... Others have asked if I'm planning any expansions with real football player and team names, and to be honest I'd encourage anyone who wants to do this to freely supply replacement team/player ratings if they prefer. Better yet, upload and share them here!<br/><br/>Thanks in advance for taking the time to download and try it!<br/><br/>If you get to play it, please do rate it and add a comment -- all feedback is appreciated.<br/><br/>",

Spells are organized into seven different schools of magic, such as Transfiguration, Charms, Divination, etc. There are over a thousand possible combinations to create your deck with!<br/><br/>You have two resources to manage, stamina which represents your health, and power which is the magical energy that allows you to cast spells. Each spell has a range of power that you can use to cast it, such that it has a greater effect the more power you use.<br/><br/>You will also have access to the two special action cards; Focus and Counterspell. Focus will bring you back to full power, while counterspell will prevent your opponent&rsquo;s spell from have an effect, causing them to waste the power they used to cast it. Counterspell costs a bit of your own stamina however, and that cost increases the more you use it! Knowing when to focus, and when to counterspell is the key to victory!<br/><br/>The game is played with a simultaneous action mechanic. Each round, both players secretly choose a card from their hand to play, and secretly set a special dial to show how much power they are using with their card. Both players reveal their cards and dials at the same time. Spells that use less power will go before spells that use more.<br/><br/>You will play best two out of three matches. As the game progresses, you will learn more about the cards in your opponent&rsquo;s hand, and be able to better guess when to counterspell and stop them! No matter how many powerful spells you bring a wizard duel, the key to victory is understanding your opponent!<br/><br/>-description from designer<br/><br/>",

        "description": "Due to the stalemate at Brunete the Republicans launched a new offensive further east in Aragon Province. The new offensive would again be spearheaded by the International Brigades by the Army of the East. The goal was to break through the Nationalist lines and take the key city of Zaragosa. Success here would compel the Nationalists to withdraw, bringing relief to the city of Madrid and demonstrating the Republican cause could still win the civil war. The Nationalists had stripped this portion of the front of troops, with only three divisions holding the line. Despite their superiority in men and tanks, as well as the commitment of nearly all of the Republican air force to the offensive, the Nationalists grimly held to their positions and were able to disrupt the Republican attack. The fighting was particularly hard at Belchite, where fighting degenerated into a house-to-house slugfest that left the city in ruins. By the start of September the Nationalists had brought up reinforcements and gained air superiority. However, the Republican&rsquo;s determination managed to hold off the Nationalist counter-offensive, and by the 6th a stalemate in the war returned here.<br/><br/>Can you do as well or better than your historical counterparts?<br/><br/>Each copy of Courageous Tragedy is composed of the following:<br/><br/>&bull;    Two 11 by 17 hex map sheets<br/>&bull;    81 un-mounted, double-sided counters<br/>&bull;    8 pages of rules<br/><br/>As with the other Battles of the Spanish Civil War Series (on Teruel and Brunete), players use a standard deck of playing cards to activate their units and determine some game events.

Battle Hymn is the new brigade-level system based upon the latest research into Civil War combat. This new entry introduces a new solitaire system to the series and an extension map for Gettysburg (Volume One) for a complete alternative history of the entire battle. Designed by Charles S. Roberts Award-winning designer Eric Lee Smith.<br/><br/>Shiloh: The First Great Battle depicts the two-day battle of Shiloh. The Confederate army surprises the Union forces of General Grant and a fierce battle blazes for two days, with first the Confederate on the offensive and then the Union turning to the attack on the second day. Shiloh shocked to the nation. Left dead or injured were more men than in all of America&rsquo;s previous wars combined. The game includes four scenarios.<br/><br/>Bentonville: The Last Great Battle simulates the final major battle of the war. Sherman is marching through North Carolina when a surprise attack by the much-weakened Army of Tennessee catches one wing of the US army exposed. The first day ends in a bloody stalemate, and continues on for two more days. Can the Confederates escape? This game has both two-player and solitaire scenarios, and introduces an innovative new solitaire system to the game series.<br/><br/>Bonus One&mdash;Gettysburg &rsquo;62: No Lost Orders depicts an alternative history&mdash;the Confederates do not lose their orders for the 1862 invasion, Antietam never happens, and Jeb Stuart&rsquo;s cavalry begins the battle of Gettysburg with a major engagement south of the Round Tops. The battle grows as a Union corps arrives to face off with Heth&rsquo;s Division.<br/><br/>Bonus Two&mdash;the Gettysburg extension map attaches to Gettysburg: The Tide Turns making for a complete alternative history of the entire battle. Plus, a new scenario explores the alternative that Pickett&rsquo;s Charge never happens; instead the Confederates drive south around the Round Tops on their way to Baltimore.<br/><br/>&mdash;description from the publisher<br/><br/>",

        "description": "Principle Dilemma - The righteous pursuit through moral combat.<br/><br/>This intellectual card-based board game gives each player the opportunity to use their creative thinking and moral compass to delve deeper into their own minds, thoughts and discomforts as well as those of their opponents. Players will expand their minds by analyzing some realistic and  some not so realistic situations where one is forced to make a moral choice. Some choices may be easy while others may be much more difficult.  Players who engage honestly with an open mind may learn some things about their opponents as well as themselves as they challenge each other in a battle of strategic persuasion.<br/><br/>For each round, one person plays the role of the hero while the others play as the tricksters. The hero is faced with a dilemma and must make a moral decision. The tricksters must make use of their cards and their creative mindset to attempt to alter the dilemma in such a way that will cause the hero to change their mind. Those tricksters who can change the hero&rsquo;s mind score a point for the round. The winner of Principle Dilemma is the one who scores the most points in a predetermined number of rounds, or is the first to score a predetermined number of points.<br/><br/>This party game for thinkers can be played seriously or just for fun. Either way, it shatters the ice in a meaningful way by providing a stage for authentic and exciting conversation between friends and strangers alike. When the stakes are lifted and the variations eccentric, there is freedom to explore outside the box.<br/><br/>&mdash;description from the designer<br/><br/>",

        "description": "Failure on the Tugela covers the attempts by the British to relieve Ladysmith following the failure at Colenso on the 15th December 1899. These attempts took place during the months on January and February 1900, most famously at Spion Kop.<br/><br/>The core game will be the same as Redvers Reverse utilizing the same scale for the map and counters. To reiterate the games mechanics -  it is at Battalion and Battery level with emphasis upon the leadership of the British at a Brigade level for Infantry and at Divisional level for the Cavalry.  The key feature of the game is to present the player with the problems and difficulties that Buller himself faced.<br/><br/>However there are key differences. Most notably is the fact that a game system that previously covered nothing more than a few hours will now cover a number of weeks. This is achieved by giving the player the opportunity to make a maximum of three breakthrough attempts in order to reach Ladysmith. This fits with the historical attempts on the Tabanyana Heights, Spion Kop and Val Krantz.  Each breakthrough attempt, and its outcome, will have an impact on subsequent attempts.  The player will have a series of predetermined target areas, at three different levels for each attempt. The level of success will determine the starting level  of the Boer Confidence track for the next attempt. The more casualties inflicted the more diluted will be the Boer variable strength marker pool. However push too far and you own strength levels will be compromised with the increased likelihood of losing good quality leaders for the next breakthrough attempt. For each attempt you can push on into a second day but this is not without risk and will require you to reach a higher level of target area. Failure to reach any of the harder targets may well improve, rather than decrease Boer confidence levels.<br/><br/>It would not be a British Empire campaign without command confusion and there is plenty of that here. Events cover the situation where, historically, there were three people who believed they were in command during the attempt to secure Spion Kop. In addition whilst Warren is in charge for the first, and probably the second attempt, he must achieve a level of success otherwise he is demoted and either Buller or Clery take charge. If Warren or Clery are in command then Events exist where Buller meddles and further confusion occurs.<br/>There are four possible breakthrough scenarios, the three historical ones and Brakfortein Ridge. You determine which you undertake by rolling on a table; which attempts you have already undertaken and the level of success achieved, will influence where the next attempt is. It is possible that you could undertake an attempt against the same location twice (but not all three times).<br/><br/>One change in the  game map is that certain areas are designated &lsquo;Peak areas&rsquo; and one area (Spion Kop) is split into three &lsquo;Peak areas&rsquo;.  Peak areas improve Fire distances for artillery, are more vulnerable for defending Infantry (if not in an emplacement) and will be occupied by Boer units if vacant and adjacent to them.<br/><br/>In addition they provide the reasoning behind employing a number of additional Event counters.<br/>Tugela has Event counts, amongst others, for Murderous fire (basically free shots at units adjacent to both Infantry and Artillery in a Peak area),  British Surrender, Boer Loss of Nerve, Boer Inspired Leadership and  Acton homes (will explain as testing progresses).<br/><br/>Given some of the steep slopes certain movements will require the unit to stay put for a turn before moving again. There will be no searching for Drifts in Tugela, unlike Redvers Reverse, as the four main drifts are well known. There will be three Pontoon bridges which can be laid under certain conditions. <br/>There are a number of addition battles from the Boer War which lend themselves to the system, particularly those concerning the relief of Kimberley. In addition the Natal campaign has more to offer notably the eventual success at Tugela Heights and the siege of Ladysmith itself.<br/><br/>However the third volume of the system will be moving to the Crimean War and the battle of Inkermann. This time, as the British, the player is in a largely defensive roll.<br/>  <br/>&mdash;description from the designer<br/><br/>",

        "description": "Rally Point Volume 16: A World at War 1937-1945 is a set of 10 all new scenarios that are set in World War II. These scenarios were originally scheduled to appear in Schwerpunkt Volume #24. Production of future volumes of Schwerpunkt is on hiatus for the foreseeable future, so the Tampa ASL Group decided to publish them in the pages of Rally Point instead. Each scenario was handmade and play-tested to the high standard players expect from the Tampa ASL Group&rsquo;s fine craftsmen. Each scenario is presented in the Schwerpunkt easy-to-read format on high-quality card stock.<br/><br/>RPT151 Luodian Lament &ndash; LUODIAN, China, 23 August 1937: Nineteen squads from the Chinese 66th Regiment attack to clear the defending 44th Japanese Regiment (11 squads) from the village on boards 10z and 70. This medium-sized 5.5 turn scenario is a tense all infantry action that features Chinese OBA.<br/><br/>RPT152 Shaken Not Stirred &ndash; VILLERS-MAREUIL, France 29 May 1940: Six R35 tanks and seventeen squads conduct a rare French combined arms attack to seize five buildings from twelve defending squads of the German 57th Infantry. This 4.5 turn scenario is set four half boards: 64, 65, 67 and 70.<br/><br/>RPT153 Run Gurkha Run &ndash; ASUN, Malaya, 11 December 1941: The title says it best. A company of Gurkha infantry is forced to withdraw across boards 17 and 72 while being hotly pursued by thirteen squads of the Japanese 11th Infantry Regiment and three supporting Ha-Go tanks. This 5 turn scenario has lots of exciting action that usually culminates in a Banzai charge near the end.<br/><br/>RPT154 Mars Begins &ndash; GREDIANKO, U.S.S.R., 25 November 1942: If you like fighting in the snow, this Eastern Front gem is for you. Twenty Russian squads supported by Lee, KVI and T-34 tanks attack to clear eleven German squads from the buildings on board 3a. This action-packed, 5 turn scenario (Designed by Mike Augustine) features German OBA and Russian rocket artillery.<br/><br/>RPT155 Schutzstaffel Shindig- GRUSCHKI GRAVE, West of Kharkov, Ukraine, U.S.S.R. 31 August 1943: In this 5.5 turn, medium-sized scenario, a company of ten Russian tanks (T-34s and a KV-2) from the 2nd Tank Corps attacks with infantry riders to clear two StuGs and two PzIVF2s supported by panzer-grenadiers of the 5th SS Panzer Division &ldquo;Wiking&rdquo; from the hills overlooking the roads on boards 18 and 61. This tank battle will test your nerves and require you to use all your tank fighting skills.<br/><br/>RPT156 Wiking Rescue- ZERCZYCE, and STACJA-NURZEC, Poland, 22 July 1944: Veteran Tampa ASL Group member, &ldquo;Mountain Man&rdquo; Dave Brown makes his designing debut with this unique scenario in which both sides get to attack. A full SS panzer-grenadier company mounted in halftracks and supported by Panther tanks from the 5th SS Panzer Division &ldquo;Wiking&rdquo; attacks to clear a farmstead and relieve the besieged Penal Battalion 560. Will the fifteen Russian squads and six SU-76ms from the 44th Rifle Division overrun their village before help arrives? This is an action-packed, 5.5 turn, scenario that uses boards 9a, 16 and 43.<br/><br/>RPT157 Ozarks and Frundsbergers &ndash; RURDORF, Germany, 2 December 1944: A company of American infantry from the 102nd &ldquo;Ozark&rdquo; Infantry Division with five supporting Sherman tanks tries to out-flank and cut off the retreat of seven squads, an SPW251/22 and a PSW 234/3 from the 10th SS Panzer Division &ldquo;Frundsberg&rdquo;. This fast playing, 5 turn scenario is set on boards 53 and 72.<br/><br/>RPT158 Hungarian Hetzers &ndash; EBED, Upper Hungary, 6 January 1945: Eight Russian squads, four T-34s and an SU-85 from the 22nd Guards Tank Brigade attack to clear the village on boards 1a and 9a. Here, the Hungarian Division &ldquo;Szent Laszlo&rdquo; is defending with six squads and three Hetzers, one of which must exit the board. This 4.5 turn scenario is perfect for tournament play and has lots of tense action that is sure to go down to the last CC Phase.<br/><br/>RPT159 Lesson Learned in Lessin &ndash; LESSIN, West Prussia, 25 January 1945: The Soviet 9th Tank Corps attacks with a company of infantry, two IS-2s and four T-34/85s to clear elements of the 7th Panzer Division from buildings along a frozen lake. Hidden JgPz IV/70s on the opposite shore pour deadly flanking fire upon the attacking Russians, making this an exciting Eastern Front action in the snow. Mike Augustine designed this 5.5 turn scenario that uses boards 75 and 79.<br/><br/>RPT160 Willie und Fritz &ndash; MUSKAU, Poland, 10 March 1945: Elements of the Soviet 112th Rifle Division (17 squads) with two ISU 122s and four IS-2s execute a two-pronged attack to seize five buildings. Fallschirm Grenadier Regiment Hermann G&ouml;ring defends this town with thirteen squads along with three Panthers and must simultaneously prevent the Russians from exiting two AFVs. This 5.5 turn scenario has multiple victory conditions and a unique tactical situation that provides a lot of re-playability. It is set on boards 2, 3b and 79.<br/><br/>",

The Home Marker, a large flat piece, is placed over the player's apartment, townhouse or estate to show which is his home. One of the three long pieces is placed on the Salary Record Board, one on the Rent and Salary Board and one on the Home Marker. The Direction Cards are placed on the board face down. Each player is given $500 and someone is designated as the banker. Each player rolls the die and high player starts. Each player in turn selects an apartment or house and places the Home Marker with the long piece atop on it and pays the bank the rent or lease. each player in turn takes the long piece from atop the Home Marker and places it in the yellow circle marked &quot; Downtown and rolls the die. If a 5 or 6 is rolled the player draws a Direction card and follows the instructions which may mean moving the piece to a specific place and paying an amount to the bank. If a 1, 2 or 4 is rolled, the player moves his playing piece in any direction along the marked street one red dot for each count. The objective is to get the playing piece back to the Home Marker to increase salary. Salaries are collected to amass the funds to purchase the estate and liquidate bank debts.<br/><br/>&mdash;user summary<br/><br/>",

That battered piece of tin is older than any soul living, and most of the buildings and statues across the land besides. The name of the original king who commissioned it has long since passed from memory, just the same as his kingdom. Pah, the only thing that kept it safe during the war is that the bloody thing is nigh on worthless.<br/><br/>But the prestige to win it? Ah, now there&rsquo;s a thing to be sought after, and savoured like a lean joint of venison. To a Chef, the King&rsquo;s Pud is more important than even the Sovereign States, and the rewards twice as lucrative. Usually it&rsquo;s only our own who compete for the cup, Chefs from all over travelling to the holder&rsquo;s demesne to compete. But, now we&rsquo;ve found ourselves in the big leagues, the field is open to all. So, you&rsquo;d bloody well better shape up, girl. I don&rsquo;t intend on letting anyone but our own get their filthy hands on the prize, and I won&rsquo;t be too happy even if another Chef crew does!<br/>                                                               - Wellington, Chef&rsquo;s Guild Team Captain<br/><br/>The Cooks are the fourth of the Minor Guilds to reveal themselves, after the Ratcatchers, Falconers, and Navigators.

Each player may only take this special bonus once regardless of how many of their Nogs are on the supply cards.<br/><br/>This card was not a promotional item and never available as a free giveaway at a convention or with the base game.

Do you: stack one card or balance cards, directly attack others or choose a card just to prevent another from getting it, save it for later or spend now?

        "description": "Above the Clouds! is a set of air-combat miniature wargame rules for fighting large air battles from the late 1930s through the 1970s.<br/><br/>The rules are intended to produce a free-flowing and fast game to represent air combat.  Although air warfare is a very technical form of combat, rules which focus too much on the technical details quickly lose the &quot;feel&quot; of air combat by turning the game into a slow, plodding simulation where seconds of combat time require hours of game time to resolve.<br/><br/>To avoid this, a fairly minimalist approach was taken in the game design.  Individual aircraft have unique capabilities, and pilot skill/experience determines advantages and disadvantages, but the emphasis in the game is rapid execution of turns so that they game moves quickly.<br/><br/>To achieve this, the following concepts guided the game development:<br/><br/>     Each player will typically control 2-4 aircraft<br/>     Minimal plotting, make a quick decision for each aircraft and move on<br/>     Aircraft speeds should matter, but it should not take more than a couple seconds to determine speed changes<br/>     Combat should be decisive and quick to resolve<br/>     Aircraft damage should not be overly detailed -- aircraft will either be fully functional, crippled or destroyed<br/>     It spans the gambit of combat from WW1 through the wars of the late 1930s (Spanish Civil War, 2nd Sino-Japanese War), WW2, and 1950s-1970s (Korean War, Arab-Israeli Wars, Vietnam War)<br/><br/><br/>&mdash;description from the publisher<br/><br/>",

Lead an infantry platoon through random battles, several campaign styles or scenarios of your own design. Track the progress of your squad leaders as you play.<br/><br/>The rules feature an innovative activation and reaction fire mechanic that leaves you making important and tough choices constantly. Know when to push and when to hold off. Your men have to last for a long fire fight and you may run out of steam when you least expect it.<br/><br/>Combat is written to produce a fairly realistic level of casualties.

It's all covered.<br/><br/>The rules are written to be both playable and enjoyable on a small gaming space, using approximately a platoon plus appropriate supports, APC's and assorted vehicles on each side.<br/><br/>Run your own invented campaign or use the included systems to:<br/><br/>     Conduct &quot;Hearts and Minds&quot; peacekeeping in a foreign land (or throw the invaders out)<br/>     Fight to prevent the &quot;Domino Theory&quot; from coming true.<br/>     Engage the NATO/Warsaw Pact while hoping the conflict does not escalate out of control.<br/><br/><br/>The rules have been updated to a brand new second edition.<br/><br/>This updates and clarifies many rules, including a better assault sequence and expanded options for troop characteristics.<br/><br/>More tools have been included to help set up your own forces.<br/><br/>No End in Sight is compatible with any individually based figures.<br/><br/>Game measurements were written with 15mm figures in mind, but can be used for larger and smaller figures.<br/><br/>A typical game features about a platoon on each side, with supporting elements and vehicles.<br/><br/>&mdash;description from the publisher<br/><br/>",

        "description": "Although this is officially Part 6 in the World of Motor Racing series it is a stand-alone module and it uses different design features in many areas whilst conforming to the WoMR format in others. We did not feel confined to following too closely the earlier parts in the series as rallying is a very different form of motor sport from those simulated in Parts 1 to 5, and as such needs a different design approach - we felt it better to end up with a product that captured the feel of international rallying rather than trying to fit it into the strict WoMR formula.<br/><br/>This game allows you to recreate a full World Rally Championship season with real cars and drivers rated to perform as they do in real life. In addition, each Rally venue is rated for its unique conditions from snow, to gravel, to asphalt. Rally data is available for WRC seasons going back to 1998.<br/><br/>Rallying is all about cumulative time, that is time taken to cover the various stages plus time lost in additional servicing 'penalties', and as such presents a difficult design problem. We wanted the simulation to be realistic and accurate (of course) but also fun to play, and not bogged down by masses of paperwork in keeping track of all the entrants. A complete day of rallying can be completed in a little over an hour and an entire rally over the course of about three-four hours.<br/><br/>",

This way, navigation knowledge (NK) is gathered for the space race endgame. The second (astronaut) part will use knowledge points to tackle technical and navigational obstacles. By efficiently using the on-board lunar telescope, sextant and gyroscope, players will push their luck with their newly acquired and cunning abilities. As an astronomer, players will explore different cultural settings and discover anthropological links with astronomy.<br/><br/>1 ASTRONOMER<br/>While the time keeps on ticking and the celestial bodies keep on shifting positions, players scan the world for clues and means to finish some objectives in order to be the best prepared astronaut at the space race.<br/>Different scientific discoveries will unlock powers of astronomical instruments to shape time and space to your favour. The evolution of astronomical instruments marks new possibilities in obtaining the ultimate skill to reach for the Moon.<br/>During the astronomy part of the game the best and only the most necessary choices need to be made. The optimal strategy with the right cultural ability needs to be exploited to gain the perfect timing to leap ahead.<br/><br/>2 ASTRONAUT<br/>Once players are ready to push their luck, they will shape the future of Earthlings. Whether it is a trip to the Moon a half a century ago, or in the near future, the knowledge of the stars will guide each player towards another world. The investments in past observations and the acquired abilities before launch will help to mark your fate as the best or worst astronavigator.<br/>You need to anticipate moves of other players and take the necessary, yet minimal, risk at the right time!

Start your train line, and compete with others as you try to get a juicy government grant to expand your business. It's not going to be an easy trip with bandits lying in wait, couplings coming loose, and other locomotives trying to claim the grant for themselves.<br/><br/>Players take turns taking one action: get deliveries, cargo, or caboose (end game goals) cards, discard specific cargo cards to make deliveries, or upgrade their locomotive (flipping it over) to increase their hand limit. When making deliveries, players will place their completed delivery(s) behind their locomotive card. There are also special cargo cards which adds some &quot;Take-That&quot; into the game allowing players to play the Bandit and steal from each other, or protect themselves from Bandits by playing the Marshal. While the Loose Coupler causes you to lose one of your cargo from your hand, the Wild Cargo card acts as any cargo from any location.<br/><br/>Not only does Deliveries on Track feature both a standard and advanced mode of the game to challenge both younger and older players, it also has a unique game mode which allows players to choose which version of the game they'd like to play at the same time, creating a Mixed mode with minimal gameplay changes to the younger players. There's minimal text on cards, relying primarily on icons and drawings allowing younger players to be able to play with little issue.<br/><br/>The end game is triggered when a player has at least 5 completed deliveries. All other players have one last turn. After, all players are able to put up to two completed caboose cards on their train.

        "description": "The hottest football game not just for football fans! Footballiser is a board game in which you can conquer the world of football as both a team leader, club owner and a football player. A game where you not only get to use your strategic skills alongside your dexterity, but also have to exploit both if you want to win the cup!<br/><br/>The objective of Footballiser is to be the first player to obtain all 6 Stadium Development Items and to win the league final! Footballiser is a turn-based game, meaning in each round players get to decide what action(s) to take. Each round comprises two phases: using of an Action Card and carrying out an operation. An operation may be opting for a Stadium or Team Development (either via trading in trophies previously won for successful matches, or by rolling the Development Dice), or playing a match.<br/><br/>Stadium Development Items are to be put on one&rsquo;s Development Board, except at the start all 6 sections of the Development Board are occupied by a certain number of flags. To remove flags and therefore to make place for possible Stadium Developments, one has to win matches. When it comes to playing matches, a player has to draw a Match Cards. Match Cards come in four different difficulty levels, often depicting famous football situations. All 50 Match Cards are unique, providing you a pool of possibilities that would be extremely hard to get bored of. The Footballiser Field consist of numbered cells, making Match Cards easily understandable, and the footballer figures easily placeable on the board. One must flick the figures in a way that the figures push to ball to a selected few cells that count as a successful pass, and repeat the process a few times to kick the ball through the goal line.<br/><br/>After winning the match, the player gets to decide which section to free up for Stadium Development, although it shall not be random, as the usage of Action Cards and Power Cards are often conditioned on a certain level of Stadium Development. Power Cards provide you with a higher chance of winning matches, for example by allowing you to try again certain shots or skip otherwise necessary passes on your way to the goal. Action Cards either provide help for your development in game, or offer up an opportunity to set someone else&rsquo;s development back, for example by having them put Development Items back in the pack or by making them skip turns or limiting their choice when their turn comes. If all the flags are taken off of the Development Board, all Stadium Development Items are placed on their rightful places on the Development Board, you may proceed to play the league final. When you win that, you win the game.<br/><br/>",

This is a treasure hunt of the greatest scale!<br/><br/>In Terra Loop, you take part in a special race to collect a priceless ancient currency - the Tolar. All Tolar is in denomination of 50,100,200 and 500. Each player begins with one Robot Peg and a console mat, with two sections - Unsaved Tolar and Saved Tolar. The game board is placed in the middle. you start at home and on your turn move around by rolling the dice. The goal of the game is to collect and save maximum Tolar. Whenever you land back at home, all your Tolar in the unsaved section moves to the saved section. There are three main places on the board where you collect Tolar. These are called the checkpoints. All checkpoints are hard stops, which means you have to stop here and cannot skip it. When you reach a checkpoint, roll the dice and multiply by 100. collect that amount of Tolar and place it in your unsaved Tolar section. There are other various parts on the board, where you can either lose or gain tolar, or even an extra dice to roll. When another player lands on the same place as you, they cut you, and get all your unsaved Tolar and you go to a pre-mentioned spot on the board. Remember, you never lose your saved Tolar. ever. so, when someone cuts you only give them your unsaved Tolar. if you have saved all your Tolar, you give up nothing! When you have collected an extra dice, you reach the next checkpoint, roll both dice and multiply by 100. Collect this much Tolar and then place the dice back on the board. <br/>The game ends, when all the Tolar has been collected. each player gets all of their saved Tolar but only half of their unsaved Tolar. The player with the most Tolar wins.<br/><br/>Terra Loop takes your entire family on an adventure like never before. Your kids will never look at learning the same way after this magical educational experience. Enjoy with them as they traverse through various lands collecting a precious ancient currency.

You don't want to get stuck there and lose out on fares! You can play for as long and short as you like. The player with most money at the end wins.<br/><br/>",

It is based mainly on Mythos-related materials from Chambers and Bierce, drawn directly from the original sources.<br/><br/>The disturbances caused by the upcoming Great Ritual have started to tear apart the fabric of reality, and well-known places have already been replaced by a distorted version of themselves coming from other dimensions. Meanwhile, the King in Yellow and its agent, the Pallid Mask, are manipulating events from behind the curtain, and poisoning the very thoughts of unsuspecting people. And who is the mysterious plump man that appears to be following the group?<br/><br/>Carcosa Rising includes a new Investigator class (the Dreamer), three alternative versions of locations from the basic game, an entire new location (Carcosa), three event tables for traveling, possible attacks from the Pallid Mask (who takes control of the body of Investigators gone Insane), and a final Encounter with the King in Yellow.<br/><br/>This is a non-standalone expansion. Players can choose to add any combination of elements from Carcosa Rising to the base game, mixing and matching materials to ensure that no two games will be the same.<br/><br/>&mdash;description from the publisher<br/><br/>",

        "description": "Age of Trains is a retrofuturistic train game in which you aim to pick up and deliver cargo to and from various locations on the map. The game can be played by 2-5 people (depending on the map used). Finishing it requires playing through a certain number of rounds (also determined by the map used), during which we gain Victory Points. The player with the most Victory Points at the end is the winner.<br/><br/>The game&rsquo;s mechanics revolve around the &lsquo;pick up and deliver&rsquo; core - you plan your movement across the hexagonal map board, determine the cargo you want to pick up (originating from both private and public sector), and deliver it to the chosen city or port. The more you deliver, the more you can pick up for future transports. By buying the &lsquo;port stock tiles&rsquo; you increase your chance of gaining more Victory Points.<br/><br/>Apart from the map boards (each depicting the real country with the original names on it, but  adapted to the game&rsquo;s mechanics), the game also features: <br/>- the game board (used for determining the players&rsquo; actions, monitoring the opponent&rsquo;s development, and upgrading our train), <br/>- the player&rsquo;s board (used for monitoring player's progress and the improvements made to the train). <br/>The train&rsquo;s upgrades are divided into 4 categories (engine, hopper wagon, additional wagons, and hiring a specialist), with each upgrade creating new opportunities for the player. Pair it up with the special cards, allowing you to break some of the rules, and you can be sure that each playthrough will differ and require the players to change their tactics and stay vigilant for the opponents&rsquo; moves.<br/><br/>",

Before the game begins, Commanders will customize their capital ships and corvettes to suit their playstyle and strategy.<br/><br/>Star Eater uses an inertia based movement system. Each turn a commander can fire the capital ship engines to gain, bleed off, or redirect their momentum. Acquired momentum is tracked with tokens and each turn the momentum will continue to affect the capital ships movement turn after turn until it is removed.<br/><br/>Each turn, both players will place face down: an engine Dial with a setting selected and 2 command cards.<br/>When both players agree that they are ready, they will reveal their engine dials at the same time, then apply the relevant momentum to their capital ship. All capital ships on the board are then moved according to the momentum they possess.<br/>Once movement is complete, the players reveal their command cards simultaneously and play out their effects.<br/><br/>Most commands attract cooldown which removes them from the game for a set number of turns after use. The amount of cooldown attracted by a particular command is determined by the components that commander has chosen to outfit their capital ship with.<br/>There are 8 command cards, each of which will activate one component of the warship; main and broadside weapons, point defense turrets and shields, emergency engine power and various special abilities. Controlling corvettes is also done via command cards.<br/><br/>Capital ships are composed of many sections. Each individual piece of the capital ship has its own armor rating, and the ship as a whole has an internal structure health. To damage your opponent's structural health, you must strip away their armor and then land shots in the resulting gap. When a capital ship runs out of internal structure health, it is destroyed and their opponent wins.<br/><br/>&mdash;description from the designer<br/><br/>",

        "description": "The Tu'x Rebellion and is based on an entirely new IP.  It is a cooperative/competitive Medieval Fantasy Strategy Game of my creation.<br/>In the base game two to four players take on the roles of Noble Houses fighting for the King, gaining favor by winning battles and proving themselves worthy administrators in the midst of a Civil War. Players work together to overcome the rebels while competing with your allies to earn the most favor from the throne.<br/><br/>Key Features:<br/><br/>     Factions:  Pick from one of four houses to play as during the campaign (House Kel, Lotan, Shobal, or the 7th Corps). Each Noble House has their own individual and unique strategy.<br/>     Base Building:  increase your power and prestige by constructing military, defensive and economical buildings that can gain access to greater resources and higher quality troop types as they are upgraded.<br/>     Resources:  As you expand influence and improve your land, you gain access to more resources. These need to be properly handled in order to bolster your power, help you grow and gain favor with the King.<br/>     Army Recruiting:  Create your own army from core loyalist warriors and elite house troops.  Customize your army according to your vision. Train units to meet battlefield demands. Cooperate by sharing units through alliances to defeat the rebels and unite the loyalist factions.<br/>     Political intrigue:  Internal and External events can quickly change the fortune for you and your fellow loyalists.  Manipulate these events to further your own goals while hindering those of your rivals.<br/>     Battles:  Wage war against the rebels in skirmishes as small as five units or up to a massive battle of forty units.  Gather your allies to form large armies to bring the battle to the doorstep of the rebels.<br/><br/><br/>The Tu'x Rebellion is a card-based strategy game similar to other customizable trading card games with battle tactics similar to tabletop miniature games. Players take turns simultaneously.  Each round is divided into phases; draw, build, conflict and discard.  Simultaneous play means the game is exciting for everyone and no one is left waiting to take action.<br/><br/>Battles are resolved in the conflict phase. One round of battle is split into the: Set up, Draw, Infantry, Ranged, Cavalry, Movement and Discard phases.  Action continues for allied players and the player controlling the Rebel Army during the battle.<br/><br/>You win by reaching a certain threshold of favor with the King.  However, everyone loses if the loyalists are defeated twice in battle or any player loses all the troops under their command.  Players must constantly balance the competitive and cooperative aspects of the game.<br/><br/><br/>&mdash;description from designer<br/><br/>",

        "description": "Murder of Crows is a somewhat cooperative, somewhat competitive murder mystery card game combined with tag.<br/><br/>At the start of a round, players gather in a circle and draw one card each, assigning them a role for the round. The player who draws the Crow card has to &quot;kill&quot; the other players.<br/><br/>Each player separates from the other players and goes into hiding, somewhat like hide and seek. However, some players will reveal themselves at times. For example, a character with the Shield needs to pass it on, and so, they will search for others to pass it to. The Hunter wants to be able to observe others in order to find out who potentially could be the Crow. The Crow needs to hunt (seek) the others. Typically the Seer and the Villagers try to hide but also be receptive to finding the Shield. And so, each turn is an interplay between hiding, finding out more information, and finding ways to end the round in their favor.<br/><br/>The Crow &quot;kills&quot; another player by simply whispering into their ear / near them, &quot;You're dead.&quot; Alternatively, they can say, &quot;You're dead; you're my Zombie&quot; to the one chosen Zombie character per round. The Hunter &quot;kills&quot; another player by loudly saying, &quot;Bam! You're dead!&quot; then revealing that they are the Hunter. No other player has the capacity to kill, aside from if someone reveals to the the Crow when they are tagged &quot;dead&quot; that they have the Shield.<br/><br/>The other players have to identify the Crow and defend themselves with a &quot;Shield.&quot; Some of the other players also have special abilities to partner with other players, defend themselves, or kill other players as well. The Shield must be passed from player to player every minute and is only way other players can protect themselves from being murdered.<br/><br/>Rounds can last from roughly 3 - 20 minutes. When a round is over, the cards are reshuffled, the Shield is reset, and a new round begins with the dealing of the cards. Participants can play as many rounds as they wish. No formal score keeping is necessary. The game is adaptable and comes with extra cards for the option of building out custom rules.<br/><br/>",

        "description": "Siege Command is a two-player, lane-based strategy game containing a mixture of simultaneous planning and turn-based strategy. Deploying a variety of Units and casting powerful Spells, players battle for control over the Turrets in each of the 4 lanes in order to destroy their opponent's walls.<br/><br/>In the simultaneous Planning Phase, both players place a Unit card from their hand face-down in front of each of the 4 lanes (or a Bluff card to hide their intent) and Spell cards off to the side of the battlefield. Once both players are ready, they reveal their played cards, pay the combined energy cost, and attempt to predict their opponent's strategy before proceeding to the turn-based Action Phase.<br/><br/>In the Action Phase, both players alternate resolving a single card at a time until all cards on the table have been resolved. Players can choose to resolve any Spell or Unit on the table in any order they wish. When resolving Units, players must resolve all of its Action Points in a single activation and then exhaust that Unit for the duration of the round. The main objective during this phase is to establish and maintain control over the battlefield and Turrets, while trying to keep Units alive long enough to reach the opponent's walls.<br/><br/>After the Action Phase, any captured Turrets deal damage directly to the controller's opponent and the game proceeds to the next round following a quick Refresh Phase. Gameplay continues in this manner over several rounds until one player (or both) reach 0 health. If one of the players remains with at least 1 health, they are declared the winner - if not, the game ends with both players standing among the smoldering ashes of their outpost in a draw.<br/><br/>",

Drivers are not allowed to enter this space but every year it attracts plenty of daredevils, who want to gain underground fame. So year by year the race is being continued against the law and Factions. Even enormous barricades put across main routes didn't stop that madness. Racers quickly found new methods and tricks. Imagine that each supervising Faction is equipped with giant machines: Bulldozers and Transporters. Their only purpose is to wipe this terrain off from all racers. But why not to use their roofs to jump over the barricades and move on? These days all suffer from shortage of oil. So it quickly turned out that Factions willingly accept oil bribes and can help your small car jump over the barricade. However it worked short. Soon all racers have been continuously bribing the Factions and using them even against you. The bribe is the bribe. The Faction doesn't care for whom it works. So, prepare for high adrenaline. You will compete with 3 other racers and 4 Factions that will be your friends as long as you fuel them up. And then will go to your competitor.<br/><br/>&mdash;description from the designer<br/><br/>",

        "description": "Shapes and lines are essential building blocks in our visual vocabulary. If you look, you will see rectangles, squares, cones, triangles, circles, straight lines and curved lines in everything around you. The ability to identify basic shapes and how they relate to each other is the foundation for understanding and solving more complex geometrical and patterning problems.<br/><br/>Asymbol provides you with 47 unique shapes to pick from as you assemble things, beings, places and events/activities to challenge others to guess your vision!<br/><br/>Object of the Game<br/>Players take turns being an Asymbler (builder) by drawing a card, choosing one of the two subjects and using the various shaped pieces to create their subject. At the same time, the other players try to guess what is being created. The correct guesser and the Asymbler each earn a point. The player with the most points at the end of the game wins.<br/><br/>Setup<br/>Place all 47 Asymbol pieces in the middle of the play area.<br/><br/>Shuffle the card deck, and place it facedown next to the Asymbol pieces, creating a draw pile.<br/><br/>Give each player a pass token to be placed near them.<br/><br/>Hand the scorepad and pencil to a player to keep score for each round.<br/><br/>When starting the game, determine how many rounds to play before the game ends. A round ends when each player has had the chance to be the Asymbler.<br/><br/>The first player to name a shape starts as the first Asymbler.<br/><br/>Make sure the Asymbler can reach the pieces and has enough space in front of them to build.<br/><br/>How to Play<br/>On your turn as the Asymbler, draw the top card from the deck, keeping it hidden from the other players, and choose one of its two subjects.<br/><br/>Pass Token<br/>If both subjects are unfamiliar or too challenging, you may use your pass token to discard your current card and draw a new one from the draw pile. After using the token, return it to the box. Each player has only one opportunity to use their token as an Asymbler, so choose wisely.<br/><br/>Categories<br/>When you are ready to start, announce the category of your chosen subject.  Only share the category and not the subject you are going to create.<br/><br/>Assembling and Guessing<br/>To create your subject, use any number of the Asymbol pieces from the play area. You can create with pieces lying flat or by building vertically. Moving the pieces is allowed to show motion and help portray your subject. You may not speak while you build, but making sound effects is allowed. You may use body language (nods and hand gestures) to indicate if a player&rsquo;s guess is on the right track or not. Once you begin to assemble, all the other players can start guessing. They guess at the same time and can continue to make guesses until someone&rsquo;s guess is correct. There is no time limit, but you may end your turn if you feel like no one can correctly guess the subject. Otherwise, the turn ends after a correct guess, and play continues clockwise.<br/><br/>Scoring<br/>The first player to correctly guess the subject gets a point. If multiple players guess correctly at the same time, they all get a point. As Asymbler, you also receive a point for successfully creating a subject that another player could recognize. If there are no correct guesses and you choose to end your turn, then no one scores any points that turn.  Return all the pieces you used to the play area, and place your card in the discard pile. Play continues clockwise with the next player becoming the Asymbler, drawing a new card, announcing a category and creating their subject with the pieces.<br/><br/>End of Game <br/>After the agreed upon number of rounds has been completed, the player with the most points wins. In case of a tie, the players share the victory.<br/><br/>-description from publisher<br/><br/>",

Read and answer the question aloud that appears on the block and then stack it on top. The last player to stack a block without making the tower fall wins the game. The most avid reader assembles the tower and then goes first. Play passes to the left. On your turn, carefully remove one block from anywhere below the highest completed story of the tower. Use only one hand. Then stack the block on top of the tower at right angles to the blocks just below it. As the block is removed, read the question on it out loud. Answer the question and let the conversation flow as you stack the block on top of the tower. You can touch blocks to find a loose one, but if you move a block out of place, you must put it back in place using one hand only before touching another block. While stacking, always complete a 3-block story before starting a higher one. Your turn ends 10 seconds after you stack your block or as soon as the next player touches one.<br/><br/>",

        "description": "&ldquo;Time is like a sword; if you don't cut it, it cuts you&quot;<br/>(Arabic proverb)<br/><br/>Asedio a Al-Andalus: the Legend of the Wolf &amp; the Serpent (1150-1213) is a medieval strategy, geopolitics and diplomacy boardgame for 3 players that tries to represent the political, ideological and military conflicts that took place in the Iberian Peninsula and its areas of influence between the second half of the 12th century and the early 13th century, in an exciting time of crusades, epic battles and court intrigues.<br/><br/>This is a crucial 63-year interval in the history of Spain, Portugal and the Mediterranean Sea, characterized by a balance of power between the Christian world of the north and the Muslim world of the south: the first, fragmented into five different kingdoms (Portugal, Navarre, Aragon-Barcelona, Leon and Castile) but with a clear expansive and conquering vocation since the turn of the millennium, and the second, reinforced after the rise to power of an austere and powerful North African dynasty with a rigorous vision of Islam (the Almohad Caliphate). However, there was also a third peninsular power, autochthonous Hispanic Islam, heir to the cultural splendor of the extinct Umayyad Caliphate of C&oacute;rdoba and now, doubly threatened by the Christian crusade and the Almohad jihad, desperately trying to fight for its own independence (the Sharq Al-Andalus, represented by the Levantine emirate of Murcia-Valencia, under the Banu Mard&aacute;nish dynasty, and by the Pirate emirate of Mallorca, under the Banu Ganiyya dynasty).<br/><br/>In the game, each player will take the role of one of the three main powers (Christian Kingdoms, Sharq Al-Andalus and Almohad Caliphate) that vied for power, hegemony and survival in the Iberian Peninsula during those troubled years. Whether through military force, political cunning, seductive diplomacy, commercial wealth or cultural splendor, the player's objective will be to accumulate the greatest number of victory points to become the peninsular power with more fame and glory.<br/><br/>Mechanically, the game uses a card-driven system, consists of 7 turns and each of them represents a period of 9 years, beginning in the year 1150 and ending in the year 1213. At the same time, each turn is divided into 5 different phases. The game is completely asymmetrical, as each power has its own geographic position, resources, rulers, courtiers, military leaders, allied factions, and totally unique and specific thematic minigames. The game ends if one of the following conditions is met: that a player reaches 50 victory points, that the end of turn 7 is reached (the player with the most victory points wins) or that the Sharq Al-Andalus is annexed (in which case the Christian player or the Almohad player will win, depending on their victory points).<br/><br/>The conquests of Alfonso VII of Leon &quot;The Emperor&quot;, the Almohad invasion, the Mediterranean takeoff of Catalonia, the resurgence of an independent Al-Andalus in the peculiar figure of the libertine emir &quot;The Wolf&quot;, the Castilian civil war between the feuding families Lara and Castro, the appearance in Navarre of Richard &quot;The Lionheart&quot;, the French influence in Occitania-Provence, the commercial relations with the maritime republics of Genoa and Pisa, the last blows of the Byzantine Empire, the offensives in the Maghreb of the ancient Vikings from the Kingdom of Sicily and the Ayyubid Egyptians of Sultan Saladin, Majorcan piracy led by his corsair emir &ldquo;The Serpent&rdquo;, the Arab and Berber revolts in Ifriquiyya, the construction of the Seville mosque, the recovery of Aristotelian philosophy by Ibn Rush, the political intrigues of Queen Eleanor Plantagenet, the II, III and IV Crusades in the Holy Land, Simon de Montfort's crusade against the Cathars, the consolidation of the Camino de Santiago, the publication of the Song of the Cid or the epic battles of Alarcos and Navas de Tolosa, are just some of the many national and international historical events that the player will be able to relive in first person throughout the game.<br/><br/>Welcome to a world of swords and shields, castles and sieges, knights and pirates, kings and courtiers, emirs and caliphs, bishops and imams, ambassadors and pilgrims, merchants and philosophers, cathedrals and mosques, holy wars, palace conspiracies, and even, maritime expeditions to the exotic Orient. Will you be able to survive the Siege of Al-Andalus?<br/><br/>",

Gallamut Zeers, now filled with industry and frowns, was once a land filled with lush vegetation and wonderful beasts. The Lords of Gallamut Zeers settled on this fertile island long ago, but quickly decided they could not share it with each other, because they were grumpy and itchy. Their moustaches tickled their noses something fierce and their socks were made of wool, which is scratchy, you know! So they quarreled and debated and demanded, as all those who feel entitled do, until they concluded who would own and rule the various parts of the fruitful island. Here, and there, and everywhere they bickered! Silly Lords, there&rsquo;s plenty of space to go around!<br/><br/>In The Formative Years of Gallamut Zeers, players take on the roles of Lords of Gallamut Zeers struggling to gain dominion over the island. Over three years, players will claim roads, occupy cities, set up encampments, and make diplomacy in an attempt to outwit their opponents. The player who employs the most clever tactics and the most efficient strategy to accumulate the most points will win the game!<br/><br/>The Formative Years of Gallamut Zeers is a tactical area-control/majority game which is played over 3 rounds. Each round, players will play four of six available action cards to place and manipulate cubes to score points. Between the rounds, players will take part in a simultaneous secret action selection to take a bonus action or block other players from taking an action. At the end of each round, there are eight categories in which players may score points.<br/><br/>",

        "description": "After a year-and-a-half of being &ldquo;in country&rdquo;, the US Joint Chiefs of Staff and many in the Pentagon were becoming increasingly concerned that the war in South Vietnam was not going according to plan. Despite increasingly optimistic reports and news conferences from the head of MACV, Military Assistance Command, Vietnam, General William Westmoreland, the Viet Cong insurgency against the South Vietnamese government, although bloodied and beaten in several major engagements, was still dangerous and growing thanks to increasing aid from Communist North Vietnam.<br/><br/>General Westmoreland put forward in the Fall of 1966 a bold plan to invade the southern &ldquo;pan handle&rdquo; of North Vietnam as well as neighboring areas of Laos through which the Communist&rsquo;s supply line (dubbed the &ldquo;Ho Chi Minh Trail&rdquo;) ran. The plan was to take and hold these areas to interdict the Communist&rsquo;s support to the South, as well as compel the NVA (North Vietnamese Army) to do battle in the open against the US and ARVN (Army of the Republic of Vietnam) to take back their occupied homeland and supply lines. General Westmoreland reasoned this was a fight the enemy could not avoid, and one we could not lose. The cost to conduct the planned invasion was for another 206,000 men (six additional divisions plus support personnel) to be deployed to the region. This would dangerously deplete the US military&rsquo;s strategic reserve, as well as escalating the conflict to the point of risking global war with China and the Soviet Union. Would this plan have worked in bringing about a military solution to the Vietnam War, or would it have just &ldquo;widened the stage&rdquo; of this tragic quagmire for the US?<br/><br/>Can you do as well or better than your historical counterparts? Learn and enjoy!<br/><br/>Players will need a standard deck of playing cards including both Joker cards, a D6, and one D10 to play the game. A custom card set, that replaces the standard deck of playing cards is available from the publisher.<br/><br/>Each turn represents 3 or 4 days of time. A hex is about ten miles across. Combat units are either battalions (II) or companies (I). Kind of a Drag is designed by Paul Rohrbaugh and features graphics by Ilya Kudriashov.<br/><br/>",

        "description": "Jiangshi: Blood in the Banquet Hall is a collaborative, storytelling RPG about a Chinese-American family making their living by running a restaurant in one of America&rsquo;s Chinatowns, circa 1920. Despite societal backlash and anti-Chinese laws, they have turned a profit and their quality of life has recently improved.<br/><br/>Players take on the roles of members in the family, spanning three generations, who face threats of Jiangshi (hopping vampires) at night and oppression by day.<br/><br/>Players must balance the responsibility of running and maintaining their family business with protecting themselves and their community from the supernatural forces.<br/><br/>A game session takes place over a number of days, alternating between day and night scenes where the roleplaying scenes take place. During the day characters complete assigned restaurant tasks in order to keep the family business running. And the Game Moderator will out a tableau of Restaurant cards that the family will need to complete before diners start to arrive. Their success is determined by using Resilience slots from their characters to complete the tasks.<br/><br/>Once the tasks have been completed to the best of the family&rsquo;s abilities, the GM takes any Restaurant cards that were left undone and places them on the central Restaurant board, rotating them such that the consequences face the players and cover the restaurant&rsquo;s slots.<br/><br/>Prior to starting the morning scenes, each character must see how they&rsquo;re feeling from the trials and tribulations of the previous day. Each player rolls 1D4 and receives that many Mung cards from the GM which represent the dreams and nightmares of the characters.<br/><br/>Colored Mung cards are good dreams, black-and-white Mung cards are nightmares, and must be used to cover a trait on their Character sheet. Covered traits are unusable until the bad dream is removed via role-play. If a character is unable to remove the bad dream Mung cards that cover up all of the traits on their character sheet, then the character is turned into a Jiangshi, a vampire. The black-and-white Mung cards are flipped over to reveal new skills.<br/><br/>To remove the Jiangshi from the restaurant the players have 10 seconds to write a short phrase or sentence on it that captures how the family of characters stays strong and together. If the group is able to complete the phrase in the 10 second period (GM keeps count) then the Jiangshi is immobilized and can be then healed through gameplay.<br/><br/>The whole group of players (not including the Game Moderator) starts with a Family pool of six eight-sided dice (6D8) on the 1st day. As they progress through the days, player characters start feeling the stress the hauntings on the family, reducing their pool of dice available. These dice are used to overcome challenges, or to help council and care for the emotional health of the family, removing Mung cards from their character sheets.<br/><br/>",

        "description": "In 1823, U.S. Secretary of State John Quincy Adams wrote to the American Minister to Spain, noting that Spanish-ruled Cuba would likely be annexed by the United States within the next 50 years. Despite several attempts, that did not happen, though in 1898 the U.S. defeated Spain and made Cuba a puppet state.<br/><br/>In Caribbean Empires, Part One, the Maine crisis of 1898 brings the United States and Spain to the brink of war, but the newspaper circulation wars do not spill over into an actual armed conflict. That comes a decade later, after both have built up their forces in anticipation of a naval war in the Caribbean basin. And in 1908, the United States finds a pretext to start an invasion of Spain&rsquo;s Caribbean Empire.<br/><br/>Caribbean Empires, Part One is an expansion set for Great War at Sea: Remember the Maine. It adds 80 new pieces (60 &ldquo;long&rdquo; ship pieces and 20 standard-sized ones), and uses pieces and the map from Remember the Maine. The Americans have the pre-dreadnought battleships of the Great White Fleet, plus some other designs that were considered but never built. The Spanish have also built a fleet of pre-dreadnoughts, pouring resources into an effort to keep their empire alive and maintain the long-departed illusion of Great Power status.<br/><br/>&mdash;description from the publisher<br/><br/>",

Then Admiral of the Fleet and its companion publications The Flag Officer's Handbook and AOTF Scenarios Volume I may be just what you are looking for.<br/><br/>Due to the popularity of surface-only engagements and the difficulties inherent in an accurate portrayal of the additional dimensions required by the addition of aircraft and submarines to the game table, AOTF focuses exclusively on surface warfare during the age of the battleship.<br/><br/>&mdash;description from the designer<br/><br/>",

        "description": "One of the most numerous and nightmarish of all the void creatures are the HellBats; swarms of slithering demons with leathery bat-like wings that darken the skies and bring ruin on worlds that they infest. HellBats are hatched from grotesque Spires of gnarled muscle built by a Brood Mother, housing countless mucus covered eggs. With a supernaturally fast gestation cycle, these Spires can hatch thousands of HellBats in a matter of days, and are only limited by having a steady supply of fresh flesh to feed upon. When that supply runs dry, the Spires simply go dormant until a new supply can be found, awakening the Spires once more.<br/><br/>An Enemy Swarm Pack is a new themed set of cards focusing on fighting swarms of a particular Enemy Type, as well as a new set of Spawners for that Enemy Type. In this case, the pack focuses on fighting large swarms of HellBats, and has Hatchling Spires that spawn new HellBats during a Fight.<br/><br/>This pack also includes Enemy Record Sheets for the OtherWorld variants of HellBats (BogBats, LavaBats, and LungBats), with the stats and modifiers worked into the Enemy Record Sheet itself, as well as new themed Elite Charts and Brutal sides for these variants.<br/><br/>A new Mission, HellBat Infestation, allows the Heroes to go on an adventure to clear out an infestation of these demonic creatures that is plaguing the area. This set assumes you have access to the HellBat Enemies (miniatures and cards) from the Swamps of Death Core Set, and does include an additional set of 6 HellBat miniatures, giving you a swarm of at least 12.<br/><br/>Hatchling Spires are a new Enemy introduced in this set, that act as Spawners for HellBats. Tall towers of ridged and gnarled demonic flesh, covered in large leathery eggs, the Hatchling Spires twist and sway as the creatures of the Void rapidly gestate inside before bursting forth. At the end of every Turn, each Hatchling Spire in play rolls 2 six-sided dice to Spawn new HellBats. This creates a new goal within the Fight for the Heroes to battle their way to the Hatchling Spires and take them out before you are overwhelmed by the flood of HellBats. This can be dangerous though as the Acidic Burst ability showers nearby Heroes with deadly acid every time a Spire takes damage from an Attack. In addition, the Spongy Sacks of the Hatchling Spire grant it +2 Defense against all Ranged Attacks made from half Range or greater of that Attack.<br/><br/>Contents:<br/><br/>     4 Large Enemy Record Sheet <br/>     3 Large plastic Hatchling Spire miniatures<br/>     6 plastic HellBat miniatures<br/>     1 Rule Sheet with new Mission &ndash; HellBat Infestation<br/>     15 Game Cards<br/><br/><br/>",

Both countries have one army and one civilian power deck. Each deck contains intelligence and attack cards, and a Joker card. Each side has a power deck as well as an event card drawn at the beginning of each round, independently of the sides. In the game, which is based on turn-based gameplay, after a series of successive preparation phases, the skirmish phase comes. In the preparation phase, the sides manage their hands; draw a card, change or lay -there is also the mechanic of advancing the convoy of the Russian side-. When it comes to the skirmish round, the dice are rolled by calculating the combos and advantages of the drawn cards: depending on the result, either the Russian convoy was stopped or damaged, or the Ukrainian side's attempts were unsuccessful.<br/><br/>If the convoy reaches Kyiv by capturing the cities on its way, one after the other, until the end of the grand tour, and thereby capturing the capital, it will be successful. On the other hand, if the Ukrainian side neutralizes the invasion attempt by slowing down the convoy or destroying all of them one by one, they win.<br/><br/>Prepare your strategy, follow your opponent closely and wish you luck. Be brave or cautious; The fate of the war is in your hands.<br/><br/>&mdash;description from the designer<br/><br/>",

        "description": "The Dresden-class cruiser Emden, known as the 'Swan of the Orient', belonged to the German Oriental Fleet during the First World War. She was to be used in the Indian Ocean to intercept merchant ships. Her captain treated the crews of captured merchant vessels with courtesy and behaviour in accordance with international wartime law, and the ship remained in the spotlight even after she was grounded and abandoned after the battle of 9 November 1914 with HMAS Sydney. The game relives the exploits of the Emden.<br/><br/>&quot;SMS EMDEN&quot; is a single-player (solitaire) simulation wargame. The player controls the EMDEN, which navigates into several areas around the Indian Ocean, and completes missions such as 'coastal bombardment', 'trade disruption', 'raids' and 'landings' to score victory points. The Emden's main mission is to destroy trade, which means that battles with hostile warships are sometimes unavoidable. Players may be forced to fight head-on or, at certain times, to flee.<br/><br/>An important part of the game is the replenishment of 'coal', which is needed to allow the ship to perform her missions. Coal is an abstract representation of Emden's capacity for action. Therefore, resource management, impacting which actions to perform and how much can be performed, is a critical element of the game.<br/><br/>Contents:<br/><br/>        120 piece (20mm, 15mm square)<br/>        1 map (A2 size)<br/>        2 sheets of cards (16 cards)<br/>        2 charts (A4 size)<br/>        1 rulebook<br/><br/><br/>An issue game of Command Magazine Japan #167.<br/><br/>",

Relive the fury of air combat over Europe during World War II as you direct each airplane in multiple fighter and bomber squadrons to lead attacks on the enemy's airfields, manufacturing locations, and other ground objectives.<br/><br/>Move each airplane individually on a hex grid. When you maneuver to get an enemy airplane in your sights, it must try to dodge or else take damage. Some airplanes can use bombs to destroy ground installations. Stay in formation to keep the initiative and dominate your opponent. Each airplane has its own attributes in terms of speed, armor, and special abilities. Each piece is illustrated as close as possible to its historical model to maximize your immersion!<br/>&nbsp;<br/>The base game contains a large modular board, player aids, and all the tokens you will need to play. This includes several squadrons of Hurricanes and Spitfires as well as Messerschmidt Bf109, Heinkel 111 and Junker 88.<br/><br/>Fighters of Europe is scenario-driven. The base game comes with ten different scenarios. With practice, you will be able to set up your own scenarios very quickly.<br/><br/>No dice, no rulers &mdash; only dozens of airplanes! A fast-paced and streamlined game mechanism that plunges you right into the heart of battle.<br/><br/>-description from publisher<br/><br/>",

It is meant to be fun, quick to play and have opponents which are challenging to race against but easy to operate. Up to ten different Tanks race against, and fire at, each other across ten different tracks with the ultimate aim of being the first to cross the winning line. Tanks range from strong, slower heavyweights such as the Tiger and the Churchill, to weaker, faster light tanks such as the M3 Stuart.<br/><br/>The game has been designed primarily as a solo game but there is no reason why two or more players cannot race against each other. Indeed, tanks controlled by the game system, used in solitaire play, can be added to a multiplayer game to fill out the race as and when desired.<br/><br/>It is also possible for the player(s) to control more than one Tank. More than one Race can also be run by the same Tanks, on the same or different Tracks, to create a competition.<br/><br/>&mdash;description from the designer<br/><br/>",

        "description": "An Enemy Swarm Pack is a new themed set of cards focusing on fighting swarms of a particular Enemy Type, as well as a new set of Spawners for that Enemy Type. In this case, the pack focuses on fighting rampaging swarms of hungry Slashers and has a Feeding Burrow that spawns new Slashers during a Fight.<br/><br/>This pack also includes Enemy Record Sheets for the OtherWorld variants of Slashers (Swamp Slashers and Gorged Slashers, as well as two new OtherWorld variants... Larval Slashers and Slashers of the Deep), with the stats and modifiers worked into the Enemy Record Sheet itself, as well as new themed Elite Charts and Brutal sides for these variants.<br/><br/>A new Mission, Feeding Frenzy, allows the Heroes to go on an adventure to hunt down the burrow of these beastly creatures that are rampaging through the area.  This set assumes you have access to the Slasher Enemies (miniatures and cards) from the ''Swamps of Death'' Core Set and does include an additional set of 6 Slasher miniatures, giving you a swarm of up to 9 of these savage beasts.<br/><br/>This set contains miniatures for 1 XL Feeding Burrow as well as 6 large Slashers.<br/><br/>The Feeding Burrow is a new Enemy introduced in this set, that acts as a Spawner for Slashers. A large rocky outcropping of Dark Stone, it is the ideal burrow for a nest of Slashers that bury themselves in the ground, feeding on the black rock. At the end of every Turn, more Dark Stone markers are added to the Feeding Burrow, until there is enough to spawn a new Slasher, consuming the Dark Stone as it erupts from the ground! This creates a new goal within the Fight for the Heroes to battle their way to the Feeding Burrow and destroy it before you are overwhelmed by a flood of Slashers. This can be dangerous though as the Dark Stone Radiation of the black rock can add up fast. The Burrow itself though can be a good source of some extra Dark Stone for the Heroes.<br/><br/>",

Join one of two tribes &mdash; the Cherrygnawers or the Trailblazers &mdash; and explore unknown terrain, competing with your rival for the most valuable resources.<br/><br/>Each turn in Misty Valley, a player adds a valley tile to the playing area from the two on display or the top of the face-down stack; if you place a tile with footprints, you add an encounter tile from that stack, with each encounter showing a forest critter who has one or two demands. Next, place one of your three patrol tiles in hand next to one or more tiles in play. These patrol tiles show your tribe members on various edges, and if you now have more tribe members adjacent to a valley tile or encounter tile than the other tribe, mark that tile with one of your banners.<br/><br/>On a turn, you can move your captain figure to a tile that you control to add 1 to your tribe's strength on that tile. Additionally, you can play one of your three special abilities to rotate a tile, move a tile, play an additional tile, etc. (Each tribe has a double-sided board, and you choose a side &mdash; and abilities &mdash; before play begins.)<br/><br/>Once the final valley tile is placed, the opponent places a final patrol tile, then you tally points. The more valley tiles you control with the same resource, the more points you earn &mdash; and if you've satisfied the demands of an encounter, you earn bonus points for making a fellow critter happy. Whoever has the most points wins.<br/><br/>",

Only one had been laid down, but not completed, when France fell to the Germans in 1940.<br/><br/>Golden Journal No. 50: French Carriers provides you with 30 new Second World War at Sea pieces for the lone French carrier, three proposed carrier designs that never would never be laid down, and the one design that did reach the slipway.

        "description": "House Bolton rules from Dreadfort, their ancient edifice in the north. Descendants of the First Men, they are known for their sigil of a flayed man, a practice that they often partake in. Aggressive to the core, they fought in a rebellion against House Stark many years ago.<br/><br/>They have been likened to rabid dogs, lashing out against anyone that gets too close, even their own. Troops in House Bolton often fear their own commanders more than the enemy. Roose and Ramsay Bolton rule with iron, spiked fists. Their reputation for brutality and cruelty causes many foes to simply quit the battlefield. Better to run away and survive than be captured. Woe to anyone who ends up in House Bolton's clutches after a battle.<br/><br/>As with all starter sets for the game, the Bolton Starter Set comes with everything a player will need to get started in the game with the Bolton faction. It includes a rulebook, terrain templates, all necessary tokens, as well as the Bolton Tactics Deck and custom dice for the faction.<br/><br/>Perhaps unsurprisingly, the Boltons don&rsquo;t have a lot of loyal allies. Therefore, House Bolton will be a mini-faction, with a Starter Set and a few dedicated units to go with them. The Starter Set has two units of Bolton Cutthroats, a unit of Bolton Blackguards (both of which have been previously released as Neutral Units), and a new unit, the Dreadfort Archers.<br/><br/>However, something players will notice is that some of these units come with two different sets of unit cards. This is because while these units can be used as Neutral mercenaries by other factions, they also have unique Bolton Faction cards as well. These are differentiated by the color and border art.<br/><br/>This holds true for other cards for the House. The Unit, Attachment, Commander, Tactics, and NCU cards also come in two forms, one to use when they are hired as Neutral mercenaries and the other when they are for a Bolton-specific army.<br/><br/>The one difference in the Starter Set is the Dreadfort Archers. This new ranged unit is used exclusively when taking an all-House Bolton army. These remorseless warriors will rain down arrows on any enemy, regardless of intervening units or terrain. They also don&rsquo;t care if said enemy is engaged in close combat with their own allies. They will still attack, damning their own troops to possibly suffer Wounds as well. But, if it takes out more enemies than allies, it&rsquo;s considered a net positive for House Bolton. Such is life in a House with such casual disregard for life.<br/><br/>The Starter Set also includes all new characters for House Bolton. Jeyne Poole and Fat Walda make their presence felt as NCUs, altering the battlefield from afar. They are not ones to hire themselves out, so they can only be used when taking a House Bolton force.<br/><br/>",

        "description": "In February 1942, the German Navy prepared a top-secret mission, known as Operation Cerberus, to move the battle cruisers Scharnhorst and Gneisenau (known to British sailors as the &ldquo;Wicked Sisters&rdquo;) and heavy cruiser Prinz Eugen from Brest in western France to Norway. Without special training operations or any other moves that might alert the British, they would suddenly dart up the narrow English Channel. The daring &ldquo;Channel Dash&rdquo; caught the British by surprise, and all three ships made it to German though Gneisenau suffered damage that would never be fully repaired.<br/><br/>As a cover story for the preparations, the German Navy put about the rumor that the three ships would head south, around the Cape of Good Hope and across the Indian Ocean to join the Japanese in the Dutch East Indies. Crews were told of this objective, tropical helmets and uniforms were loaded, and rumors spread through the French dock workers.<br/><br/>Wicked Sisters is a Second World War at Sea Campaign Study making this deception a reality. It&rsquo;s a set of thirteen scenarios tracing this cruise that never happened. The German squadron is pretty much on its own until they reach safe harbor.

They use events like the Olympic Games to spread their deadly effects. To be a step ahead of the human scientists, the players develop special features like infection by blood, infection via animals, or resistance against medicine, heat or cold.<br/><br/>The game is played in clockwise order. On your turn, draw an event card, which forces you to take back one or more of your tokens from the board (healing a city). If it is the last one in this city, the &quot;healing token&quot; on the specific track moves forward and you lose if it meets your marker on that track. The event card also gives you some additional &quot;DNS points&quot;, which are akin to money. In the second step of your turn, you spread your virus depending only the methods for infection you have already developed. You gain additional DNS-points for each infection, such as placing new tokens onto the board in the cities. Third, you develop (buy for DNS) more features for your virus like infection via animal, resistance against cold or medicine, or your ability to kill people. Finally, you throw dice according to your skill for killing, and depending on the result, you replace your tokens on the board with dead tokens.<br/><br/>The players win if they have placed all dead tokens in the cities. They lose if the draw pile runs out or the human beings have made enough healing steps on the specific track.<br/><br/>Will you be able to save the planet and reduce the population of the greatest danger for the world &mdash; human beings?<br/><br/>",

        "description": "The Battle of Kulikovo was fought between the armies of the Golden Horde under the command of Mamai, and various Russian principalities under the united command of Prince Dmitri of Moscow. The battle took place on 8 September 1380, at the Kulikovo Field near the Don River and was won by Dmitri, who became known as Donskoy (of the Don) after the battle. Although the victory did not end the Mongol rule over the Russian principalities, it is widely regarded by Russian historians as the turning point when Mongol influence began to wane and Muscovite power to rise&mdash;a process that eventually led to Muscovite independence and formation of the modern Russian state.<br/><br/>This is a typical hex and counter game. Initiative is determined in each scenario and kept for the entire game. Players perform their actions in order, with possible reactions (when enemy units enter missle range). Example:<br/><br/>1. Player A moves cavalry (reaction fire possible)<br/>2. Cavalry of player A attacks<br/>3. Player A moves infantry (reaction fire possible)<br/>4. Infantry of player A attacks<br/>5. Player B moves cavalry etc.<br/><br/>Movement is determined by terrain and unit type. Battles are determined by comparing unit strength, which is modified by various factors (armor, charge, terrain, leaders etc.), and dice roll. Interesting elements of game mechanics include: fatigue of units, morale and cavalry movement (turning requires more space).<br/><br/>",

At the end of the round, the Diss Jockey awards the best choice a &quot;Hit&quot; Card worth 1 point, and the worst choice a &quot;Diss&quot; Card worth -1 point.<br/><br/>The Diss Jockey has the option to stop the song at any point and move on to the next one by holding up the &quot;Skip&quot; Card.<br/><br/>The Hit and Diss Cards are drawn to set the theme of the round, as well as serving as each player's score. The Diss Cards follow this format: &quot;This _____ Song&quot; and the Hit cards follow this format: &quot;That _______&quot;. So the theme is set by drawing 3 of each, selecting the Hit and Diss cards to use, and returning the unused cards to the bottom of their respective decks.<br/><br/>Sample Themes:<br/><br/>This 90's song that reminds you of your ex.<br/>This Pop song that you wouldn't want to hear right before your colonoscopy<br/>This Sentimental song that sucks and everyone is too stupid to realize it.<br/><br/>",

        "description": "Flappy Families is a family-friendly card game for 2 - 5 players where players collect sets of native New Zealand birds while trying to avoid the Predators!<br/><br/>Players will have to engage their memory to try and match birds of the same families. As well as flipping cards face up on the board players will be putting their own cards face down onto the board. They will be able to use this information to try and make future matches - unless another player foils their plan!<br/><br/>At the end of the game the player with the best collection of birds, judged by having large families and by collecting birds from the special bonus point families, will be crowned the winner.<br/><br/>The game features 51 unique illustrations of native New Zealand birds, as well as the fearsome predator: the Stoat. The beautiful illustrations have been made by the talented Auckland-based Sam Kim.<br/><br/>&mdash;description from the designer<br/><br/>",

Larger. Then, in the first edition, I had involuntarily omitted the Italian flag. Now there is!<br/>The combat values have changed, and the counters are more numerous thanks to the new artillery units.<br/>There are multiple elite modifiers in the units.<br/><br/>The big news in the rules is represented by the artillery bombardment; when used en masse very effective. The games are shorter and the players cannot afford to make mistakes!<br/>The activation mechanism is the same; the command range for all formations is somewhat reduced; this requires that the formations not disperse too much during the game. The cavalry charge becomes simpler and more brutal; more risky but which can lead to great results.<br/>The ENGAGED result is eliminated, in its place SHAKEN appears, very different in effect and much less complicated. The CRT changes, it is definitely easier to use.<br/><br/>There is an optional system for playing with DUMMY, in two ways: either by masking the stacks or by using displays showing the groups of counters defined by the DUMMY.<br/><br/>",

        "description": "Ardennes II is a Standard Combat Series reissuing of the award-winning game Ardennes from 1994 using the additional research available in the BCS game Last Blitzkrieg. Like its predecessor, it covers the German Wacht am Rhein offensive in December 1944 against the heretofore &ldquo;quiet front&rdquo; of the Ardennes Forest.<br/><br/>Despite heavy losses on both the Western and Eastern Fronts, the German Army attempted to re-invigorate its offensive forces using drafts of the elderly, infirm, and very young.   The defending US forces were recovering from the dash across France and using the Ardennes area to give exhausted units a chance to refit and to give their new reinforcements some modest battle-zone experience.<br/><br/>The result went down in history as the Battle of the Bulge.<br/><br/>Overcoming the initial surprise, the US forces put together a series of determined defenses, numerous timely bridge destructions, and the incredible power of their well-supplied artillery to stop the vaunted German Panzer troops nearly dead in their tracks.<br/><br/>Ardennes II covers all this action in turns representing one day of combat and a hex scale of 1 mile per hex. Units are usually reinforced battalions (or smaller). The full campaign game lasts only 16 turns from 16 Dec to 31 Dec 44.<br/><br/>In addition to spotlighting the better OOB and map research first used in Last Blitzkrieg, the game differs from its predecessor by highlighting the unique nature of the artillery on both sides, correcting the original&rsquo;s &ldquo;Supply Wagon&rdquo; supply system, as well as giving units the opportunity to withdraw before an enemy attack. It also cuts back on the amount of chrome rules which the player needed to wade through, and which exaggerated the effects of some marginal forces.<br/><br/>The game continues the SCS tradition of a very clean and easily played Sequence of Play, clear unit interactions, and straight-forward victory determination.<br/><br/>This game is highly recommended for those interested in learning for the first time or teaching the fine hobby of wargaming to beginners.<br/><br/>Scenarios:<br/>Ardennes Campaign, 2 maps, 16 turns<br/>Breakthrough Campaign, 1 map, 6 turns<br/>KG Peiper, part of 1 map, 5 turns<br/>The Goose Egg, part of 1 map, 5 turns<br/>Bastogne: Screaming Eagles Under Siege, parts of 2 maps, 8 turns<br/>Tip of the Spear, 1 map, 4 turns<br/><br/>&mdash;description from the publisher<br/><br/>",

        "description": "Bushido is a game of savage battles, of cunning stratagems and last-ditch defences, and where debts of honour are paid in blood. In Bushido, the fate of the world hangs not on armies but on individual heroes, men and women of extraordinary capacity, attuned to the all-permeating life force known as Ki. This force is the very fabric of the universe, and those with the appropriate training or natural talent can tap into this energy source and gain seemingly superhuman powers. In the world of Bushido, the delicate tapestry of Ki &ndash; and thus the universe itself &ndash;is threatened by the forces of imbalance, and it is up to you to protect it &ndash; or help rip it apart. In a game of Bushido, nothing less than the universe itself is at stake. Are you ready for the challenge of the Way of the Warrior?<br/><br/>There are currently nine factions at war within the Jwar Isles:<br/><br/>The prefecture of Ryu<br/>The Dragon Clan won the rights to colonize the Westward Isles in a series of duels with their rivals, the Shiho Clan. However, when the Emperor's vessel expired, and his young heir, too young and inexperienced to concern himself with the petty disputes at the fringes of his lands, the promise of sole settlement rights died with him. The newly formed Prefecture of Ryu found themselves yet again in conflict with their old enemies, the Shiho Clan. Now, the Prefecture&rsquo;s grasp of power is weakened, due to the recent Tsunami. Their forces are in disarray, they are fighting on all fronts in the aftermath of the disaster. But still the men and women of the Dragon are ready to take their place at Destiny&rsquo;s table, uniting the human world by defending it against all threats.<br/><br/>The Temple of Ro-Kan<br/>The serene martial artist masters of the Ro-Kan have long viewed themselves as above all mortal and mundane conflicts. Now, following the Han civil war, the rise of the Cult of Yurei, and the incursion of the Savage Wave, the monks of Ro-Kan are being dragged into the clandestine wars of universal balance &ndash; a war in which they will reluctantly turn out to be key players. The monks follow an age-old path and know the secrets of Ki better than any others, but they are few and divided &ndash; will they be able to unite and join forces before it is too late?<br/><br/>The Savage Wave<br/>They take the form of evil creatures of myth and folklore. From where they come or why, no-one knows, but one thing is for certain, the wave crushes everything in its path. The Oni and Bakemono demon-creatures that make up the bulk of the Savage Wave appear bent on the destruction of humankind and all that is holy, but they are not mindless &ndash; as many opponents have found out at great pain, the Savage Wave is cunning and organized, and it operates according to its own weird and unknowable logic. Some mad hermits and outcast scholars whisper that this is not the first Savage Wave...<br/><br/>The Cult of Yurei<br/>In the shadows and dark corners of the world, the worshippers of Yurei are gathering force. The many members of this Cult may not even be aware that they are serving the same dark masters, but serve them they do &ndash; the Yurei Bargain, which in its various forms allows control over life and death, has proven a temptation to many different people who would otherwise have nothing in common. In the Cult of Yurei, you may think yourself the master of your own Fate but you are always advancing the unfathomable goals of dark unseen masters. Even a puppet master has someone pulling his strings...<br/><br/>The Ito<br/>The Ito have long been the laughing stock of the ruling clans. Never quite able to understand that it is their own flaws which hold their greater ambitions back. Being untrustworthy is synonymous with the Ito in the Jwar Isles; their support of the Shiho&rsquo;s rise to power followed by their treacherous role in the Dragon Wars against the very same clan, highlights their fickle nature. Now though the Ito on the island of Izu have gone through a transformation, their alliance with an age old and powerful Kami has imbued them with a new found strength. If it was the Kami that caused the snake like changes or whether it has simply exaggerated the Ito&rsquo;s natural affinity is unknown. What is sure is that the Ito finally have the power to rise against the other clans and avenge the mockery and mistreatment they have suffered. Will this venomous clan prove to be one dose of poison too much for the Jwar Isles?<br/><br/>Silvermoon Trade Syndicate<br/>The thriving port of Jima is the beating heart of the Silvermoon Trade Syndicate&rsquo;s operations. For generations the merchants of the syndicate have been the trade life blood of the Jwar isles. From the great gambling halls, where fortunes are won or lost, on the roll of a single dice or the draw of a card. A bustling and bountiful harbour brimming with exotic goods and rare delights. Famed arenas where colossal Jumo warriors clash in a brutal dance, or an array of fighting beasts struggle in a battle to the death. Water houses where ones wildest fantasies can become reality with the touch of a Rose. Their power lies not the in military might of the Ito, Takashi or Minimoto but in the stranglehold they have on trade. And not only the trade of goods, but of the secrets and whispers of even the most pious. Some would liken the Silvermoon to the flip of a coin. Pay your debts and you come up in the sun with the fortunes smiling, cross or try to cheat them and you&rsquo;ll be in the dark and covered in dirt.<br/><br/>Tengu Descension<br/>For countless cycles the elders of the mountain have watched and waited, their quiet vigil in the high places of the world unbroken. Silently they have over seen the rise and fall of innumerable clans, the petty squabbles of mortals bare no relevance to their goal. Gifted with generations of knowledge passed down through the written teachings of the Karasu Shugenja and oral histories of the Koroko Shisai the Tengu hold the secrets of the world in the their high homes.<br/><br/>Now stirred into action, one can only imagine the danger that looms that has rustled the Tengu to war.<br/><br/>Jung Pirates<br/>When years passed without word of the Jung, they were considered lost, their return under the mon of the giant squid surprised everyone. They have reaped what they need from the traders on the seas of the Jwar Isles, forcing the Shiho to label them pirates. Their fleets are faster and their knowledge of the Isles&rsquo; waters are unparalleled by all but perhaps the Carp clan, allowing them to evade the larger, less experienced junks of the Prefecture. Long years away from the courts of the Jwar Isles have left the Jung rough around the edges but they have not forgotten their ancestry.<br/><br/>Kage Kaze Zoku<br/>The Kage Kaze Zoku (Shadow wind clan) are deadly ninjas with a grudge against just about everybody.<br/><br/>",

        "description": "District Commander: ZNO centers on insurgent and counter-insurgent operations and tactics during the Algerian War of Independence. The game deals unflinchingly with the weapons with which this war was fought &ndash; terror cells, double agents, the forced resettlement of ethnic and religious groups &ndash; prompting uneasy questions about how governments obtain, hold, and use power.<br/><br/>Brian Train's District Commander is a series of operational games on counterinsurgency situations. The players alternate activation of groups of units (stacks) to perform discrete operations (missions) through the expenditure of Task Points (TP). Some missions are Tactical Missions - straightforward military tasks such as performing patrols, ambushing or attacking enemy forces, or moving from one place to another - and these may be performed multiple times by a stack during a turn. Other missions emphasize the &quot;non-tactical&quot; end of the campaign, establishing friendly influence, control, and infrastructure in an area, reducing the enemy's claim to the same, and recruiting or training troops. These missions take more time to perform and so unlike the tactical missions may be the only mission performed by the stack during the turn.<br/><br/>Missions are resolved by play of secretly-held Chance Chits, each with ratings that are better or worse for certain types of operations. Chits are played simultaneously and the ratings compared, modified by units, assets, and the current board state to determine the outcome. Using the right chit at the right time - knowing when to save a good chit for later and when to use it, and trying to determine if your opponent is going all-in or holding back - will require steely judgment in an atmosphere of doubt and deception.<br/><br/>All this is done in pursuit of objectives handed down to you by your superiors (i.e., chosen randomly) and kept secret from your opponent - objectives that may even change over the course of the game. Within this framework, the two sides - Government and Insurgent - play very differently, with the Insurgent player, in particular, depending on bluff and deception to achieve their goals. A large number of variant rules allow you to turn the game into a sandbox for exploring counterinsurgency doctrine and practice.<br/><br/>&mdash;description from the publisher<br/><br/>",

        "description": "Metroplex Roma boasts an exact replica of the ancient Roman Colosseum, but at twice the size! Plus, it sits atop the Caesarium Arcology, making it one of the most recognizable points of the Roman skyline.<br/><br/>In ancient times, gladiators fought each other and wild animals in the Colosseum. SPQR has opted to emulate this in the Legion&rsquo;s home arena by unleashing random mavericks into the games. These athletes owe allegiance to no team, and earn money for each athlete that they slaughter! This results in a very chaotic game as the wild mavericks engage in all sorts of mayhem. Indeed, sometimes they even help a team that they might like. Often, Legion benefits from this maverick benevolence, making opposing teams wonder if there is some corruption going on. No proof of such has ever been presented, however.<br/><br/>Of course, some mavericks are more popular than others. Simba Khan elicits the most fan excitement, of course. Other butchers are also favorites, such as The Barbarian, Warren Johnston, Sandy Petersen, the Unspeakable One, and Four-Fisted Farouk. Razors are the least favorite, of course, because the fans want wild mavericks who can inflict maximum damage.<br/><br/>The Colosseum is an arena board for Slaughterball.<br/><br/>Special rules:<br/>The Legion pits include spaces called Maverick Pillars, indicated by the M. These spaces block movement and no athlete can enter them. However, random mavericks appear on them to wreak havoc with all teams.<br/><br/>When the goals are opened, the first maverick is revealed. Draw a random maverick card and place the matching maverick figure on a random Maverick Pillar. This is a Wild Maverick, who owes allegiance to no single team. It is his job to cause as much mayhem as possible, attacking and thwarting all teams.<br/><br/>To simulate this, each coach can control any wild maverick during their Onslaught phase.<br/><br/>",

Those among Gods, who cared about it&rsquo;s mortal inhabitants, raised some of the falling fragments of the Earth and imbued them with the ability to float in the sky. From that very moment, the survivors from the Old World have been living and dying on those flying islands, trying to grow and develop their kingdoms.<br/><br/>Thousand years had passed since the Cataclysm, when the long-awaited Prophet wrote the legendary Book of Entirety. A book that holds the way to recreate the Crystal of the World and with it, to reforge the remnants of land into a New World. The most crucial part of the plan turns out to be collecting of Essence of the Old Earth, that could be crystallized in a few different ways to create Shards &ndash; fragments of the Great Crystal. And so, the battle has begun. Each kingdom and race want to claim the power of the crystals, rebuild the world and rule it indefinitely.<br/><br/>The Essence is a strategy board game for 2-5 players. Each player takes on a role of one of the factions that struggles for dominance in this magic-punk world of mysterious powers and powerful technology.<br/><br/>During the game you will develop your &bdquo;flying kingdom&rdquo;, build, expand, hire loyal advisors, fight other nations and complete quests which will bring you closer to your ultimate goal &ndash; rebuilding the Great Crystal and becoming the Emperor of the New World! Each turn you can take one of the following actions:<br/><br/><br/>    Add a segment to your island (a building or monument)<br/>    Complete a quest<br/>    Take one main action and as many side actions as you want (including attacking, gathering supplies, gaining prestige points, trade etc.)<br/><br/><br/>Everything in order to crystallize enough Essence to create more Shards of the Crystal than your opponents.<br/><br/>",

The premise of this game is a sudden war has erupted on the Korean peninsula, compelling China to intervene in the conflict&mdash;this time well before the United States could reinforce South Korea sufficiently to prevent it from being overrun. The Chinese realize there may never be another opportunity to completely extirpate the US from the Asian mainland, they have irrevocably committed themselves to this path, and thus it is their resolute intention to finally settle old scores with the Empire of the Sun. The map covers the militarily significant terrain of Japan and surrounding areas. Each hex on the map equals ~36 miles (58 kilometers) from side to side. Each game turn represents about a week. Playing pieces represent divisions and brigades, as well as occasional regiments and even battalions.<br/><br/>&mdash;description from the publisher<br/><br/>",

        "description": "Rugby The Game is all about putting you right in the middle of the action. The playing board is clear and simple to use, keeping a focus on the action, front-and-centre.<br/><br/>The board is split with teams facing each other. There are six slots on the board for active players, a field ruler to indicate the position of the ball on the field, and slots for  Player decks and General Play Cards.<br/><br/>The middle of the game board visualises the action happening around the ball. Sure there are 15 players on each team, but only a handful are in action at any time.<br/><br/>Each phase of play involves each team taking one action, such as running, bringing in support players, tackling, kicking, etc, and then resolving the outcome. For example, if the attacking team chooses to run (action), they simply move the field marker on the ruler. Play then goes to the defending team who can try and tackle (action), a successful tackle goes to a Ruck, and an unsuccessful tackle means play returns to the attacker.<br/><br/>&mdash;description from the designer<br/><br/>",

You're leading one of the space agencies that are working together to expand their presence on the base, while at the same time the three major corporations sponsoring the mission are each pursuing their own agenda. In Shackleton Base: A Journey to the Moon, you will build structures on the base, while also funding projects from the corporations that provide special abilities and scoring opportunities.<br/><br/>At the start of the game, pick three corporations randomly from the seven available. Each corporation introduces new projects, actions, and scoring opportunities, along with their specific mechanisms. The game is played over three rounds, each divided into three phases:<br/><br/>&bull; Shuttle phase: Each player drafts a shuttle tile from an open display to determine which type of astronauts and resources they can use that round, as well as the turn order for the next phase.<br/><br/>&bull; Action phase: Players take turns deploying their astronauts on the moon to collect resources, build structures, or fund projects. Depending on which corporations were selected, different types of resources will be available, resources that can be used in various ways for the projects or to build structures. Each project provides ongoing abilities and scoring opportunities. Each corporation provides different ways to score points, which could be during the action phase, the maintenance phase, or at game's end.<br/><br/>&bull; Maintenance phase: Deployed astronauts are assigned to work on the structures (providing a bonus to the player owning them), then players collect income and pay maintenance costs. If corporations in play have end-round effects, those effects take place.<br/><br/>The end of the game brings a final scoring, then the player with the most points wins.<br/><br/>",

        "description": "This is a new series based on the Death Ride game system.  This series will be comprised of a base game, 16Pz, with the rules, charts, markers, dice, etc that enable play of the other modules.  The other modules will include 29PzGr, 16Pz Expansion, and Herman Goering/15PzGr.  Each of these will focus on about a divisions worth of Germans and Allies and include the maps and unit counters specific to those elements.  The entire beachhead will be covered when the entire series is complete.<br/><br/>The total game package will have the equivalent of 7 and a half 22 x 34 map sheets.  Most modules will have just (2) 22 x 34 maps.  Each module will have a number of scenarios that allow for smaller table space and game play duration.<br/><br/>The system has some enhancements with unit counters, such as the use of silouhettes for tanks and color coding of the different organizations for ease of tracing command and control.  The rules are well written and efficient.  They are clear and easy to read.  They are organized in a manner that aides learning.  They are structured along the 7 Battlefield Operating Systems which are Command and Control, Maneuver, Fire Support, Combat Service Support, Intelligence, Mobility and Survivability, and Air Defense.  This provides a real world view of the rules as opposed to a gamers view of the rules, but will greatly ease the learning curve and put the rules into proper context.<br/><br/>The units are modeled as Platoons for the Germans and mostly Companies and some platoons for the Allies.  Units have Secondary and Primary weapons and may use these in conjunction with each other or separately against the same or different targets.<br/><br/>A key feature of the game system is the Operations Phase.  During this time most of the action occurs.  One player may perform movement, fire, overrun, go into reserve, or setup in overwatch, and do it in any order the player wants.  This allows for a free flow of action that more closely resembles combat and the execution of smaller parts of the overall plan.  The non-phasing player must keep a close eye on the enemy as they may use opportunity fire to slow or stop the movement they don't like.  They may also use reserves to bolster the defense.  Players will see that this gives them maximum flexibility and gives both players something to do at all times.<br/><br/>Both sides in this series of games will have some time on the attack and on the defense.  The Germans are defending at start and on the 13th Sept they change to the offensive as they try to force the Americans off the beach.  This helps make sure that you aren't only being pummeled and can pummel the other guy a little too.  As the allies you get a big advantage with air and naval support to help keep the Germans at bay and you even get to drop the 82nd Airborne to help secure the beachhead.  The battle starts on 10 September, the day after the landings, and there are scenarios that start at the beginning of each day to allow for smaller, shorter games.<br/><br/>",

In that time, players around the world have grown to love Starmada for its shallow learning curve, depth of experience, and ease of play, even as they differ over which release represents the One True Vision.<br/><br/>The goal of this edition, designated PROJECT UNITY, was to draw from the best parts of each incarnation of the game, from the Compendium and Starmada X, through the Admiralty Edition and 2012's Nova Rulebook, and unify those concepts in a way that allows experienced starship captains to continue enjoying the game they love while drawing new players into the fold.<br/><br/>Long-time players will be thrilled to learn there is no need to convert existing starship designs to this new edition: comprehensive rules are included which allow players to use both Admiralty and Nova ship display sheets with a minimum of modification.<br/><br/>With the release of the Unity Rulebook, we hope to revitalize the game and introduce the thrills of tabletop battles in deep space to a whole new generation. The Universal Game of Starship Combat is back, and better than ever!<br/><br/>",

Each player card is divided into offense and defense sections, allowing players to assess their strengths and weaknesses on both ends of the court. Team ratings in Bank Shot Basketball add depth and variety to the gameplay. Each team is rated based on their pace, fast break ability, and press defense.<br/><br/>To simulate the fast-paced nature of basketball, Bank Shot Basketball uses two distinct Fast Action Card decks: the &ldquo;Action&rdquo; deck and the &ldquo;Fast Break&rdquo; deck. These decks contain a variety of match-ups and results to begin and resolve each possession. In addition to the Fast Action Card decks, two six-sided dice and two ten-sided dice are used to simulate the various possibilities of a possession found directly on the player cards.<br/><br/>Not a fan of substituting players in and out every few minutes? Then use the &ldquo;Simulation&rdquo; game board which has a starter and bench player at each position on the board for each team. Once familiar with the game, a full game with stat keeping can be played in under 90 minutes, less when using the Simulation game board.<br/><br/>&mdash;description from the publisher<br/><br/>",

The Snipe was not a fast aircraft, even by the standards of its time, but its excellent climb and maneuverability made it a good match for contemporary German fighters and it was selected as the standard post-war single seat RAF fighter. It was flown by a number of famous aces such as William George Barker, Alexander Kazakov and Grigoriy Sapozhnikov. Designed to be used with the popular air combat game system created by Andrea Angiolino and Pier Giorgio Paglia, each WW1 Wings of Glory Airplane Pack is a ready-to-play model, painted and assembled, 100% compatible with any other WW1 Wings of Glory game product. In each pack you will find all you need to play with the airplane: a special base with gaming stats, a variable altitude flying stand, and a specific deck of maneuver cards.<br/><br/>",

Each player controls a Territory made of 15 cards and tries to win points (called Honors), or prevent other players from doing so... The player who starts the trick decides the suit the trick will be played in (among 4). The cards all have different values depending on the suit, and the weakest one of the trick may play a special rule called Virtue which can turn the trick and the game around.<br/><br/>Players are able to put a card in a safe place, exchange one card with each other, and sucker punch one another.<br/><br/>At the end of each round, Honors are counted, and players switch Territory.<br/><br/>The game ends after 3 rounds.

        "description": "This is a never-released version of Black Rose Wars created by Ludus Magnus Studios. It is for 2 players and follows the basic rules of the original Black Rose Wars game with minor adjustments. It is a cut-out game contained within the Fourth edition of the LMS magazine called Ashes. It contains a folded board with a smaller Lodge that has 2 mage sheets printed near the edges. It comes with 1 new school of magic 'Agony' and 3 forgotten spells.  There are no events or quest cards, instead those are printed on the game board and events are followed over the 3 turns of the game. The players control 2 new mages and can summon a new evocation called a succubus to inflict damage to others and pain upon themselves. This is a great way to introduce new players to the world of Black Rose Wars. Games are estimated at 30-60 minutes.<br/><br/>",

Players divide their starting force into multiple wings, then draw two deployment cards (include) and choose one.  Players deploy their wings in the order listed, and fight the battle to conclusion.<br/><br/>2.  There have been significant changes to the skirmisher rules to better reflect the realities of combat between armies with poor and better skirmishing capabilities.<br/><br/>3.  Linear infantry (typically pre- or early Napoleonic) has been strengthened relative to massed infantry and there are new rules for dispersed artillery (formerly called battalion guns).<br/><br/>",

        "description": "At Last &ndash; A&amp;A Arnhem &rsquo;44 &ndash; Operation Market Garden!<br/>This new series from cadet is called the Armies and Alliances series (A&amp;A). The first in this series is no surprise &ndash; it&rsquo;s &ldquo;A&amp;A Arnhem &rsquo;44.&rdquo;  With the familiar miniatures representing tanks, infantry, artillery, 88s, fighters, bombers, Airborne units and Waffen SS, this game is exactly what the community has been waiting for. 52 Action cards enhance the historical &ldquo;storyboard&rdquo; of the battle while a simple, yet realistic combat system means every decision and roll of the dice makes a difference. With a big, beautiful map created by Marc Von Martial and an easy-to-read large-print highly-illustrated rulebook, this game is ready to hit the table the minute you get the shrink wrap off! <br/>The game has 114 minis and 52 game cards, plus the map is two big, bad 22x34 mounted sections that fold out and fit together for the ultimate Market-Garden experience.  All segments of the campaign are included - from Eindhoven through &quot;hell's highway&quot; to Nijmegen and the dangerous route to Arnhem to cross the lower Rhine.  The players get to re-fight the whole battle from the initial airborne drops to the final showdown between the II SS Panzer Corps and Allied XXX Corps.  Supply, Air combat and ground attack, Drop Zones, Engineer, Air defense and Reinforcements are all included - along with leadership effects, historical events, and plenty of &quot;easy&quot; chrome built into the design via the event cards.  It's only 10 simple turns and it plays quickly, but even the hardcore gaming enthusiast will discover a well-balanced challenge that is not to be taken for granted!<br/>Can you capture the bridges along &ldquo;Hell&rsquo;s Highway&rdquo; and hold them long enough for the XXX Corps to make it over the Rhine at Arnhem? Or will you dash the allied plans as the German player, slamming the door on the bold allied gamble? This one can go either way every time &ndash; history depends on YOU.<br/><br/>",

The rules tie into a full range of highly-detailed digitally-designed miniatures from Knuckleduster Miniatures, and fall of 2018 will see the release of four card decks, poker chips, and a hardcover rule book in support of the game. Kickstarter materials (cards, buildings, books, etc.) will start going out to backers late summer of 2018 and be available to the general public shortly afterward.<br/><br/>Players choose two actions for their character when their card is pulled from a poker deck (players typically control two characters and each character is activated on a different card). <br/>Moving, firing, and would location and severity are determined using dice. Health points are tracked using poker chips which are cashed in as hits are taken. There are mechanisms for reacting to opponent's actions, as well as rules for mounted movement and other iconic western things.<br/><br/>Characters can be given special abilities to enhance game play, and optional card decks (released fall 2018) facilitate dealing out special abilities and wounds rather than using charts from the book.<br/><br/>Right now, miniature figures, buildings and other terrain, custom dice, and a free set of rules are available from Knuckleduster.<br/><br/>&mdash;description from the publisher<br/><br/>",

This means the map is different in every game of Invasion! By placing castles on the land tiles, players collect different resources, which will allow them to build roads and castles, buy soldiers, and purchase advantage cards.<br/><br/>A player&rsquo;s king is their most valuable piece in the game. A king&rsquo;s army is more powerful, can move quicker, and can siege an enemy castle more easily. A king can only be killed when all soldiers in their army are dead, so players need to be strategic about how many soldiers they put in their king&rsquo;s army, and how they weaken their enemies&rsquo; armies.<br/><br/>Killing an enemy king gives that player a king&rsquo;s crown token, and the first player to gain two king&rsquo;s crown tokens wins the game. Players of Invasion will need to juggle using their king&rsquo;s offensive capabilities, with protecting them from their enemies. Players will siege castles, block their enemies&rsquo; movement, kill their soldiers, and battle their king&rsquo;s army in an all out war to decide who is the most powerful kingdom in the land.<br/><br/>&mdash;description from the publisher<br/><br/>",

        "description": "The Allied Counterattack at Arras, May, 1940<br/><br/>The attack by British and French armor sent shock waves down the German High Command as their vaunted SS troops fled when their antitank guns failed to penetrate the British tank armor of the Matildas. Rommel&rsquo;s panzers were no more effective and it was only when Rommel ordered his 88mm AA guns to be used at antitank weapons was the British attack halted. However, the British two tank battalions and two infantry battalions, along with several French tank companies proved quite dangerous for several hours as nothing seemed to halt them. Rommel, himself, lost his cool and told his superiors he was under attack by division. The British armor continue to advance as shells bounced off their thick armor and it was in a desperation that Rommel ordered his four 88mm AA guns to level their barrels and fire in anti-tank mode. By the time this had occurred, the damage was done and the German High Command instructed its panzer spearhead to halt.<br/><br/>Each turn is 30-45 min. Units are mostly company size. Each hex is 400-500 yards. Each game has 11x17&quot; map and has 280 counters. Rules cover historical and non-historical scenarios, use of Stukas, morale, armor strengths, leaders, random events, tactical advantages and more!<br/><br/>",

        "description": "From the back cover:<br/>&quot;Neil Thomas presents a set of fast-playing rules for wargaming the conflicts that reshaped Europe in the period 1815-78. This often-neglected period includes such significant conflicts as the Crimean War, the Italian Risorgimento, the wars of Bismarck's Prussia against Denmark, Austro-Hungary and France and ends with the Russo-Turkish war. Tactically, it saw armies struggle to adapt Napoleonic doctrines to incorporate important technological advances such as breech-loading rifles, greatly improved artillery and the first machine guns.A brief analysis of the essential strategic and tactical military developments of the period sets the context for the elegantly simple rules which are easy to learn, quick to play and yet deliver realistic outcomes. A selection of generic scenarios, covering flank attacks, pitched battles and meeting engagements, is supported by army lists for twenty-eight different armies. There are also twelve [ten, in fact] historical scenarios, ranging from the Battle of the Alma in the Crimean War to Sedan in 1870, the decisive battle of the Franco- Prussian War, each with historical background, deployment map, orders of battle and any special rules for that engagement. Useful appendices include a guide to further reading, an overview and price guide to the many scales and ranges of figures available, and a selection of useful addresses for the gamer. This is the ideal book for those new to gaming this period and veterans alike.&quot;<br/><br/>There are 5 types of generic scenarios:<br/>Pitched Battle, Meeting Engagement, Rearguard Action, Flank Attack and Mini-Game.<br/>And 10 (not 12 as the above shows) historical scenarios.<br/>16 pages of color photos.<br/><br/>",

Torch your opponents buildings, steal their silver or resources, even corrupt the bidding process for a turn. When fame and fortune are at risk, everyone has the tendency to behave a bit cutthroat.<br/><br/>The Cutthroat expansion for Builders of Blankenburg adds direct player vs. player cards to the mix, each a dastardly way to disrupt your opponents' plans and further your own goals.

If at any point the card on top of the pile matches the count then all players SLAM the pile and the last person to do so must pick up the cards.<br/><br/>Special cards affect gameplay by skipping turns or reversing the direction of play. When a round ends in which a special &quot;Bomb&quot; card was played, a new rule is added to the game from a separate deck of rule cards.<br/><br/>The new rules change how the game is played and quickly increase the number of things players have to be paying attention to!

Ignorant peasants have created colorful<br/>myths about these monsters, myths the Order has done nothing to dispel.<br/><br/>Varacolaci are not the animated corpses of suicides or unbaptized babies. Stories of their enormous tongues are just that, stories. No, the truth is far worse. Varacolaci are a further corruption of the Vampire, a Vampire infected with<br/>a large and muscular parasite. The parasite lives inside the chest of the Varacolaci and emerges through its mouth to feed, mistaken by the locals as a giant tongue. The parasite controls<br/>the host and, in return, feeds it symbiotically. However you name it, Hunters must approach the Varacolaci carefully, as they can attack from a distance.<br/><br/>Rejected as abominations by the other Creatures of the Night, the Varacolaci were so well hidden in the past century that the Order wondered if they died out. No such luck. Varshi may be the first Varacolaci Elder, at least he is far more cunning than any Varacolaci before. It is Varshi that has led the Varacolaci from<br/>their hidden lairs to advance the Night&rsquo;s cause. The Order has yet to determine Varshi&rsquo;s agenda or why the Night is tolerating<br/>his presence.<br/><br/>",

        "description": "Dead 'til Dawn is a zombie group survival game for 3 to 8 players, where you don't actually need to survive to win! In each game, you will experience a unique zombie apocalypse story line with your friends full of choices, voting, alliances, combat, and betrayals. The game plays out like a group choose-your-own-adventure, only when players die they aren't out of the game - they become zombies with their own &quot;zombie cravings&quot; that they need to satisfy to win! Dead 'til Dawn is a unique, action packed and exciting game!<br/><br/>Dead 'til Dawn Mixes Role Play with a Competitive Twist. Each player starts with a Character card, with unique abilities and/or agendas, though it's still up to the player to decide how to play! The game starts by revealing 8 yellow-bannered character cards. These are the &ldquo;core characters&rdquo; who will allow new players to ease into the game. Some characters are helpful, some selfish, and some are downright evil. If a Character dies and joins the moaning dead, the bottom half of their Character card will show how they can still win by satisfying a &ldquo;zombie craving.&quot;<br/><br/>Dead 'til Dawn plays out like a Zombie Movie. As the night falls, the survivors are hopeful - they have weapons, equipment, they're unhurt and ready to face the night. However, about half way through the game, as ammo runs low and weapons and tools have been broken or lost, and people's agendas begin to show...<br/><br/>Every game is a unique zombie story line. With 104 Event cards (or 120 with the deluxe set), 12 Setting cards (from the Dead Arm of the Law expansion), AND up to 25 possible Characters, this game never plays the same way twice.<br/><br/>Finally, players are NEVER out of the game. If a player dies, they simply switch sides and continue to play as a zombie! They draw zombie cards to achieve their &quot;zombie craving,&quot; which usually features taking down those left alive. This feature not only keeps everyone involved, but as the game progresses and more players become zombies, it greatly increases the difficulty and drama of the game.<br/><br/>&mdash;description from the designer<br/><br/>",

        "description": "Battles that Tell More than Just a Story<br/><br/>Heroes of Normandy &ndash; The Untold Stories Vol. 1 is an expansion module for Lock 'n Load Tactical's Heroes of Normandy. It contains eight new scenarios, plus a bonus scenario in which two scenarios are combined to form a larger one.  The idea for this expansion started from a long desire to tell these stories as well as enjoying hearing them.  One of the many wonderful things with books, comics and of course games is sharing the fun together.  Many hours of storytelling can start off with &ldquo;Do you remember, or I can&rsquo;t believe this happened.&rdquo; It is clear to us we weren&rsquo;t the only ones who enjoy hearing these stories.  We wanted our stories to be told with characters you know and enjoy playing our games but at the same time if you never played one of our games you would still enjoy reading these stories.  So, a number of the story elements are taken from our Lock &rsquo;n Load Tactical game series, specifically the names of leaders, heroes, units, and the occasional moments inspired by our own gameplay.  By doing this it has added a new level to our stories and added the ability and similarity for these men and their stories to live on not just in our games but also in our stories and hearts.<br/><br/>The scenarios do not have to be played in order and are presented here in the same order in which they appear in the book. Most of them can be played in 45 minutes or fewer, and the replay value is high. It was also nice to get the little-used British commando units into some more scenarios.  Three new 4K X-Maps are included that depict the lush Norman countryside, presenting winding streams, tree-lined farms, and a quaint village. Vital bridges need to be destroyed, important villages need to be controlled, daring rescues need to be made and vengeance must be doled out no matter the cost. Heroics, leadership and, as always, luck can mean the difference between victory and defeat. Now you can read or listen to the stories and then play them out on your gaming table!<br/><br/>Requirements:  To play Heroes of Normandy  &ndash; The Untold Stories you must own Lock &lsquo;n Load Tactical &ndash; Heroes of Normandy.<br/><br/>-description from publisher<br/><br/>",

        "description": "The relationship between the Egyptian and Hittite Kingdoms was never a secure one, and in 1274 war broke out once again, this time most likely over the control of the border province of Amurru (modern day Canaan province in Lebanon).  Leading a large army north Pharaoh Ramses II divided his army into several combined-armed divisions each composed of chariots, heavy and light infantry, and archers. To oppose them Hittite King Muwatalli gathered an army composed of similarly armed and equipped troops and charioteers from throughout the empire (mostly from modern day Anatolia, Lebanon and Syria).<br/><br/>The fortress of Kadesh, near the Orontes river, was the first major obstacle the Egyptians faced, but their spies assured them only the Hittite garrison and a few scattered local troops were located there. Pharaoh had divided his army on the approach march to use multiple wells along the frontier, and to save his men from the effects of marching through clouds of dust such a huge host would raise. Pharaoh and his vanguard division reached the plain beneath Kadesh and encamped to await the rest of the army&rsquo;s arrival. Unfortunately, the Hittites were already massed at Kadesh, with the bulk of their chariots concealed by camouflage along the banks of the river. When the first Egyptian reinforcement division approached from the south along the Orontes river, the Hittites launched a devastating surprise attack that virtually annihilated the Egyptian Division in minutes, sending the survivors fleeing towards Pharaoh&rsquo;s encampment. Pharaoh was faced with his greatest challenge, one that would result either in the total collapse of the Egyptian kingdom if the Hittite onslaught was not checked, or snatching victory from the jaws of defeat. Can you do as well or better?<br/><br/>Components: Each copy of A Clash of Chariots is composed of the following:<br/>&bull; One 11 by 17 inch map with Turn Record Track. <br/>&bull; 100 double-sided counters. <br/>&bull; Eight pages of full color rules.<br/><br/>Players need a standard card deck, including 2 jokers and 1 six-sided die (1D6) to play the game. A Clash of Chariots is designed by Paul Rohrbaugh with graphics by Darius Baruczewski.<br/><br/>",

Nothing spices up a good romance like a dash of bitterness and betrayal.<br/><br/>As one of Society&rsquo;s premier matchmakers, your goal remains the same &ndash; to gain the most Prestige &ndash; but you must also settle scores with your rivals to finish the game holding as few Grudges as possible.<br/><br/>Grudge cards<br/>Each player starts the game with 2 Grudge cards. During play you draw Grudge cards whenever someone does something to vex you &ndash; such as declining your proposal. Grudge cards can be played during the game to hurt your rivals. Each Grudge card in your hand subtracts 5 Prestige from your final score. So getting even is always preferable to staying mad.<br/><br/>A Change of Heart card can be played when you propose a match to alter two of your character&rsquo;s Traits &ndash; making one better and the other worse.<br/>Duel<br/><br/>Some grudges can only be settled with a Duel. In polite society this may mean a war of words, a sword fight, pistols at dawn, or even a horse race!<br/><br/>Turmoil cards potentially affect everyone but, if played cleverly, can mitigate the effects on your characters while making your rivals suffer.<br/>Lady Susan<br/><br/>A marriage to the beautiful and capricious Lady Susan is apt to be short and vexatious. A quick divorce later, and she&rsquo;s back in the game!<br/>Patronage<br/><br/>If things aren&rsquo;t going your way, you can ask an influential patron to change your luck! If you roll the Trait on the card you may change it to your patron&rsquo;s preferred Trait instead.<br/><br/>",

        "description": "Welcome to the kingdom of bees! You take over the leadership of a bee colony and try to use your workers wisely so that the colony has enough food. In addition, the bee colony should also grow and pollinate as many flowers as possible and store their nectar and pollen in the honeycombs. Without the pollination work of bees, there would hardly be any berries, fruits, such numerous vegetables and the variety of flowers. But there are also dangers lurking from voracious animals, so that individual bees must also be used as guardians. For defense against mites and bacteria, resin can be collected from the forest and used to line the honeycombs. Now a race against time begins because a bee year passes quickly and only those who are diligent and have a large bee colony with enough stored honey survive the upcoming winter!<br/><br/>&mdash;description from the designer<br/><br/>",

        "description": "Small Store Survival is about an expensive shopping street where high rents make it hard for new businesses to survive. Most stores will not make it past their start up period and quickly get replaced by others. Only a few shops manage to claim a permanent spot in this shopping street. In Small Store Survival players are entrepreneurs who are up to the challenge. These cunning businesspeople will discover what it takes to let businesses thrive at this challenging location and successfully open store after store. Will you be the most successful one of them, who shapes the future of this prestigious shopping street?<br/><br/>Small Store Survival combines hand management and action selection in a new and challenging way: Each player starts the game with the same deck of ten cards. These ten cards represent the ten different stores you will try to open during the game.<br/><br/>Players start the game with five cards in their hand and five in their draw piles. Each round players choose a card from their hand and place it on top of a card on the table that was played in the previous round (one store replaces another store). When you replace a store, you are allowed to take the action of the replaced store. The game itself also has a store in play each round. This means that each round one store won&rsquo;t get replaced. This is the store that manages to stay in the shopping street permanently and scores points at the end of the game. The cards that are played during this round are the cards that can be chosen in the next one. In order to let your store, claim a permanent spot, you will need to anticipate which action will not be picked in the next round.<br/><br/>Common actions like simply drawing new cards or reshuffling your draw pile are no free actions in this game. You can only perform them by replacing the stores that grant these actions. This makes hand management very tight. Store survival is all about selecting actions that allow you to effectively manage your hand. But even more about misleading your opponents by picking different actions then they expect and trying to read which actions other players will want or need to take. This makes Small Store Survival a highly interactive game which forces you to consider multiple aspects when selecting an action.<br/><br/>&mdash;description from the designer<br/><br/>",

His Loonknights are a unique breed of grot - convinced by Grinkrak's stirring rhetoric (and some judiciously applied psychoactive fungi) that they are truly formidable warriors. Their king encourages them in this delusion, issuing them quests that, miraculously, they sometimes survive. Snorbo sounds the charge on his spore trumpet, sending both Pokin' Snark and Grib, Da Wonky Lance, bounding and charging towards their foes. Squiggly beast missiles sail overhead as they clash with their enemies, launched by Skolko and Pronk, while Pointy Burk and Moonface Nagz bring up the rear, eager for the dregs of glory.<br/><br/>Grinkrak and his Looncourt are an unusual warband, to say the least. Weighing in at seven models, they&rsquo;re one of the largest warbands in the game, making them ideal for board control and overwhelming your opponent. By undertaking Quests - objectives unique to this warband - fighters can earn glory points and become Inspired at the same time. This set includes a full Rivals deck to use straight out of the box, and the models are all easy to build - so you can get playing nice and quick.<br/><br/>This set includes:<br/>- 7x push-fit Grinkrak&rsquo;s Looncourt miniatures &ndash; no glue required to assemble, cast in gloomy green plastic to stand out even when unpainted<br/><br/>- 7x double-sided fighter cards, one for each warrior in the warband &ndash; Grinkrak the Great, Snorbo da Spore, Pokin&rsquo; Snark, Pointy Burk, Moonface Nagz, Skolko and Pronk, and Grib, da Wonky Lance<br/><br/>- 1x Grinkrak&rsquo;s Looncourt Warband Background / Rivals Deck Card<br/><br/>A 32-card Rivals deck consisting of:<br/>- 12x Grinkrak&rsquo;s Looncourt objective cards<br/>- 10x Grinkrak&rsquo;s Looncourt gambit cards<br/>- 10x Grinkrak&rsquo;s Looncourt upgrade cards<br/><br/>Miniatures in this box are supplied unpainted and require assembly - we recommend using Citadel Colour paints.<br/><br/>",

You and your friends just opened a new restaurant specializing in salads, and the ten biggest food critics in the nation all just walked through your front door.  Get this right, and your salad shop is destined for glory.  But if you fail, your Grand Opening may become your Grand Closing.<br/><br/>Each round starts by revealing an Order card describing the critic&rsquo;s preferences.  Players take turns playing veggie/letter cards from their hand, then work together to form the longest possible word.  The team scores points both for the length of the word and for satisfying bonus criteria listed on the Order card.  After 10 orders, your cumulative score determines if the critics drive your Salad Shop to success or doom it to failure.<br/><br/>Rules are also included for Veggie Swap, a 2-3 player competitive variant.  In Veggie Swap, players take turns transforming words into new words one letter at a time.  Fail too many times and you&rsquo;re chopped from the competition.

As Myth Enemies, fighting in the name of their ancient master, the cosmic deity Kotak, they are equally at home gliding through the murky Swamps of Jargono, where many ancient ruins dedicated to Kotak still rise up from the watery marsh. On feathered wings, the Serpents of Kotak descend from the heavens to hiss and strike at those who would dare intrude on the temples dedicated to their ancient master. With long, needle-like fangs, the Feathered Serpents deliver a powerful venom to their foes, piercing armour and flesh alike. Highly agile, the winged serpents dart from target-to-target, lashing out with their tails and using their venomous bite to strike with deadly accuracy. But perhaps their most dangerous asset is the protection afforded to them by Kotak himself; a powerful death ward that can mend even the most grievous of wounds with the cosmic magik of the Ancients.<br/><br/>Includes 6 Feathered Serpents of Kotak, Cards, and Rules<br/><br/>&mdash;description from the publisher<br/><br/>Kickstarter description<br/>Fast and deadly, the Feathered Serpents have a move of 12 and Flight, allowing them to move through other models and change targets each turn. Though not particularly tough individually, these mythic beasts attack in packs, using speed and accuracy to harass their foes. Their deadly Venom Strike can ignore the target's Defense on To Hit rolls of 6+, and potentially leave them poisoned, while their high move, fast Initiative, and a 3+ Melee To Hit gives them a powerful alpha strike. This combined with their Kotak's Protection ability to cheat death makes the Feathered Serpents a scary encounter that can significantly weaken the Heroes as they push further into the sacred temples and jungles the serpents protect.<br/><br/>The Feathered Serpents have a standard set of Threat cards, as well as OtherWorld Threat cards for the Swamps of Jargono, protecting many of the ancient and crumbling ruins there once dedicated to the cosmic deity Kotak.<br/><br/>During the Shadows of Brimstone Adventures Kickstarter campaign, part of the Social Media Stretch Goals with the Setaris Ravagers.<br/><br/>",

Within days the South Korean capital of Seoul had fallen and the Republic of Korea (ROK) Army had been routed. Remnants retreated southward and finally gathered around the port city of Pusan, where American troops had begun to arrive under the authority of the United Nations. Here on the Pusan Perimeter the U.N. forces would make their final stand.<br/><br/>Korean War - Pusan Perimeter is a complete boxed game in the Panzer Grenadier series based on these fearsome battles. You do not need any other game to play all of its 48 scenarios. Design is by Jay Townsend, creator of our Saipan game.<br/><br/>The North Koreans have a wide array of Soviet-made weapons, spearheading their attack with T-34/85 tanks. The South Koreans are fairly lightly equipped, while their American allies bring the tanks and guns that won the Second World War: M26 Pershings, M24 Chaffees and a blistering helping of air power.<br/><br/>The game includes four semi-rigid mapboards, with art by Guy Riessen. The maps are fully compatible with all others in the Panzer Grenadier series (and those from Panzer Grenadier (Modern) and Infantry Attacks, too). Plus 517 playing pieces: ultra-thick, scorchless, sootless laser-cut piece, a joy just to hold in your hands. And 48 scenarios.<br/><br/>",

Your HQs can attempt to alter this sequence.  This recreates the random chaos of battlefields.   Players must watch for timing opportunities / threats; and be able to adapt their plans to battlefield conditions. You can order your troops forward but you can&rsquo;t be certain WHEN they will move.<br/><br/>There are no hexes or areas in this game.  Pieces simply move mini style across the terrain.<br/><br/>No CRT.  Players simply roll dice to score hits in combat.<br/><br/>The Confederates are badly out numbered but in good defensive terrain.  With their backs to the uncrossible Potomac river, there was only 1 route of escape to the south.  If the Federals can cut this link, Lee's army will be forced to surrender, ending the war early.<br/><br/>-&quot;Antietam  was a blast!

Remove any Closed Tokens that were put into play on their last turn.<br/>2. Receive any carrots via farming or banking. If a player cannot receive any carrots they will receive 1 carrot from the harvest.<br/>3. The player will complete one of the following.<br/>A. Purchase a Farm Card (Cost 0 carrots)<br/>B. Purchase a Steal Card (Cost 1 Carrot)<br/>C. Purchase a Rabbit Hole Card (Cost 3 Carrots) Rabbit Hole Cards may be played at anytime during the player's turn.  The only exception to this rule is if the card has a carrot with a lightning bolt and or a rabbit with a fire on its head.<br/>D. Gamble<br/>E. Bank *Note if more than 4 carrots were banked on the player's last turn, they may not bank this turn.<br/><br/>If one of the card piles or the Harvest gets depleted, this will trigger the end game. Any Rabbit Hole cards left will be counted as 2 carrots unless card otherwise specifies.  The player with the most carrots wins. In the event of a tie, the player who took their final turn earlier will be declared the winner.<br/><br/>-description from designer<br/><br/>",

It first saw active service with RAF Bomber Command in 1942 and, as the strategic bombing offensive over Europe gathered momentum, it became the main heavy bomber used by the RAF. The &quot;Lanc&quot;, as it was affectionately known, became the most famous and most successful of the Second World War night bombers, delivering 608,612 long tons of bombs in 156,000 sorties. Designed to be used with the popular air combat game system created by Andrea Angiolino and Pier Giorgio Paglia, each WW2 Wings of Glory Special Pack is a ready-to-play large size model, painted and assembled, 100% compatible with any other WW2 Wings of Glory game product. In each pack you will find all you need to play with the airplane: a special base with gaming stats, a variable altitude flying stand, and a specific deck of maneuver cards, as well as specific rules and components necessary to use the airplane. Bonus contents in this pack include one double-sided industrial complex card and special rules. This is not a complete game. To play, you must own a WW2 Rules and Accessories Pack.<br/><br/>",

Choose a scenario, gather your friends, select  your Heroes and prepare yourselves for loads of fast-paced adventure!<br/><br/>In order to move around the board, a Quodd must tumble! Tumbling activates one of five upgradable movement skills, or your Q skill (is it Q-Power?) based on the side of your Hero that is facing up after you tumble. While moving, you'll be interacting with special board obstacles and tiles like raging rivers, springs, teleporters, dangerous pits, and of course your opponents (or teammates). But don't worry... I'm sure your friends always have your best interests at heart.<br/><br/>Along your journey, be sure to collect the crystals you find on the board. They'll activate special abilities unique to your Hero, but be careful&mdash;other Heroes can steal the crystals you&rsquo;re carrying! During your turn you will also discover food, runes and other useful stuff to enhance your natural abilities, modify the board, and slow down your opponents.<br/><br/>Out in the world you&rsquo;ll also occasionally find secrets, usually hidden away in difficult to reach places, but always worth the journey as they often contain game-changing advantages for your Hero. A Hero who slows down by activating their Q will also discover the secrets of the world which are available only to those who look for them.<br/><br/>At the end of your turn you will read an event card out loud. Event cards affect all players, but don&rsquo;t panic, usually nothing bad happens&hellip; and sometimes they&rsquo;ll even invite you to upgrade your Hero!<br/> WHAT'S IN THE BOX:<br/><br/>The game includes beautiful miniatures, exceptional components, and eight beautifully illustrated, infinitely-replayable scenario maps, each offering a fun new challenge. Scenarios include races, Rallies, pick-up-and-deliver challenges, and team games like capture the crystal, sheep soccer and more!<br/><br/>On top of all that, the Quodd Heroes game system is truly a sandbox and lends itself to quick and easy building of your own home-crafted scenarios&mdash;the sky's the limit!  <br/> What&rsquo;s New in 2nd Edition<br/><br/>- Vastly improved, professionally written and edited rulebook, with more example images, an index, and quick reference for frequent rules questions<br/><br/>- Streamlined player experience with more intuitive upgrade system, player board design<br/>- New Q-Powers and Crystal Powers create a more thematically immersive, and unique feel to each Hero.<br/>- Reworked turn structure and event system remove the feeling of uncontrolled chaos and being &ldquo;beat by the game&rdquo; that some players had issues with in 1st Edition while still maintaining the feeling of an ever-changing environment.<br/>- Game ships with an organizer for fast setup<br/>- Reduced component count keeps setup and cleanup to a minimum.<br/>- Improved visual and usability design across almost every component in the game.<br/>- Hero cubes and painted miniatures replace the unpainted minis from First Edition for a more intuitive player experience.<br/>- A scenario book with durable, high quality fold out maps greatly improves setup time, and scenario quality, compared to the fully modular boards in 1st Edition.<br/>- There&rsquo;s so much more, too!<br/><br/>Quodd Heroes 2nd Edition is truly a must-experience game!<br/><br/>",

This civil war opposes, in a first conflict phase, protestants- otherwise known as Huguenots- to catholics, then royalists to League members after the accession of Henri IV to the throne in 1589. The art of war during this period of the Renaissance is rapidly changing. The great feudal landlords, steeped in morals, fight alongside mercenaries motivated by sole cupidity. The diversity of the weapons that are used offers great tactical possibilities, based on impact and fire. Gendarmes, cuirassiers, reiters, harquebusiers, lansquenets and Swiss mercenaries confront each other in a merciless fight.<br/><br/>This is a classic game system ; &laquo; I go, You go &raquo;, of average complexity, including, during the active player's phase, a sequence of reaction from the passive player, such as fire, counter-charge or tactical backstep. The maps are with areas from 300 to 500 m by side. A color code allows to easily determine the costs of movements and the line of sight. The scale of the game is one unit for 100 to 500 soldiers or one or two guns. One game turn represents a duration of 20 to 30 minutes. A corps represents either a vanguard or a rearguard, or the main body called battle.<br/><br/>The combats allow to simulate charges &laquo; en haie &raquo; (in hedge), the merciless shocks between pikemen, the artillery fire and highlight, by a support system, the combination of iron -shock- and fire -shooting. The optional rules- caracoles, orders, lost children, looting- add even more realism to the era's battles. The rules and the three battles offered are based on a thorough bibliography and researches made into books written by contemporary authors, specifically Fran&ccedil;ois de la Noue for the Protestants and Blaise de Montluc for the Catholics, and also on precise topographical plans of each battlefield that is still accessible...

        "description": "Dice-and-chart simulation game of the 100 meter dash.  The original edition includes 50 of the all-time great runners and is supplemented by a 2008 Beijing Olympics edition adding 12 more runners, for a total of 62 current and all-time great runners.  Runners include all men's Olympic champions from Charley Paddock in 1920 to Usain Bolt in 2008.  Game includes factors such as fitness, injuries, false starts, weather.  Timing options enables comparison to world records.<br/><br/>Each race consists of a series of six die rolls for each runner, building on the success (or lack thereof) on each of the prior rolls.  Each runner has a separate rating for the start, 10-30 meters, 30-50 meters, 50-70 meters, 70-90 meters, and the finish, as well as injuries, form, false starts.  Approximately 30 different venues, rated for speed (fast, slow, medium), are included, as are options for a campaign game.<br/><br/>This is strictly a sports replay simulation game, with no strategy options other than runner and course selection.  Game is published by Owzat Games under license from Lambourne Games.<br/><br/>Another description:<br/><br/>At first glance the 100 Metres track event may seem an odd choice for a sports replay game. Around 10 seconds of explosive action, nothing in the way of in-race tactics (if you discount the physiological warfare that takes place as the runners line up and get to their marks, more akin to two boxers eyeballing each other before a fight than to an athletics meeting), no 'decisions' for the replay gamer to make, just pure unleashed speed from starting blocks to tape. But an athletics sprinting coach will tell you differently.<br/><br/>Each part of the race, and the training manuals usually divide the 100 Metres into four distinct sections, Start, Pick-Up, Acceleration and Maximum Speed, require varying disciplines and techniques, and world-class sprinters all have their strengths and weaknesses, so this is what we have tried to focus on in this simulation, hopefully bringing to life the running characters of some of the All-Time-Great sprinters of the last hundred years. We have extended the training manual concept of four different sections into six, taking the runners progressively to 10m, 30m, 50m, 70m, 90m and 100m and within those six Sections each athlete's ability will vary to re-create his running style. And ability too, we hope. And here we must insert a caveat. In athletics to a degree not applicable to other timed sports performances have improved dramatically as training methods, diets and track surfaces have evolved and here we are trying to compare Charles Paddock with Maurice Green, Jesse Owens with Donovan Bailey.<br/><br/>To make this simulation 'work' we have had to use a benchmark, time wise, and up-grade the performances of athletes from earlier era to this level of performance. Because we felt that users would want to be able to get close to the current World Record (in the right circumstances with the right athletes) we have geared the simulation to 2001 season performances, assuming in doing so that the great sprinters of the past would have travelled that much quicker with all the (legal) advantages that their contemporary 'rivals' enjoy today. At the end of the day, of course, it is our judgement in all such matters, you may well disagree with that, and we can only say in our defence that we have been as objective as possible after lengthy and detailed research.<br/><br/>",

Simultaneously capturing half of the Capellan Confederation, sidelining the power of House Liao for decades, while launching a union that would eventually lead to the formation of the largest, strongest interstellar power since the original Star League&mdash;the Federated Commonwealth. However the Fox could not be content with such success and a scant decade later moved to crush his age old enemy, House Kurita. In April 3039, forces of Houses Davion and Steiner moved to slay an apparently weakened Dragon only to find the fury of teeth and claws.<br/><br/>The first in a new series, the Historicals: War of 3039 campaign sourcebook details the action involving every line unit in this pivotal war.

Here generals lead armies of their own creation on the field of battle in search of victory and glory.Not just for wargamers, Mayhem is perfect for roleplayers looking to integrate a customizable set of mass combat rules into their campaigns and adventures. The BATTLE CHEST edition includes both the core rules and the STRONGHOLD expansion.<br/><br/>Core rules feature overview:<br/><br/>- custom points based army construction<br/>- uses d4, d6, d8, d10, d12, and d20 dice<br/>- VERSUS game engine [including Deadlocks and Overdrive]<br/>- play at any scale including 6mm, 10mm, 15mm, and 28mm<br/>- players can use armies based for other systems<br/>- no casualty removal<br/>- rule for magic including spells like blink, summon, and time stop<br/>- includes quick reference sheets, army construction worksheet, and General&rsquo;s Compendium<br/>- official support from popular miniature manufacturers<br/><br/>The MAYHEM core rules give you complete control over building your army from the ground up. After creating core profiles and heroes, you have over 60 options at your disposal that can be used to equip and upgrade. These include unit designations, weapons, armor, standards, traits, abilities, and gear.<br/><br/>The VERSUS game engine layers mechanics and interactions in such a way as to provide a truly innovative and unique gaming experience. To begin with, stats in the game are not based on fixed numbers but on die types instead. Anytime that you are called upon to roll dice, you may instead choose to take the default; this is equal to half the value of the die. This choice of risk versus reward is behind every decision in the game.  These die types can be improved in steps depending on which weapons a unit is equipped with and what type of unit it is combating. This system of soft and hard counters means no complicated tables or stat lines are needed, yet it rewards the application of both tactics and strategy.<br/><br/>The game can be played at any scale, and players may use armies already based for other popular mass battle systems. Speaking of basing, there is no individual casualty removal in the game so hobbyists are free to make each unit a mini diorama. And, after you&rsquo;ve mastered the basics of battle, the STRONGHOLD expansion awaits!<br/><br/>The STRONGHOLD expansion includes rules for:<br/><br/>- advanced terrain options including the garrisoning, attacking, and burning of structures<br/>- new designations like scout, skirmisher, and heroic skirmisher<br/>- heroes to engage one another in epic challenges<br/>- battle sorcerers that can focus their magical powers to control hulking mechanical constructs or harness the fury of bound behemoths<br/>- new spells, traits, abilities, and gear<br/>- building your own strongholds and keeps including over 15 upgrades to create the ultimate fortress<br/>- siege engines and laying siege to enemy strongholds and keeps<br/>- new scenarios including border keeps and a unique mass battle multiplayer mode<br/>- campaigns and linked games with unit progression, multiple paths to victory, and seasonal weather effects<br/><br/>The expansion has been set-up as a toolbox that will allow you to pick and choose the rules that best fit your group and the gaming experience you&rsquo;re looking for. It also means that the core rules will grow and evolve along with your tactical and strategic abilities.<br/><br/>",

In order to defeat the opposing team, and for lots of laughs, a player pulls a card and sketches onto the drawing surface while their teammates try to guess the outrageous, horrendous, or possibly despicable word on the card.<br/><br/>The game winning conditions are chosen by the players to allow for a range of game lengths.  Typically a score is picked and the first team to reach that score is declared the winner.<br/><br/>Each round consists of 60 seconds of drawing and guessing by one team, and if they are unsuccessful, the opposing team can steal the point.  If multiple teams are involved, the steal is round robin based on order of play.<br/><br/>The deck of drawing blanks are divided into 6 color-coded categories:<br/><br/>(RED) Fifty-Fifty: Tame or not.  Flip and find out.<br/>(GREEN) Modern Ways of Living:  Pop culture, demented &amp; minus the culture.<br/>(ORANGE) Let's Talk About Sex:  Ok, let's.<br/>(BLUE) Things That Suck:  Think of things that suck.<br/>(WHITE) If You Know What I Mean:  *wink wink*<br/>(BROWN) You People:  What do you mean &quot;you people&quot;?<br/><br/>Included in the rulebook are several variations to the basic rules that allow expanded playability to ensure the game can be replayed again and again.  The play types include drawing as many cards as possible in a 120 second round, collecting 3 of each category, and having your opponent draw three cards and decide what you have to draw.<br/><br/>",

You barely have time to arm yourself with whatever you have handy that would make a decent weapon before it starts pouring&mdash;not cats and dogs, but sharks.<br/><br/>The officially licensed tabletop game of the cult-hit franchise, Sharknado: The Board Game! is a cooperative, scenario-based game for 1 to 4 players, ages 15 and up. Players assume the roles of brave citizens of a coastal city, working together to battle hordes of man-eating sharks as they attempt to thwart the ultimate weather phenomenon!<br/><br/>Your team will try to maintain order in your city while you strive to fulfill the win conditions of a specific scenario. This might be to destroy a Sharknado, to kill a certain number of sharks, or even to simply survive as long as you can.<br/><br/>You&rsquo;ll do this using various weapons and equipment to fight off swarms of sharks as you struggle to stay alive. If too many characters die or you fail the scenario, the game ends in defeat!<br/><br/>So are you going to be the hero of this story, or are you going to be just another victim of the most bizarre catastrophe the world has ever seen? Are you going to survive and become a legend, or succumb and become the contents of a shark&rsquo;s stomach?<br/><br/>There&rsquo;s only one way to find out...<br/><br/>",

At the end of game, the player with most treasures becomes the Pirate King.<br/><br/>In each round, players are going to divide several cards. One player make a suggestion of some cards that they should take as their share. Each other player can agree or disagree. The player who disagrees must cut the share, making it smaller. The TRICKY part is that the one who takes the share is the player who makes the last cut, not the player who makes the suggestion at first.<br/><br/>How do you get the cards you really want? How to cut a share with above average value and make others hard to cut? These problems are all parts of Priate Theory.<br/><br/>&bull;&bull;&bull;<br/><br/>在《海盗大会》中，玩家扮演各大海盗船长瓜分物资、劫掠船只获得宝藏。游戏结束时获得宝藏最多的玩家成为海贼之王。<br/>每一轮将有一些牌供玩家们瓜分。一名玩家提出自己想要的一份份额，其他玩家可以同意或不同意他的提案。不同意的玩家必须将这一份方案切小一些。有意思的是，方案中的牌将由最后做出切分的玩家而不是最初提出方案的玩家获得。<br/>如何顺利得到自己想要的牌而不被人切走，如何切分大于平均价值的份额却使其他人难以下手，都成了一门学问。<br/><br/>",

In this set, we saw two new types of cards used: Psionicists and Psionic Power Cards.  There always mixed reviews of psionicist due to this set.  Some thought (for some unknown reason to me) they were way too powerful.  The rest of us thought they still were highly underpowered compaired to wizard spells.  Also, another new concept was born: The avatar.  These very high level champions required a cleric to be discarded to get them into play, they were so powerful.  Overall, a very powerful set.  Landmark Cards: Sword of the High King (#5); Rand the Bowyer (#13); Bilago Lumen (#17); Lyr of the Mists (#23); Kelaser Redbelt (#25); Caravan Raiders (#38); Lady of Fate, Avatar of Istus (#42); Sirron, Avatar (#45); Living Wall (#58); Tako (#59); Earth Elemental (#60); Control Wind (#74); Kiri, Avatar of Kiri-Jolith (#79); Quill Pen of the Planes (c#8); Antimagic Cloud (c#16); and The Ultimate Rule Card (#18).<br/><br/>",

        "description": "Like streaming music and films for endless entertainment, you can now choose from a growing number of games in the Multi Game System. Each component in this compact system is carefully crafted to play in a wide variety of games, at home or away.<br/><br/>For centuries, playing cards have been used, to play many popular games. Today, quality wood, bronze or printed chip components are used interchangeably to play lots of games. The main components are square tiles, with colors and symbols on both sides. You can play more games, with more players, when you possess more tiles.<br/><br/>When Multi Game System books are released, you can extend your game collection. When new Multi Game System books are released you can expand your game collection. The style or type of games is growing and many games get updated with alternative play or expansions. They are created by casual and prolific designers from the USA, UK and Germany, plus a few classics designed in Ancient Egypt or the Roman Empire.<br/><br/>Build up your game library, step by step, with additional components designed for play with upcoming books. Keep your home clean and the environment green, with these compact and enduring pieces.<br/><br/>The games take you back to the lives of warriors, fishermen and other heroes of the Ancient World. They are easy to learn in a few minutes and can be played in 10 to 30 minutes or more These social abstract games, encourage players to interact in widely differing ways, from fear-driven collaboration, collusion, trickery and bluffing and deceit, and of course, competition. Enjoy adventure in the Ancient World and create your own story.<br/><br/>Chess, Latrunculi, and traditional Seega are strategic battles between two minds with nothing is left to chance and everything is open in plain sight on the battle field. The greatest mind will prevail through skillful use of his forces. Words are not spoken and only detract from victory. The real world has chance and luck, secrecy and concealment which makes Journey Stones and King&rsquo;s Ransom so much fun. More than two are usually involved in real life, so most of the social abstract games allow four or more to play. The rich relationships between many players, with shifting allegiances or when facing a common challenge are memorable. In set to play for Stella, Inuit, ILIOS or Assyrians, &ldquo;may keep them hidden from other players&rdquo;, means you may work together with some players and show your tiles, build trust and enhance cooperation! It&rsquo;s not enough to use your strategic skill and not open your mouth! Assyrians and Dream Lands rely solely on persuasion and verbal skills.<br/><br/>As you see how the components are used, you may be inspired to add to the library and create your own games, limited only by your creativity.<br/><br/>The tiles can be put together in different combinations to give the components needed to play these 25 games.<br/><br/>MGS<br/><br/>Ziggurats                                    <br/>Journey Stones<br/>Rays<br/>Silk Roads<br/>Numidia                                    <br/>Melos<br/>Latrunculi                                  <br/>Seega<br/>Kush                                        <br/>Stella<br/>Cheetah                                     <br/>King's Ransom<br/>Inuit<br/><br/>PREMIUM MGS<br/><br/>Tekel<br/>Tholos                                      <br/>Capere<br/>Agros<br/><br/>DELUXE MGS<br/><br/>Lost<br/>Floodwaters<br/>Assyrians<br/>Dark Death<br/>ILIOS                                       <br/>Raetia<br/><br/>SUPER DELUXE MGS<br/><br/>Dream Lands<br/>Summons<br/><br/>Some of the games such a Kush and Tholos are available in the system with the enhancements and expansions. Some of the classic public domain games such as Seega &amp; Latrunculi have been updated or expanded for today's players. In the same way, we show you how to play (and even improve) the modern card game King&rsquo;s Ransom with the MGS tiles.<br/><br/>It is a GAME DESIGN KIT with many styles of tiles, dice and disks for you to expand, design and develop your own games. Dream Lands is more interesting with these extra tiles and Assyrians can now be played with up to 20 players! We are designing new games and expansions which use the designer kit tiles. Take a look at how the components have been used in the 26 games and you will be inspired to design yourself.<br/><br/>You will be surprised how well the components allow you to play so many dice, card, or tile games. Checkers a simple game with the rules readily available online, and even Chess can be played with the MGS tiles. As you successfully implement more complicated games your confidence and ambition will grow.<br/><br/>The tiles can be put together in different combinations to give the components needed to play your own game designs. Game designers should get this kit and test their own games. We are open to publish your game in the next rule books, if it uses these components.<br/><br/>Versions &amp; Extras:<br/><br/>MGS<br/><br/>4 Player 14 Games       80 Square Tiles    Sets A &amp; B<br/><br/>PREMIUM MGS<br/><br/>4 Player 18 Games      120 Square Tiles    Sets A, B &amp; C<br/><br/>DELUXE MGS<br/><br/>5 Player 24 Games      160 Squarer Tiles   Sets A, B, C &amp; D<br/><br/>SUPER DELUXE MGS<br/><br/>6 Player 26 Games       40 Square Tiles    Sets A, B, C, D &amp; E<br/><br/>GAME DESIGNER KIT GDK   40 Square Tiles    Expansion Set F<br/><br/>TREASURE CHEST<br/><br/>8 x 8 Board &amp; Storage<br/><br/>CHESSMEN<br/><br/>16 Black &amp; 16 White Wood Chess Pieces<br/><br/>ILIOS &amp; Capere are also available from Playford Games as standalone games.

        "description": "Trapped inside a house built by the insane Master of the Ceremony, you are challenged to a deadly game in which the prize is your survival. Your goal is to find the Exit, hidden among the various rooms of this labyrinth, and the two Keys you need to open it. Keys can be found by exploring the Halls, but if all else fails, there&rsquo;s always the option to take one out of&hellip; other participants! Each of you has a Key sewn into your body while you were sleeping, the macabre detail courtesy of the Master of the Ceremony, who watches your struggles using his cameras, and mixes up the playing field from afar&hellip; Only one of you can escape, the others will stay in the Halls &ndash; forever!<br/><br/>All Players declare their actions for the turn in secret, and then reveal them simultaneously. Players explore, search rooms to find weapons and other items that will increase their chances of survival, and fight one another for the ultimate prize - their life! Other participants are not their only concern, however, as the host of this bloody spectacle also directs a twisted Killer, more monster than man, who moves around the board in search of victims. At the end of each turn, the First Player momentarily takes on the role of the Master of the Ceremony, and, in addition to executing other effects that influence the game&rsquo;s board, needs to direct the Killer. Will you avoid him, or try to face him for the chance to grasp one of the Keys you need from his cold, dead hands? Just be warned, as the Killer might still take revenge from beyond the grave!<br/><br/>And if you perish? Well, you won&rsquo;t get to escape, but you can still play AS the Master of the Ceremony and make sure nobody else escapes, either. Choose cards from a wider selection and customize your approach. Will you close off rooms to make the board more cramped, forcing players to fight, or will you incentivize players with strategically placed Gifts? Who will the Killer target now that you have sole control of him? The weakest or the strongest participants?<br/><br/>Explore, search, fight or flee, find the Exit, gain the Keys and escape&hellip; or remain in the Halls of Horror forever! 2-4 players can go head-to-head in their bid for survival, and you can also face the challenge alone in the game&rsquo;s solo mode!<br/><br/>&mdash;description from the publisher<br/><br/>",

Skaven and Goblin teams are affectionately called the Underworld Denizens, and the Underworld Creepers are one of the most popular examples. The combination of players from both races joins the best of both worlds, spawning new strengths and eliminating old weaknesses to create something greater than the sum of its parts.<br/><br/>Goblin and Skaven players have little in common besides their size and subterranean homes, but as a team they can put together a winning combination of positions and players. They're a lot of fun to play and you'll enjoy a dizzying variety of fresh tactics and plays, whilst keeping your opponents on their toes.<br/><br/>This multipart plastic kit contains components from both the existing Goblin and Skaven team sets. You'll be able to build 6 unique Goblins with interchangeable heads, 3 Skaven Linemen, 1 Skaven Blitzer, 1 Skaven Thrower, and 1 Skaven Gutter Runner. Alongside the players, the set contains 3 Goblin and 3 Skaven balls, plus one of each team's tokens and turn markers! You'll also find an Underworld Denizens transfer sheet and 12 32mm Blood Bowl bases.<br/><br/>The rules to use Underworld Denizens teams in your games of Blood Bowl can be found in Spike! Journal Issue 9.<br/><br/>Key Features<br/>-You no longer have to choose between skittering Skaven and madcap Goblins<br/>-Mixed teams offer new challenges and fun modelling opportunities<br/>-Customise your team with both sets of balls, turn markers and coins<br/><br/>",

The inner city suburbs of Darlinghurst and Surrey Hills are a battleground between warring gangs led by prostitute Tilly Devine and sly grog queen Kate Leigh. And in the middle of it all is you, a detective for the New South Wales Police, just trying to solve the crimes and bring the perpetrators to justice.<br/><br/>Razorhurst is a story-driven detective game similar to Sherlock Holmes Consulting Detective. You will interview suspects, follow leads, and use your abilities for observation, persuasion and force. Razorhurst introduces a unique clock mechanic for affecting the player's abilities. But the main difference with other detective games is that in Razorhurst everything is real. You will be investigating actual crimes, tracking down historical evidence, and bringing actual killers to justice. Based on exhaustive research, Razorhurst allows the player to step back in time to one of the most heady and deadly places in history.<br/><br/>&mdash;description from the designer<br/><br/>",

Be that nobody and become a somebody.<br/><br/>Grimm World is a open-world card game set in the fairy tale world of the Brothers Grimm and the successor of Grim(m) World: First Steps. Here you play an ordinary person who sets out to experience adventure. The player is not told how his journey should look like. He is free to decide where he goes and what he wants to do. Maybe he wants to accumulate trade and wealth? Or does he want to make a name for himself as a bounty hunter? The world reacts and changes based on your decisions. Are you ready for this adventure?<br/><br/>Grimm World is based on the OWCS (Open World Card System). The OWCS is a system to simulate an Open World as a card game. An Encounter deck with multi-use cards serves as a random encounter, as an equipment deck, it triggers quests, dice rolls are simulated, it defines prices for trading and it simulates the time in the game world. An additional Storybook deck simulates the living world in this game. Depending on the time in the game, new missions appear or disappear, events happen or the world changes. Additionally, your own character can be leveled up and becomes stronger and stronger as the game progresses. Combats in this game are fought on a grid field laid out with cards. Your hand cards serve as life points and determine the character's possible actions during combat. The enemies are controlled by a simple card-based AI.<br/><br/>&mdash;description from the designer<br/><br/>",

Building on the The British Way, this new multipack allows players to explore variations in insurgent groups&rsquo; organizational structures, strategies, and relationship with civilians, across four insurgencies in Central and South America between 1968 and 1992. During this part of the Cold War era, Latin America experienced an incredible number of different insurgent groups, many inspired by the Cuban Revolution featured in Cuba Libre, ranging from popular backed rural insurgencies, flexible urban guerrillas, externally sponsored raiders, and brutal ideologically rigid groups. This multipack features a game exemplifying each of these types of insurgencies, to offer players the chance to compare different approaches to rebellion. The four games included in the multipack cover conflicts in Uruguay (1968-1972), Nicaragua (1979-1990), El Salvador (1979-1992), and Peru (1980-1992). The Nicaragua and El Salvador games can also be played in a linked campaign scenario, which combines them into a simultaneous side-by-side experience.<br/><br/>&mdash;description from the publisher<br/><br/>",

        "description": "Bable is a challenging cooperative card game where no one speaks your language.<br/>You build the mythical Tower of Babel together with your fellow players. However, you may not perform any actions during your turn; instead you have to give orders to other players. Meanwhile, your languages are slowly changing, making it increasingly difficult to understand each other.<br/><br/>Players work together by giving each other commands.<br/>While building, their languages slowly change, making it increasingly harder to understand each others commands. Do the players manage to construct the tower before the chaos is complete?<br/><br/>The goal in Bable is to complete building the tower before they run out of actions. Players construct the tower in 4 distinct Layers, containing (from bottom to top) 4, 3, 2 and 1 Building cards. Players must complete each Layer before its corresponding Idea deck runs out.<br/><br/>Players always have 4 actions in hand (build, draw, give and reveal) that help construct the tower. The actions are referred to by their symbols, as the words associated to the actions will change during the game. Players are not allowed to perform actions on their own turn. Instead, on their turn they give assignments to other players to perform actions. An important actions is the build action, which allows a player to place a Building card in the tower if they pay the associated cost in Materials.<br/><br/>&mdash;description from the designer<br/><br/>",

        "description": "Do-To-Ho Table Hockey is completely different from other table hockey games. The play figures are not fastened to rods, but are mobile on the whole playing field. In their bases just like in the puck there is a ball bearing, so they slide like ice skate runners all over the board. Moving a play figure is done via a short, unique knock against the figure with a small stick as in the case for billiard. The play courses take place alternating, there are 'attack courses', with which the puck may be played by a play figure, and 'position courses' (defense courses as well as offside release courses), with which a play figure only may change position without touching the puck. Puck possession changes, if the aggressor misses the puck or hits an opposing play figure. Do-To-Ho was developed in Germany and published in 1994. Until now (2007) there are about 200 exemplars, all handmade. The antecessor of Do-To-Ho was Stahlkugelhockey (=Iron Ball Hockey), developed by the same author in 1980.

Although you can play it with any amount of players, and any amount of models, it&rsquo;s usually with around fifteen models each, and features a model-by-model playing system.<br/><br/>&quot;Each player takes turns to activate one of their models, in whatever order they choose. When a Captain (the leader of the force) or Hero (the minor characters) are activated the controlling player may activate a number of other models at the same time if they wish to do so. Up to six friendly models within 6&rdquo; of the Captain or Hero&rsquo;s base may be activated, performing their actions immediately as normal. In this way a player may co-ordinate their troops to attack their foes in waves but it comes at a price. Activating your models in larger groups can leave your opponent free reign at the end of the turn if all your models have acted.<br/><br/>&quot;Other unique aspects of ArcWorlde are smaller &ldquo;side-quests&rdquo; within the main game itself. These are entirely optional, and by no means an essential component of the ArcWorlde game, but they add flavour and fun if the players so wish! There are Forgotten Tombs, where the player can delve inside to uncover lost treasure, or terrible evil. There are the Epic Duels, where ANY of the models on the board can engage in mighty combat, fighting to the death for glory and prestige. There are many more work-in-progress side quests, which will be added to the rulebook if the Kickstarter does as well as I hope!<br/><br/>",

Your job is to brew and sell beer, keep your kegs from being empty through price and availability swings in the ingredients (barley, hops, and yeast) market, as well as through swings in customer preferences in the marketplace.<br/><br/>In this 18 card solitaire game, beers are brewed by using cash earned by selling beer to buy ingredients. Through randomization of ingredient pricing and customer preferences by dice rolling or by rotating and flipping cards, cash is earned and spent brewing and selling beers, which are tracked on the ale and lager kegs. Track beer volumes, cash, customer preferences, ingredient volumes and prices, etc. on the cards using numbers printed around the outside edges of the cards, rotated so that the current number is on top, and by laying one card on another, using markers lines on the bottom card.<br/><br/>When ingredients run out, the market is refreshed. The game ends when the market has been refreshed 5 times or both kegs are empty at the end of a turn.

Just line up the short edge or long edge of any of these maps to any other map in the series to create your own Forward Edge of the Battle Area.<br/><br/>What would maps be without scenarios? Two monster-sized scenarios are included for the monster-sized Fulda Gap configuration, our largest scenarios to date, using many formations and optional Battalion/Regimental Activation rules, also included in this Map Pack -<br/><br/>The Breakthrough to Frankfurt<br/>Almost a division of Soviet armor presses home its advantage in the final drive to reach the Main River crossings on their way to the Rhine!<br/><br/>Hold the Damn Line!<br/>NATO armored reserves find themselves finally in a position of strength to attempt a major counterattack into the onrushing Warsaw Pact hordes.

        "description": "Lost My Mummy is a two player, set collection game. You are racing your opponent to find your mummies by collecting information about them. This could be the canopic jar, the embalming material, the amulet, or even a death wish. This information is depicted on the cards and these are what you collect over the course of the game.<br/><br/>However, the main dynamic of the game are the dice. These are all bespoke dice that slow up an opponent or speed you up in your race to collect the cards that you need. They have low, medium or high numbers on them and this determines the range of choice that you have to select cards on your turn. Once found, you can then collect the reward for your found Mummy. The player with the most reward money, wins!<br/><br/>This family-friendly game plays at a number of levels, from simple enjoyable gameplay to more complex strategies to win! Over time, players develop a better understanding about how to find their mummies in the quickest time.<br/><br/>The artwork is very detailed and allows for children to really explore the area of Egyptian mummification. They are actively learning about a period of history, without actually realising the information is going in! This is the power of this little card game.<br/><br/>&mdash;description from the publisher<br/><br/>",

        "description": "Tang Garden with all Expansions (Golden Age, Ghost Stories and Seasons and every other Promo).<br/><br/>The Tang dynasty was considered the first golden age of the classical and now iconic Chinese gardens. Emperor Xuanzong built the magnificent imperial Garden of the Majestic Clear Lake as an homage of life itself and from where he ruled. Players will act as Imperial Garden Designers and they will be called to build the most incredible garden while balancing the elements of Nature.<br/><br/>Tang Garden is a Zen-like game that will take you to the first golden age of China, where players will progressively build a garden by creating the landscape, placing the scenery and projecting their vision through vertical panoramas. During the construction, noblemen will visit the garden to admire the surroundings and the way the natural elements coexist in the most breathtaking scenery humankind has ever laid their eyes upon.<br/><br/>Players will take turns by playing one of the two actions available in the game:<br/><br/>1) Placing tiles and matching the elements to increase their personal nature balance and unlock more character miniatures.<br/><br/>By balancing the nature elements on the player boards, players will attract new characters into the garden. On each player turn, if the elements are balanced, the player will have to choose one miniature from the ones available and finally decide which one of the characters will be placed in the garden, orienting them towards their favorite background, while keeping the other with you to keep exploiting its ability.<br/><br/>2) Draw decoration cards and place one on the board to get prestige by completing collections.<br/><br/>Players will draw a quantity of cards based on the board situation and choose one to keep. Players will then have to place the chosen decoration in one of the available spots in the garden, creating a unique and seamless scenario that will never be the same.<br/><br/>During the game, by placing tiles on special parts of the board, you will be able to place a panorama tile, a new element that adds a never ending perspective for the visitors. Both small and big panoramas will be placed perpendicularly to the board by attaching it to the board insert by creating a seamless look on the four sides of the board. The Panoramas will interact with the characters at the end of the game by giving prestige points based on what your visitor sees and likes.<br/><br/>At the end of the game, the player with the most prestige will be the winner.<br/><br/>&mdash;description from the publisher<br/><br/>",

To leave the shelter of the cities is to brave the Ash Wastes &ndash; a massive expanse of polluted and desolate dunes inhabited by outcasts, prospectors, and those who have adapted to life in these harsh environments. Gangs are often employed to protect caravans and convoys when commerce between the hive cities is necessary, and the nomads of the wastes prey on them for both sustenance and sport.<br/><br/>In Necromunda, you'll take control of a vicious gang, building them up from green recruits to hardened veterans as they claw their way to power through bitterly-fought skirmishes with their rivals. Necromunda: Ash Wastes takes the action out of the claustrophobic and dangerous sprawl of the hive cities, and into the agoraphobic and deadly wastelands. This box provides you with two gangs, including mounted units, a set of modular habs, and a gaming mat to fight over, plus the rules and gaming accessories you&rsquo;ll need to start playing right away.

You take on the role of an investor in various train companies trying to make the most money over fifteen turns. You'll roll dice and assign them to three different actions as you invest in companies, auction off trains, and build track to develop your train network. In this sequel, you're also competing with a Rival who will buy shares and make investments to compete with your score. Can you earn more points than the Rival?<br/><br/>Each turn of Rollway Station 2, you roll 6 dice. You must then assign these dice to three different actions: buying a share in a company, laying track, and bidding on a train. The values of the dice determine the specific effect of each action, and you'll rarely get everything you want. After you've taken your turn, there will be one die left over which is used by the Rival, who will either compete with you for shares in valuable companies, or make their own investments in private companies. Every few rounds, all the trains run and you score points based on how good their routes are, but so does the Rival.

        "description": "This is 1985. This is World War III. But this is not your typical World War III.<br/><br/>There are many accurate-to-the-underwear-brand World War III games to choose from, and the ones that I have played are quite good. This, however, is not one of them. Although The Long Road flirts with reality, it&rsquo;s not ready to move in and live with it. This game has a twist. From the moment I designed World at War: Eisenbach Gap I envisioned a war that was something else, a war that was predicated by something other than oil or warm-water ports or ill-defined land grabs. A war instigated by powers without geographical affiliation, powers unknown to us.<br/><br/>The agents of those powers might be nothing more than a special ops team of mysterious origin sent to assassinate a world leader, nothing more than a militia, ambushing foreigners raping their mother country; nothing other than normal. Then again, they might be other than normal, or&mdash;by definition&mdash;paranormal.<br/><br/>So that is the twist, a wargame with paranormal elements. Make no mistake, I&rsquo;ve strived to make this an accessible, yet accurate wargame. Included is everything from advanced sights, multi-spectral smoke, artillery-delivered minefields, to electronic counter measures, anti-tank guided missiles, attack helicopters and the man-portable, air defense systems required to bring them down. You&rsquo;ll command the weapons of the time; Abrams tanks, T-80 tanks, M60A3, T-64B, and Sheridan tanks. Bradleys, M-113s, BMPs, infantry, spetsnaz, and more.<br/><br/>But of course, war isn&rsquo;t won by equipment; war is won by soldiers. In The Long Road soldiers&rsquo; training and morale is integral to the game, integral to combat resolution. But even more important than the rank and file grunts are the heroes. The men and woman who can - turn the tide of battle. We&rsquo;ve included them too. People like Mike Hudson, Colonel Adrik Aleksandrov Shabalin, tank commander Sergeant Matt Dahl, and Commissar Colonel Elena Petrova. Heroic humans, but humans nonetheless.<br/><br/>But there is something more. Somethings that are not &quot;humans nonetheless.&quot; Demons that summon electrical storms, rendering advanced weaponry nearly useless, Lycan clans that fight with assault rifles, RPDs, and RPGs, as well as the fang and claw of their elders. A witch with an agenda, plus the powerful spells to make it happen, and of course, Katarina Ubirek; an amoral Romanian vampire worth dozens of inexperienced soldiers in combat. You know those things that you have read about, watched in movies, heard about on horror podcasts? Well, in The Long Road they are real.<br/><br/>But not every scenario contains nightmares. Sometimes you&rsquo;ll fight with/against/in spite of these paranormal beings, yet often your battle will be about nothing more than depleted uranium rounds, reactive armor, maneuver, and massed fires. In fact, we include a separate scenario book in the game titled Long Road Tactics that includes nothing but historical, for lack of a better word, scenarios.<br/><br/>So that is The Long Road; part military horror, part authentic recreation of World War III, but all fun. We hope you enjoy it.<br/><br/>Coming to Kickstarter soon!<br/><br/>Each copy of The Long Road includes.<br/><br/>&middot;        5 sheets of thick (2mm thick), large (1&quot; square, large) counters.<br/><br/>&middot;        3 MOUNTED 17&rdquo; x 22&rdquo; map geomorphic boards. Not paper, not stiff cardboard, but rather 2mm-thick, wrapped and backed mounted game boards.5 sheets of thick (2mm thick), large (1&quot; square, large) counters.<br/><br/>&middot;        27 full-color Action Cards.

        "description": "Naval Thunder: Clash of Dreadnoughts is an exciting, fast paced miniatures game of World War I naval combat. Its first in an exciting line of naval wargames from Steel Dreadnought Games and is designed for use with miniatures of scales 1/1800 - 1/6000.  Newcomers will appreciate how straight-forward and easy to learn the basic system is, while naval wargaming veterans can take advantage of the optional rule system to add additional detail to the game.<br/><br/>NT: CoD has been designed from the keel up to be fun, fast paced, and full of flavor so that you can focus on the thrill of commanding a ship or fleet at sea instead of tedious charts or calculations.  A battle involving a dozen battleships and battlecruisers on each side can be fought to a conclusion in a couple hours while offering a play experience with significant tactical depth.<br/><br/>The robust optional rules system allows the game to grow with you as you gain experience - ensuring that Naval Thunder will be your naval miniatures system of choice for years to come.  There are more than 20 completely modular optional rules that allow you to model historically accurate factors influencing naval combat of the era.  You can pick and choose which rules to include allowing you to tailor the pace of play and level of detail to your personal preference.<br/><br/>Just a few examples of the kinds of historically accurate details you can add to the game include:<br/><br/><br/>     Poor design of British shells causing them to shatter on striking heavy armor<br/>     Poor cordite flash precautions<br/>     The impact of historical commanders<br/>     Crew training levels<br/>     The influence of wind direction on gunnery<br/>     Using submarines to soften up your opponent's battlefleet<br/><br/><br/>Optional shortcuts allow you to use Naval Thunder: Clash of Dreadnoughts to run huge fleet actions such as Jutland in a fraction of time other non-abstract systems would take.<br/><br/>Included with the rules are data cards for 80 classes of ship, representing hundreds of historical vessels, allowing you to model nearly any action between the Royal Navy and Kaiserliche Marine during the first world war.<br/><br/>",

The archaeologists will move through the desert according to what we roll on the archaeologists die (8-sided die).<br/><br/>The desert is represented in 6 board modules that have an A and a B side, so the faces could be interchanged so that each game is different. The path to Nassor is made up of 96 squares, but if we use the shortcuts available on the map well, the journey will be shorter.<br/><br/>In addition to all the difficulties that the desert has prepared for us on our way, you will also have to be careful with the other archaeologists, since they will be able to capture you and send you to the previous town where you have been  as well as Nassor's guardians, who  will be lurking throughout the game for their own route hidden in the dense jungle, and if we coincide with them in adjacent squares, they will capture the archaeologists sending them to the dungeon.<br/><br/>In order to survive and advance in the desert, the players will seek to fall with their archaeologists in the long-awaited power boxes, which will grant us one of the forty existing powers in the deck, all of them different, to use for our benefit or to harm the others. other players.  To end the game, you must reach the final square with your two archaeologists, at which point you officially declare yourself the discoverer of the golden city of Nassor and the winner of the game.<br/><br/>-description from publisher<br/><br/>",

        "description": "Miniature rules for wargaming tactical level combat from 450 AD to 1500 AD.<br/><br/>Medieval Warfare (MW) was awarded GAMA's Best Historical Miniatures Rules of 1998 at Origins 1999.<br/><br/>The scale is 1 figure equals 20 men, with 1 inch equals 25 yards (for 15mm figures). One turn equals 5-10 minutes. An army divides into a number of Battles (Divisions), each Battle commanded by a general.<br/><br/>Units contain a number of stands.<br/><br/>MW contains a large amount of research into Army lists: 93 are in the back of the rules, from Late Patrician Roman (mid 5th Century) to Burgundian Ordinance (late 15th century). These are presented in WRG 7th style, with unit name, type, weapons, and purchase points. Four scenarios are also in the rules.<br/><br/>The sequence of play consists of Recovery (Rally phase), placing tactical orders, conducting movement, missile fire, and melee.<br/><br/>For command, a commander receives between 3 and 5 orders, depending on his competence. These can be assigned in the second phase of each turn--you receive a choice of 6 orders (charge, move, hold, defend, retire, and recover). Unlike the random pip system, the number remains a constant each turn, rather than a random number from 1 to 6.<br/><br/>MW contains two kinds of movement: strategic and tactical. Strategic occurs when units are beyond 12&quot; of the enemy--they receive additional movement of between 25% to 100% more, depending on the unit. However, they cannot come closer than 12&quot;. Again, this is similar to march movement in WRG 7th--although a lot more restricted.<br/><br/>Tactical is just that. When you want to close, you must use the slower tactical movement. For example, armored and close order infantry move 4 inches, loose order move 6 inches, and so on.<br/><br/>Terrain can slow your move. When charging and routing, each unit receives a random move amount.<br/><br/>For example, close order armored infantry go 1 inch plus an &quot;averaging&quot; die roll (2-5) for a total of 3-6 inches. Defenders have the option to counter charge.<br/><br/>There are several times during a turn, for example, such as charging and counter charging, when morale tests are necessary. This is a d10 roll, with various modifiers. If you fail by a little, not much happens. Fail by a lot and suffer extreme consequences.<br/><br/>Missile fire is by stand, with a d10 random roll.<br/><br/>Melee uses an &quot;averaging die&quot; (2-5) to which modifiers are added and then multiplied by the number of stands. The resulting number is divided by 10 to get the number of casualties. When a unit receives a number of casualties equal to the number of figures on a stand, the stand is removed.<br/><br/>When you lose 1/3 of your troops, it's morale check time for everyone. And then every time you lose a unit, more morale checks.<br/><br/>The game ends when a general either concedes defeat or all his troops run away or are destroyed.<br/><br/>",

Play as one of four unique factions and assemble your crew of defenders from a wide range of animal characters to resist the machines across a modular map that changes with each game.<br/><br/>War has come to the Wild. For millennia, animals have weathered shifting alliances and the cycle of the seasons&mdash;but they&rsquo;ve never faced an enemy like this. An army of machines powered by corrupted magic is rampaging across the woodlands, enclosing everything in its path and exploiting the warmth of the world. Across the marshes, plains, mountains, and forests, scrappy crews of defenders rise up to resist the machine occupation. The partisans hail from four factions, each determined to fight back in their own way: the Council with its fortitude and bread, the Order with its wisdom of the flame, the Sect with its ingenious inventions, and the Coven with its spells and subterfuge.<br/><br/>Players assemble their crews by drawing defender cards that each correspond with a faction and a habitat type. Each card details a unique animal character that enables that player to take various actions such as moving, clearing pollution, fighting mechs, building camps, and healing across a modular illustrated hex map. Different combinations of defender cards from different factions allow for varied strategies and approaches to achieving objectives and fighting the machines. A machine deck controls the expansion of the machines and their development across the board. As the machines enclose habitats, they build factories and send out hunter mechs while leaving behind a trail of walls and pollution. If players can successfully build all of their camps and rewild the machines' factories before the last factory is built, all players win the game together.<br/><br/>Can the Defenders band together to heal the land and outsmart a seemingly impossible enemy? Or will the woodlands succumb to an endless industrial winter? It&rsquo;s up to you and your comrades to decide.<br/><br/>&mdash;description from the designer<br/><br/>",

        "description": "The Bible contains prophecies about the final days, describing how the armies of the World will fight the final battle and that without divine intervention, no life shall be saved (Matthew 24: 22). Certain Biblical scholars have described how closely these prophecies correlate to our modern times and put forward scenarios for this climactic battle.<br/><br/>The Battle of Armageddon is a 2 to 6 player game dealing with this final battle. The game brings together the forces of the World into the ultimate battle for control of the Earth.<br/><br/>The 17 x 33&quot; game map represents the battleground, stretching from Egypt to Iran. The 216 5/8&quot; counters (die-cut and back-printed) represent the armies of Israel, the Arabs, Magog (Russia), the Revived Roman Empire (Europe), USA and the Kings of the East (China). The 144 playing cards capture apocalyptic events (7 seals, 7 trumpets, 7 vials), special powers (e.g. the Anitchrist, Gog of Magog, etc.), nuclear weapons (tactical, theatre, and strategic) and homeland populations.  Battle dice are used to resolve all battles.<br/><br/>Players maneuver their armies across the map and resolve battles using the battle dice.  Event cards are drawn each turn, giving players special powers or weapons of mass destruction, but they can also bring on apocalyptic events.  Utlimately, the player who best manages the chaos and controls Jerusalem at the end of the game wins!<br/><br/>Note that this version of game The Battle of Armageddon is a significant departure from the original game published in 1999. In line with other main stream games, The Battle of Armageddon provides a simple but challenging game system suitable for both seasoned and casual players. Players are forced to adjust their strategy depending on rapidly changing conditions as dictated by the event cards. Combat is bloody, yet managed quickly and decisively through the battle dice. Players must manipulate allies and opponents to achieve the goal of capturing the Holy Land.<br/><br/>",

The big amount of shares all investment companies buy and sell causes fluctuations in the stock market, but be aware! When players start to dump their shares, it could cause The Big Crash! Which player will handle the market the best and will earn the most money?<br/><br/>It's now possible to buy any stock you want (up to 3 per round) and sell any stock you want, so you will have more control. The bidding system is still present, but this time you will bid for turn order. Also the market shifts on the amount of stocks sold or bought.<br/><br/>",

From the three cards, just based on the images, you choose one path to reject, one path to postpone, and one path to go. The path you have taken is then revealed - you turn the card, read the story, make some decisions according to the text and apply the eventual changes, losses, or gains to your character sheet or just a piece of paper. This way you build your fate of a medieval pilgrim-hero and you try to survive the whole journey to the bottom of the &quot;your future&quot; deck. There are fights, NPCs, equipment, and many more... just as in a gamebook (a very grim &amp; dark one, full of odd meetings) but there is no dice rolling, everything depends on your decisions and on the path you had gone before. For the next play, you will possibly remember what image hides what kind of event or fight, so you may choose your path wiser, according to your current equipment, and fitness.<br/><br/>&mdash;description from the publisher<br/><br/>",

Like all characters in Robinson Crusoe, there is both a male and female side. This survivor is different from those in the base game. They have no invention, using only their wiles and tricks to help the party succeed.<br/><br/>The available actions are as follows:<br/><br/>Dummy Player: &quot;I'm surprised how easy this is!'&quot; Discard 3(D) to gain Brown/Grey Action pawn this turn.<br/><br/>AC Bonus: &quot;Never count your money while you're sitting at the table.&quot; Spend 2(D) to ignore one wound when hunting.<br/><br/>Cheat: &quot;I will do the right thing, once I've exhausted all alternatives.&quot; After resolving an Adventure card effect, spend 3(D) to NOT shuffle it into the Event deck, and discard it.<br/><br/>Go Fish: &quot;I suggest a new alternative. Let the island win.&quot; Spend 3(D) to draw two Mystery cards. Resolve only the first Treasure from the drawn cards. Discard the rest.<br/><br/>Rules for the Sailor:<br/>The sailor is a great swimmer. He can discard two determination tokens to ignore river tiles when calculating distance on the island.<br/><br/>The sailor has a treasure map. For three determination tokens, he can take a special gathering action once on an island tile with a totem icon. If successful, the Sailor draws a mystery card, resolving only a trap or a treasure. This ability may only be used once per tile, even if the tile has more than one totem icon.<br/><br/>The sailor has some tricks to conserve food. For 2 determination tokens, he can change one food into one non-perishable food.<br/><br/>The sailor is also tough. He can discard 1 determination token to re-roll an injury die (brown, grey or green).<br/><br/>",

The Japanese defenders were dug into well-entrenched underground bunkers and natural cave systems on the island, and even though the Americans had numerical, logistical and aerial supremacy, a high price was paid for the hard-won victory. In the iconic photo of the six Marines raising a flag over Mount Suribachi, three were killed in action days after, testament to the ferocity of the fighting.<br/><br/>Warfighter WWII Expansion - #53 Iwo Jima  presents new subterranean locations with close-quarter impediments (such as locked doors and booby traps), along with new soldiers and skills focussed on built-up area combat, reflecting the indomitable fortitude of the US Marines over the five-week campaign as they rooted out the enemy from tunnels and holes.<br/><br/>This set adds 56 cards to your Warfighter WWII Missions!

The lava cooled to form a terraced landscape and with time the island became inhabited by people. Kingdoms emerged in the three corners of the island, all there to extract noble metals from the lava.<br/>Today, the kingdoms are ruled by the Queens of Copper and Gold and the King of Silver. Alchemists have settled on the misty shores. Alchemists have the ability to transmute the gold, silver and copper into magic pearls. The kingdoms send out messengers to get magic pearls made by the alchemists and to bring them back to the kingdom. All the messengers wear rings made from the noble metals. They&rsquo;re on the move day and night, exchanging the rings among themselves as alchemists require two different metals in order to make a magic pearl. It is therefore customary on Magic Triland to carry out trades by bartering at every encounter. A kingdom possessing magic pearls, possesses the highest wisdom and magical power.<br/><br/>User summary:<br/>The game is played on a board with hexagonal blocks of different heights, that form a different board every time. Each player has to pawns with rings (metals), that come in each players color. He moves his pieces using cards covering the height difference between the blocks. Exchanging rings between players when playing pieces meet, enable a player to collect pearls along the side of the board. First player to bring home a pearl of the color opposite to his starting hexagon wins the game<br/><br/>",

        "description": "El Reba&ntilde;o is not a usual card game... You&rsquo;ll have to go around the table while bleating like a sheep, howl out loud while the rest of the players hide or be the shepherd that calls out the flock, so all the sheep go running towards him&hellip; It sounds crazy, right?<br/><br/>The aim of the game is to get rid of your cards. You play a card from your stack in the center of the table and then the turn will follow depending on the card played: Is it a coloured sheep card? The player with that colour will play the next card. Is it a special card like the wolf, the shepherd or the dog? The players will have to perform the action... It might even get dark and nobody will know which colour is for a while! Stay alert in the pen, don&rsquo;t make any mistake, or you&rsquo;ll get all the cards from the center of the table!<br/><br/>El Reba&ntilde;o is an active, fast reaction card game for the whole flock at home!<br/><br/><br/>El Reba&ntilde;o no es un juego de cartas como los dem&aacute;s... &iquest;En qu&eacute; juego tienes que dar vueltas a una mesa balando como una oveja? &iquest;O dar un largo aullido mientras los dem&aacute;s se esconden? &iquest;O que tenga turnos salteados? Por no decir que tienes que hacer de pastor, irte de la mesa y llamar al resto de las ovejas para que acudan corriendo hacia ti. &iquest;Te parecen suficientes razones para probar &quot;El Reba&ntilde;o&quot;?<br/><br/>Cada jugador tendr&aacute; que deshacerse de su mont&oacute;n de cartas de la mano antes que los dem&aacute;s. Las cartas se juegan de una en una sobre la mesa, pero los turnos van saltando, ya que el siguiente jugador en jugar una carta ser&aacute; el jugador que sea del color de la oveja jugada. Pero a veces en vez de ovejas salen perros pastores (que inician duelos), lobos (que aullan), flores (para com&eacute;rselas), el rpopio pastor (que llama al reba&ntilde;o y&eacute;ndose de la mesa de juego) y hasta se hace de noche (no sabiendo durante un rato que color eres). El primer jugador en quedarse sin cartas ganar&aacute; la partida.<br/><br/>",

You'll use inspiration, seek fortune and hobnob with aristocrats to perform musical masterpieces and achieve your legacy in this engine building game for 1-4 players. Get inspired by your rivals' performances to create your own works of genius as the game builds to a crescendo.<br/><br/>Each turn, players choose one of four actions: Seek Inspiration, Seek Fortune, Seek Patronage, or Perform. Inspiration is your primary resource and it comes in three tones - Joy, Passion and Sorrow. Seeking inspiration allows you to gain your resource while all of the other actions will have players spend inspiration to acquire cards. Fortune cards help build your engine, which can allow you to gain bonus actions on your turn. Patron cards can also help build your engine or can give you bonus legacy points for end game scoring. Chamber Music and Concert Music cards give you lots of legacy points, but every time you perform, your opponents can attend your performance and gain inspiration. You will not only have a special ability as your specific composer, but you are also the only person who can compose your very own Magnum Opus. Complete specific goals to gain Maestro cards and end the game.<br/><br/>Compose your masterpiece. Secure your legacy.<br/><br/>&mdash;description from the designer<br/><br/>",

It was played on a swatch of ornamental cloth familiar to this day as a &quot;plaid&quot;. Instead of stones used in the traditional game, this variation presented here uses dice as the playing pieces.<br/><br/>To win at Breacan - and thus resolve the dispute in your favor, you must be the first to weave a path from one side of the Breacan to the opposite side.<br/><br/>Placing the dice<br/>On your turn, place two of your four rolled dice. After your turn has ended, two more dice will be automatically rolled to replace the two you rolled.<br/><br/>Dice can be placed in two ways:<br/>1. They can be placed on a square of your own color (e.g. red on red) when that square has no vertical or horizontal neighbors.<br/>2. They can be placed on any square as long as each adjacent (horizontally or vertically) neighboring die of your color is either one higher or one lower than the die being placed. Note: 6 can be placed next to a 1 and 1 next to a 6.<br/><br/>Winning<br/>The first player to complete a path from top to bottom or from side to side is the winner.<br/><br/>",

So what these rules celebrate is the honor and bravery of men who fought for lost reasons in remote and alien lands and the courage of men who attempted to save a doomed and, in some cases, brutish way of life.<br/><br/>It also commemorates some of the kindest, meanest, most charitable, most selfish, bravest, most craven, brightest and most incorrigibly ignorant people that have ever walked the earth: the Victorian on a mission, the Calif with murder in his heart, the merciless Zulu, the totally mad Gordon confronting the equally mad Mahdi.

Legend tells of their encounters with conceited dragons, evil witches, ferocious giants, terrifying wights, and not forgetting the fickle but powerful Fair Folk.

You will fulfil hazardous quests in your search for fame and fortune, whilst trying to prevent your rivals from doing the same. Love, war, luck, and clever diplomacy all play a part as the game unfolds. Mabinogion is a Welsh word meaning ʻstories of heroesʼ, and many heroic adventures await you in the game. So take a journey back to the Dark Ages and live amongst the legend, myth, and romance of ancient Wales!<br/><br/>",

The game is designed to be played by 2 or more people, although solitaire play is still very possible.<br/><br/>Players select the maneuver that their aircraft will perform from a maneuver schedule unique to each aircraft. Once all the players have revealed their maneuvers, players move their aircraft and then the shooting begins.<br/><br/>The game provides for the use of air/flight stands to be used with miniatures, and is played on a hexmat large enough to hold several aircraft at a time. When planes are damaged, they are marked with either counters or specially made clips resembling smoke or fire.<br/><br/>The Warbirds in Miniature Rules package comes with a 34 page rulebook, 2 double sided sets of charts, 2 double sided sample aircraft sheets, and a CD with over 50 Aircraft sheets covering all the major combat aircraft flown in World War 2. The CD also includes some early Jets for later World War 2 and for use in Korean War scenarios.<br/><br/>",

        "description": "One Bullet, One German covers the Polish uprising in Warsaw and the military operations in the immediately envi-rons east of the city in August, 1944. It was critical time for the German: not only was there the Warsaw Uprising to con-tend with, but a few miles east of the city, the German panzers were reeling back from a massive Red onslaught. The only up-side for the German was their keen ability to multitask with weakened forces. The Russians had their own set of problems. The onslaught had created directional problems as their armies approached the Vistula River. Because of this, their strength was divided. Many forces were ordered to seize bridgeheads across this key river south of Warsaw. Others were ordered to move along the Vistula north to Warsaw, still others, simply advance westward. The Russian forces were fast approaching the end of their supply chain after advancing hundreds of miles. Their tanks had also taken a toll from combat and breakdowns. All units had arrived in the area of Warsaw in a tired and weakened state.<br/><br/>The main reason for the Polish uprising was to seize the bridges and portions of Praga, the east part of the city east of the Vistula. It was hoped that the Russian forces would meet them there and cleanse the area of Germans. This is what the game covers: the Uprising and the last panzer victory a few miles east of the city where the 3rd Tank Corps&rsquo; was ripped apart by the withdrawing panzers!<br/><br/>The map scale is about 400 yards per hex on the Warsaw map and 1 mile on the East of Warsaw map. Each combat unit is a battalion unless otherwise designated. A game turn represents 4 days of time. Each Polish resistance fighter unit is around 500 men. The game uses a modified system used in ATO's Into the Beartrap game.<br/><br/>Two 11x17&quot; maps, over 300 counters. Rules cover: Unit Activation, Random Events, Polish Ammo Limitations, Sewer Movement, Air Units, Close Assault, Divisional\\Corps Integrity, Using &quot;Karl&quot;, Barricades, Snipers, Rubble, Airdrops and more!<br/>Map scale: 400 yards per hex (Warsaw map), 1 mile per hex (East of Warsaw map)<br/>Unit scale: Battalion <br/>Time scale: 4 days a turn<br/><br/>",

Your opponent&rsquo;s competing troops will cause you to tangle and engage in conflict taking on causalities and slowing your pace to victory. You must anticipate the other players&rsquo; strategies by moving with precision and seizing the initiative. Sometimes your position is defensive to block an opponent from an objective and other times you are invading occupied regions to weaken the offensive of another player.<br/><br/>The game mechanics are based in mathematics and game theory, which provides an additional opponent. If you plan optimally, you will not only defeat the other players, but you will also solve the game with a minimal number of movements.<br/><br/>Divide and Conquer is played with 2-4 players of all ages with play lasting 30-45 minutes.<br/><br/>Home Page: <a target='_blank' href=\"http://www.divideandconquergame.com\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer noopener\">http://www.divideandconquergame.com</a><br/><br/>",

A player may use a variety of characters, each with an unique ability, to travel to new lands, form alliances, and fight duels. This innovative card game uses each part of the card for different plays, even the backs!<br/><br/>In Conquest the card game, the object is to be the first player to capture the majority of landmarks.  Players are dealt 5 cards.  There are 9 landmarks in the game.  Players can set the length and difficulty of the game at the start by choosing 3, 5, 7, or 9 landmarks or choosing landmarks that are more difficult to reach.  Players move to different landmarks by playing cards from their hand that match the combination of terrain icons on each landmark card.<br/><br/>Each player assumes the role of one of 15 characters who may travel to different landmarks to try to take possession of them or duel opponent&rsquo;s character.  Players may also form alliances to avoid being attacked with the added bonus of getting the opportunity to secretly buy the allied player&rsquo;s land.  Some of the characters include samurai, pirate, spy, witch, and ninja.  Each character has a unique ability that players can use to gain an advantage.<br/><br/>Players also control armies and officers that can battle to take over other player&rsquo;s landmarks.<br/><br/>Conquest is not a CCG.  It is a complete game with a deck of 63 cards, however, because each card can be used in multiple ways, it feels more like a deck of 200.  Each corner on the face of the cards represents a different aspect of the game:  characters, alliances, armies or terrain.  On the back of each card is a mythological beast which is used to resolve duels between characters.<br/><br/>The game includes 63 cards representing:<br/><br/>15 characters (including 4 officers)<br/> 3 mythological beasts (dragon, unicorn, minotaur)<br/> 4 alliances  (eagle, elephant, lion, bear)<br/> 4 terrain types (mountains, forest, desert, river)<br/>12 shield markers<br/>27 army cards<br/> 9 landmarks<br/><br/>",

        "description": "From the Introduction (Edited):<br/><br/>The intent behind the game is to provide a set of skirmish rules (one-on-one combat between characters) streamlined enough that games can be played to a satisfactory conclusion.  In a suitalbly brief amount of time, with considerably more figures than the usual fantasy role-playing game encounter.  In many ways, this is a military adjunct to a Middle Aesopian role-playing campaign, allowing the players to engage in actions larger than a simple dungeon crawl.  Even though the basic rules are bare-boned and straightforward in order to help achieve these ends, they provide a solid foundation for the addition of house-rules and additional material.<br/><br/>Although its roots go back a long way, the mythos of Middle Aesopia is a living story that contines to grow on the Skirmisher interactive forum and in it's soon to be released Quactica role-playing game.<br/><br/>Publisher Blurb:<br/><br/>Quactica: Battles for the Soul of Middle Aesopia was one of the new products Skirmisher released at Gen Con 2008 in Indianapolis. This innovative set of miniatures rules was created by veteran game designer and miniatures sculptor Steve Lortz, author of the famous Perilous Encounters rules released by Chaosium in 1978. Set in a world inhabited by various races of anthropomorphic animals - including Ducks, Dwargs, and Porks - the Quactica rules tie in with a beautiful line of miniatures created by Lortz and produced by Skirmisher Publishing LLC.<br/><br/>",

The challenge is to overpower the other players without drawing too much attention to yourself. Manage your defenses and economy as you make and break alliances to come out on top.<br/><br/>SAVAS is easy to learn and rich with player interaction. Start with a humble hand of 6 to 10 cards, and, if you keep your wits sharp, you might survive. Hold on tight, because in this game you will need every card your deck can spare to bring down your opponents!<br/><br/>In SAVAS, the goal is to destroy your opponents&rsquo; cards, and be the last man standing. Gather your forces, but choose wisely: only cards of the same color may attack each other. Everything in the game is upgradeable, from how fast you draw cards to how large of an attack force you can muster. Get 3+ people playing, and a whole new realm of diplomacy enters the field, much more dangerous than any card. Average game length is 30 minutes.  1 deck per person. Includes 3 decks!<br/><br/>(From the publisher)<br/><br/>",

        "description": "Wargames Rules for Entire Battles. From Earliest History to 1400 AD.<br/><br/>A miniatures game for ancient and medieval warfare. The rules use interesting game mechanics, such as random movement rates, to represent the variable nature of warfare in the era it addresses.<br/><br/>Units are rated by a Unit Cohesion Value (UCV) that takes into account the armor, leadership, and training of the unit. For example, Roman legionaries would have a high UCV due to their better equipment, good leadership, and regular training while barbarian tribesmen would have a lower UCV.<br/><br/>Combat is divided into shooting, impact, and melee. Unit's abilities are divided into strengths and weaknesses in these areas. For example, a barbarian unit may have a high impact value, meaning that they have a formidable first charge, but their value in an ensuing melee is less imposing.<br/><br/>The figure scales used for the game is 1:50 (one model figure representing 50 actual men) and the time scale is one turn equals approximately 60 minutes. The game attempts to allow entire ancient battles to be fought out in miniature on the tabletop.<br/><br/>At the time it was published, Milgamex' &quot;Ancient Warfare&quot; emerged as a potential rival to the popularity of WRG's &quot;Wargames Rules for Ancient and Medieval Battles.&quot; However, they could not push WRG's rules out of the place they had gained in international competition play. The rules went through two printings, but by 1980, they were difficult to find in stores.<br/><br/>",

They were called Autobots and Decepticons. But the brutal Decepticons were driven by a single goal: total domination. They set out to destroy the peace-loving Autobots, and a war between the forces of good and evil raged across Cybertron, devastating all in its path, draining the planet's once rich sources of energy. The Autobots, on the verge of extinction, battled valiantly to survive.&quot; - The Opening Narration from &quot;More Than Meets the Eye, Part I<br/><br/>When an elite team of Autobots left Cybertron in search of energon, they were pursued by Megatron and his Decepticons. They crashed on Earth four million years ago and fell into a state of involuntary hibernation. Then, in 1984 they awakened, making Earth into a battlefield, with energon as the prize. Now the heroic Optimus Prime and his valiant Autobots must stop Megatron and the cruel Decepticons from plundering the Earth and fueling a war of galactic conquest.<br/><br/>Transformers: Heavy Metal War is a card game that allows players to command their favorite Transformers from the first two seasons of the classic 1984 cartoon show. Each player must manage their hand and deploy Transformers with a variety of powers in order to complete missions, each giving the victor a unique reward. You will not only have the likes of Wheeljack, Jazz, Starscream, and Soundwave at your command, but also a host of lesser known Transformers, including Tracks and Reflector, as well as cards for human allies and unforeseen events.<br/><br/>So what are you waiting for? &quot;Transform and roll out!&quot;<br/><br/>",

The game focuses on tactical level combat and maneuver during Operation Battleaxe prior to the Crusader operation that lifted the seige of Tobruk. This is a stand alone game and does not need any other GSI title to be played.  It is slightly larger than Hafid Ridge in terms of the number of units and can be played in a relatively short time.The rules are modeled around the seven battlefield operating systems which make them easily understood and easy to learn.<br/><br/>This battle will provide a challenge to both players.  The British will find that they need to be very aggressive to push through the anti-tank defense.  The Germans have to simply hang on.  Either way it's a cliff hanger.  The British Matilda's are the queen of the battlefield, until they meet the 88's.  Obstacle play is important and significant.<br/><br/>Game play is excellent for solitaire play and moves along very quickly. The game is specifically designed to play in a day.<br/><br/>The Commonwealth forces were made up of 3 infantry battalions and a squadron and a half of Matilda tanks, heavy but undergunned and underpowered.<br/><br/>This game focuses on company / platoon combat and combined arms use. The time scale is either 1 or 2 hours per turn and each hex is 330 meters, depending on the game.<br/><br/>This game comes with:<br/><br/>    (2) 11x17 Color Map Sections<br/>    (1) Color Order of Battle Card<br/>    Approximately 200 Double-sided and Die Cut Counters<br/><br/><br/>(from box and publisher's website)<br/><br/>",

        "description": "The goals of this expansion are to flesh out some of the abstracted technologies within the original Origins (e.g. Obsidian, Iron, Roads) and to avoid the problems of a cycle of &ldquo;nothing to do&rdquo; turns that can happen in some games. The other consequence of this expansion is that geography plays a much larger role after Era I and well into Era IV (which seems to be keeping with the intended theme given Phil&rsquo;s Jared Diamond references). England is well placed to become a powerhouse in Era III and China can no longer be ignored. With a good foothold, the New World has great growth potential. Finally, before this expansion, in many games, Era II only lasted 2-3 turns despite representing over 30 ky and this expansion hopes to make Era II more interesting.<br/><br/>Important: This expansion assumes use of the Age of Reason Expansion (Era IV) and does not use the Animal Farm Expansion (playing from American Megafauna) but can likely be easily adapted and can use the alternate brain maps or be played after Bios Megafauna.<br/><br/>Features:<br/>- 25 Map Hex Overlays: Featured on the overlays are new resources to be<br/>exploited (including Coal, Jade and Trade Crops), a new south Pacific Route to<br/>the New World and the Toba Event.<br/>- 10 New Innovation and Population Actions: Including Interbreeding, Emissaries<br/>and Publication.<br/>- 9 Infrastructure Track Overlays: With new Infrastructure bonuses including<br/>Clipper Ships, Organic Farming and Paved Roads.<br/>- 2 Full Color Player Guides: Includes all the new Actions, along with a Terrain<br/>Guide, Selected Glossary and Slavery Rules. The Color makes it much easier to<br/>read (at least for me).<br/>- A Detailed Manual: Includes Wikipedia based footnotes in the style of the<br/>original manual.<br/>- Rules for porting the game over to High Frontier<br/><br/>",

The escorting force included the battleships HMS Duke of York and Anson, the cruisers USS Tuscaloosa and HMS Belfast, and 12 American and British destroyers including the USS Corry.<br/><br/>The task force reached launch position off the Vestfjorden before dawn on 4 October completely undetected.  At 06:18, USS Ranger launched 20 SBD Dauntless dive bombers and an escort of eight F4F Wildcat fighters. One division of dive bombers attacked the 8,000 long tons (8,100 t) freighter LaPlata, while the rest continued north to attack a German ship convoy. The bombers severely damaged a 10,000 long tons (10,000 t) tanker and a smaller troop transport. They also sank two of four small German merchant ships in the Bod&oslash; roadstead.<br/><br/>A second attack group from Ranger&mdash;consisting of 10 TBF Avenger torpedo bombers and six Wildcats&mdash;destroyed a German freighter and a small coastal ship, and bombed a troop-laden transport. Three of the aircraft were lost to anti-aircraft fire. On the afternoon of 4 October, Ranger was located by three Luftwaffe aircraft; her combat air patrol shot down two of the enemy planes and chased away the third.<br/><br/>",

Forces are created through a point-buy system, allowing players to customize the combat attributes, equipment, and special abilities of their troops.<br/><br/>A typical force is 3 to 20 miniatures, the game is played on a 3'x3' to 4'x4' tabletop, and can be completed in 30-60 minutes.<br/><br/>Three mission modes are included:  Raid, in which the attacking force must capture an objective protected by the defenders; Recon, in which each opposing force attempts to cause the other to suffer casualties and flee; and Retrieval, in which both forces seek to be the first to find and secure an objective.<br/><br/>",

All rules use D6 for resolving combat. Some of the rules, like the WW2 and Modern land, use rulers for movement and weapons ranges, while others use a grid system, like the WW2 and Modern aerial (hexes) the WW1(squares) and the WW2 naval (large areas). Representational scales vary from 1 base of miniatures = 1 Battalion or 1 Platoon, to 1 model = 1 aircraft or ship, again depending on the rules set.<br/><br/>Available as a free .pdf the Pz8 Wargaming Rules Collection includes:<br/><br/>- Pz8 WW2 rules <br/>- Pz8 1950-75 rules <br/>- Pz8 1975-2010 rules <br/>- Pz8 Sci-Fi rules <br/>- Pz8 WW2 Divisional rules <br/>- Pz8 1939-41 Naval rules<br/>- Pz8 WW2 Coastal rules<br/>- Pz8 Space rules<br/>- Pz8 WW1 Divisional rules<br/>- Pz8 1935-65 &amp; WW1 Aerial rules<br/>- Pz8 1965-75 Aerial rules<br/>- Pz8 Colonial Wargame rules<br/>- Pz8 Fantasy Wargame rules<br/>- Legio VIII Ancient / Medieval Wargame rules<br/><br/>",

She leads a crew of her most trusted kin on raids against human settlements, using her prowess with her pistolas to bring back loot. All of her kin are companioned to Ophelia, allowing them to activate together and get the first strike! She is also the only Henchman that Som'er may take, and she is key to his Crew.<br/><br/>However, Ophelia is more than just a trigger finger. She also has a host of abilities to enhance the gremlins around her, making her a fun and useful tool to any gremlin list, whether it is led by Som'er or herself.<br/><br/>Ophelia is an excellent leader to begin your Malifaux collection. She is versatile, intuitive, and just generally good and fun. Also, all of the models which you purchase for her are fantastic models for Som'er, and he is a good master to expand out to when you want a few more options.<br/><br/>The Ophelia Boxed set comes with all of the LaCroix kin except the Young LaCroix:<br/>Ophelia LaCroix<br/>Francois LaCroix<br/>Pere Ravage<br/>Rami LaCroix<br/>Raphael LaCroix<br/><br/>They are all unique models, so the boxed set provides one of each.<br/><br/>After you have that, you will probably want the Young LaCroix (she can take 3) followed by a blister of Slop Haulers and a blister of Bayou Gremlins when you are ready to expand, since they are the two best options for her, besides her kin.<br/><br/>",

        "description": "This game uses the Battle over Britain game system.  Included are set of 12 airplane counters for FH&amp;C, Dogfight Display, and Reference Card.  Planes included are Gloster Gladiator, Hawker Hurricane I, Vickers Wellington, MC-200 Saetta, SM-79 Sparviero, CR-42 Falco, Ju-87 Stuka, and Me-109E Emil, plus two Historical campaign games, and scenarios.<br/><br/>Each plane is dealt a hand of cards, the number of cards dependant on the plane's speed. Each turn represents just several seconds of real time. You play a card from your hand each turn to try and establish &quot;Advantage&quot; over the opponent... the side with Advantage may (depending on the values of the cards played) be able to fire a burst at the enemy. You will need to consider two main things each turn: your relative altitude (which is suit dependent), and relative fire position (which is card value dependent). When you find yourself &quot;disadvantaged&quot; (tailed), you can try to break off.<br/><br/>Plane ratings make a great deal of difference... for example, faster planes have larger hands, those with superior performance are tougher to tail and tougher to shake once they are tailing you, and an agile plane can &quot;yank the stick&quot; more effectively in a pinch. Firing a burst means you compare the relative fire position cards, roll one die, modify the roll by the plane's firepower modifier, and check the Fire Combat Table to see if you cause any damage (and/or critical hits) to the enemy. (And watch out for those rear firing gunners.)<br/><br/>If you find yourself damaged or out of ammunition, you can always try and disengage. When the deck of cards is exhausted, the game is over. You will quickly be able to &quot;read&quot; each plane's strengths and weaknesses from their ratings. Superior planes are stronger, of course, but anything can happen, and one false move might see you suddenly dodging bullets rather than dishing them out.<br/><br/>",

        "description": "\t\t\t\t<br/>\t\t\t\t<br/>\t\t\t\t\tIntroductionSligo is a territory game for two players: Black and White. It's played on the intersections (points) of an initially empty square board. Each player must have access to a sufficient number of stones of their own color.<br/><br/>This game is a mix of all the placement and movement rules of Corey Clark's Slither and the capture rule and winning condition of the ancient game of Go. Captures are performed after placements. Area scoring is used, and suicide is not allowed. The ko rule isn't needed.<br/><br/>\t\t\t\t<br/>\t\t\t\t<br/>\t\t\t\t\tDefinitionsA player's group is a set of one or more orthogonally contiguous stones of that player's color. A portion of a larger group is not a group.<br/><br/>A liberty of a group is an empty point orthogonally adjacent to that group. A group without liberties is said to be surrounded.<br/><br/>A player's territory is a set of orthogonally contiguous empty points such that all points orthogonally adjacent to it are occupied by stones of that player's color.<br/><br/>A weak pair is a set of two like-colored, diagonally adjacent stones such that there is no like-colored stone orthogonally adjacent to both.<br/><br/>\t\t\t\t<br/>\t\t\t\t<br/>\t\t\t\t\tPlayBlack plays first, then turns alternate. On your turn, you must either pass or place a stone of your color on an empty point. Before placing a stone, you may also move a stone of your color to an orthogonally or diagonally adjacent empty point.<br/><br/>After placing a stone, remove all surrounded enemy groups. In the resulting position, there must be no weak pairs and no surrounded groups of any color on the board.<br/><br/>Play stops when both players pass consecutively. At this point, the players may agree which groups, if any, can be removed from the board without changing the scores that would result from continuing the game. If there is such an agreement, the agreed groups are removed, the game ends and the resulting position is used for scoring. If the players don't agree which groups should be removed, play is resumed. In this case, when both players pass consecutively again, the game ends and the current position, without further removals, is used for scoring.<br/><br/>A player's score is the number of stones of their color on the board, plus the number of empty points in territories of their color, plus the value of komi (see below) in the case of White.<br/><br/>The player with the higher score wins the game.<br/><br/>\t\t\t\t<br/>\t\t\t\t<br/>\t\t\t\t\tKomiThe komi is the number of points which is added to White's score at the end of the game as a compensation for playing second. Before the game starts, the first player chooses the value of komi, and then the second player chooses sides.<br/><br/>",

        "description": "Rising Glory is the fourth game GMT Games is producing as part of their strategic friendship/partnership with Victory Point Games, and the 2nd from their Napoleonic 20 series (Fading Glory was the first). The idea for this and future volumes is that they will take multiple existing games from the VPG Napeoleonic 20 series, add an as-yet-unpublished game to the mix, and create a GMT boxed game with 3-4 games in the box, using larger (3/4&quot;) counters and mounted maps.<br/><br/>The Napoleonic 20 series from Victory Point Games are lower complexity wargames which use a common system originally created by veteran designer Joe Miranda, and further refined by developers Alan Emrich and Lance McMillan. The system&rsquo;s name is derived from the fact that there are generally just 20 or fewer pieces in play on the map at one time (that's 20 pieces total, for both sides). The system is easy to learn and fast-playing, creating a tense, dramatic and challenging situation on the game board where higher echelon troop formations (generally corps) vie for position and dominance. The series features twelve pages of Standard rules, four pages of Optional rules, and one-to-two pages of Exclusive rules for each title.<br/><br/>A hallmark feature of the Napoleonic 20 series is the use of narrative random event cards to help &ldquo;tell the story&rdquo; unique to each battle or small campaign. This &ldquo;friction of war&rdquo; element, combined with the operational-level maneuver, intense combat, and even periods of inactivity as armies pause to rest and reorganize, provides a thrilling battle full of unexpected twists and reversals of fortune. Morale plays a vital role as both sides can &lsquo;spend&rsquo; this precious resource to force march their units, help rally stragglers, or commit reserves to key combats. But look out&hellip; when a side&rsquo;s morale is reduced to zero, it has lost the game! The games also features simple optional rules for limited intelligence/Fog-of-War, the important shaping effects of leadership, and the gradual erosion of troop effectiveness due to fatigue.<br/><br/>The Rising Glory multi-pack features one game each from Alan Emrich and Lance McMillan, and two designs by Kim Meints.<br/><br/>Austerlitz 20(the &ldquo;Battle of the Three Emperors;&rdquo; Napoleon vs. Kutuzov, 1805)<br/>Jena 20, 2nd edition (Napoleon vs. the Brunswick &amp; Hohenloe, 1806)<br/> Eylau 20 (Napoleon vs. Bennigsen, 1807)<br/>Wagram 20 (Napoleon vs. Archduke Charles, 1809)<br/><br/>Game Components:<br/><br/>Four 17&rdquo; x 22&rdquo; mounted  maps ( 2 boards, backprinted)<br/>Approximately 150  3/4&quot;  Counters (thick, with Rounded corners, like No Retreat)<br/>48 Event cards (12 for each game)<br/>One 16-page Standard Rules booklet<br/>One 16-page Exclusive Rules playbook<br/>Two Player Aid charts<br/><br/>Individual Games designed by Alan Emrich, Lance McMillan, and Kim Meints<br/><br/>On February 9, 2015, GMT Games deleted this game from their P500 list and gave it back to Victory Point Games.<br/><br/>",

        "description": "Ski the Mountain is a competitive skiing game for up to six players in which the board is the piste map. The game recreates a real day on the piste with challenges, restaurant stops, and unexpected events.<br/><br/>Players begin at the bottom of the mountain with targets to achieve during the day. Each player plans his route, then sets off to ski as many runs as he can before the sun sets at the day's end.<br/><br/>Each turn players can collect piste cards to add to their hand, travel up ski lifts, or play piste cards to ski runs. Event cards can be played throughout the game to hinder your opponent or give you an advantage. Remember not to get stuck on the mountain when the sun sets!<br/><br/>Players score points for each run completed with additional points for some named runs. Each completed target scores additional points.  Whoever has the highest point tally at the end of the day wins.<br/><br/>",

        "description": "Game of Tones is a set of fourteen different music games designed to play with tonalities, chords, measures, key signatures, notes on the pentagram and even the location of the notes on a guitar neck. These multiple games can be played at different levels, depending on the musical knowledge of the players. The deck consists of 52 cards representing musical notes and rhythmic figures, with the help of the Circles of Fifths printed on each card, and with different suits or colors, together with some special wildcards.<br/><br/>It consists of many different games, featuring different game mechanics and goals: getting more points or cards than your opponents, be the first to run out of cards, move cards to certain places on the table, etc. In every game there are two different &ldquo;levels&rdquo; to keep track: the Musical Level and the Strategy Level, and both are independent from each other. The Strategy Level depends on the particular game, while the Musical Level can be adjusted in most of the games. Some of the games are up to 10 players, others are solitary type ones, for 2 players, and even some of the games can be played in teams or cooperatively.<br/><br/>Pawns are used in some of the games, and Game of Tones also includes two additional board games. These games are called Pianogram, in which the board represents a G-clef staff or a piano, depending on the orientation in which it is placed; and Fretboard, in which the board represents a guitar (or any other stringed instrument) neck.<br/><br/>Designed from an educational standpoint, Game of Tones includes a list of the musical concepts used in every game, and a teaching guide for music teachers. Game of Tones is not language dependent, except for the instructions, which are available in English and Spanish.<br/><br/>",

This project takes the Death Ride Kursk game system to a new level.  The maps for the entire 9 game series have been redone.  The design for the new maps was done by Rick Barber and the artwork by Kyle Gebhardt.  Game play is still characterized by the BOS, or Battlefield Operating Systems.  The rules have been restructured to include all of the rules for the enhancements.  They have also been reformatted to make it easier to understand and improve rules clarity.  Remember that even though the basic system is an I-Go-U-Go type system the order in which units move and actions occur is very open.  Players have a tremendous amount of flexibility to perform firing, movement, and obstacle removal, can be done when the player needs them to be done.  This means you get to control the synchronization of the battles activity to suit your plan.<br/><br/>While the rules are now quite large, they are very comprehensive.  Players will find great richness and depth in the level of detail.  There are now four different levels of game rules play.  From Basic to Ultimate.  For those wanting to play the basic game system you will still find great depth and detail.  For those wanting the ultimate experience you will find plenty of additional rules in the enhancements to make you feel like a real staff officer.<br/><br/>This game will be the base for the three SS games and the follow on games for Leibstandarte and Das Reich will be expansions.  Totenkopf will be needed to play the other 2 games.  Included in this game will be the counters for the Command and Control and Fire Support Enhancements.  These add some great details and rules right from when you make your purchase.  The Air, Maintenance, and Logistics Enhancement counters will be sold separately and are not yet ready for sale.<br/><br/>This game will come with:<br/>(16) 11x17 Full Color Map Sections<br/>(10) Unit and Marker Counter Sheets<br/>Death Ride Kursk Rules Booklet<br/>Totenkopf Rules Supplement<br/>(3) d10 Dice<br/>Numerous Charts and Tables<br/><br/>",

        "description": "WIXOSS (pronounced as We-Cross, from &quot;Wish Across&quot;) is a Japanese trading card game published by Takara Tomy. It is the game that the TV anime series Selector Infected WIXOSS is based on.<br/><br/>Two players each use a randomized Main deck (with black card backs) and a LRIG deck (with white card backs) that's always available in its entirety to defeat opponent's avatar called LRIG. It is done by destroying (or &quot;Crashing&quot;) all seven cards of their Life Cloth and then dealing the final strike. Players can attack either with their LRIG or summoned beings called SIGNI that come from the Main deck. <br/>Over the course of the game, players can &quot;Grow&quot; their LRIG with cards from the LRIG deck, getting access to more powerful SIGNI and various LRIG abilities. Both decks also have cards with one-shot effects: Arts (in the LRIG deck) and Spells (in the Main deck). These cards, as well as Growing a LRIG, require spending a certain amounts of Ener, which is represented by cards in your Ener Zone. You can put cards from both your hand and your side of the field into your Ener Zone once a turn. It is also the zone where defeated SIGNI and crashed Life Cloth cards go to. Some cards also produce additional effects called Life Bursts if they are crashed from the Life Cloth.<br/><br/>",

Corporations now run the planet.<br/><br/>After the Fast Food Wars of 2483, pizza corporations emerged as the dominant ruling entities of the planet.<br/><br/>In 2640, life was discovered in six previously unknown galaxies. Recent advances in space travel now make it possible to leap to and from these galaxies in minutes.<br/><br/>Now, Earth&rsquo;s pizza corporations are in a race to become the most well known pizza franchise in the universe.<br/><br/>Publisher's Description:<br/><br/>Winning the Game: In Solar Slice, each player assumes the role of a Pizza Corporation. At the end of the game, the corporation with the most points wins.<br/><br/>Game: A game consists of 4 rounds.<br/><br/>Round: Each round consists of 4 phases: Galaxy Prime, Marketing, Delivery, and Scoring.<br/><br/>During the Galaxy Prime Phase a launch card is revealed which establishes both the Galaxy Prime (the trump color), and the Scoring values of each galaxy for the round.<br/><br/>During the Marketing Phase players place a Marketing Ring onto the board in any galaxy they choose. This helps to protect their interests in that galaxy from sabotage.<br/><br/>During the Delivery Phase, players make a total of 10 Deliveries. A Delivery consists of each player playing 1 card from their hand The winner of each Delivery advances their pawn in a galaxy of their choosing.  Players win deliveries by either playing the highest numbered card of a starting color, or the highest Galaxy Prime card. Any sabotage cards played during the Delivery decrease  a chosen player's advancement in a particular galaxy.<br/><br/>During the Scoring Phase, players advance their pawns on the score track according to the values listed on the Launch Card associated with the round.<br/><br/>",

        "description": "In a wicked twist of inspiration, the Elemental Kings have decided to choose their champions by restricting all magic to a single source of spells in the form of an oracle.<br/><br/>This game requires the following components from TKG ARENA: The Elemental Kings &amp; TKG ARENA: Rise of the Magi.<br/><br/>FULL SPELL DECK:    1<br/>STANDARD DECK (DECK):    1 for each player.<br/>OINKS:    5 from each element for each player (Default)<br/>LIFE:    20 for each player (Default)<br/><br/>The objective of this game scenario is to achieve the highest number of KILLs in the rumble. A KILL refers to the elimination of another enemy player by reducing his/her LIFE to 0 during a player&rsquo;s turn. If a player is self-eliminated due to an unfulfilled deck out cost, this will not be considered a KILL. The eliminating player will get all remaining Oinks of the eliminated player. The game ends when it is evident that it is not possible to score more KILLs than any leading player who will become the winner. If all players are self-eliminated or there are players tied with equal number of KILLs, the last player to deck out will be the winner of the game.<br/><br/>Players start the game by each drawing a card from the top of a common shuffled DECK. The player with the highest number starts first and the players get their turns in a clockwise manner. The drawn cards go back to the bottom of the DECK. In the case of ties, the tied players draw again till the turns are resolved. Each player may attack each other according to the rules as described in TKG ARENA: Rise of the Magi.<br/><br/>The FULL SPELL DECK is shuffled and the top 5 cards are drawn and placed face up. During a player&rsquo;s turn, he/she may choose to expend 1 Oink in acquiring a special card of the same element among these 5 cards. The special card replaces its counterpart card (of the same ELEMENT and FACE VALUE) and the counterpart card is removed from play in the game. After replacement, the DECK is reshuffled. The acquired special card(s) goes to the bottom of his/her DECK and the player draws sufficiently from his/her DECK to recover his/her hand to 5 cards.<br/><br/>If a counterpart card is in a player&rsquo;s CURRENT HAND during his/her turn to acquire spells, the player may acquire it without cost. A player may make as many acquisitions as long as he/she has the necessary counterparts in his/her CURRENT HAND. If there are no counterparts cards in his/her CURRENT HAND, the player may still acquire the special card(s) by expending the appropriate cost as above. In addition, the player must end his/her turn immediately after the transaction. If the player does not acquire any special card(s) during his/her turn, he/she can choose to engage in battle with any other player in the group and the same rules of engagement (for the usual 2-player mode) apply including the use of the CHARGE BAR.<br/><br/>Every time a special card is acquired by a player, another is drawn from the FULL SPELL DECK pile to replace it. If a cycle of turns (from player back to the same player) passes with no players acquiring any special cards, all the available 5 special cards will be placed at the bottom of the FULL SPELL DECK pile and another 5 new ones are drawn.<br/><br/>Players may wish to use their own customised DECK in tournament mode for this scenario and omit the oracle (spell source) altogether. It is recommended that all players should then be fairly matched to warrant a fair game.<br/><br/>",

Each Assault Carrier is a potent instrument of conversion and compliance, capable of deploying thousands of troops and numerous fighter craft, backed by an array of devastating energy projectors that can burn entire continents to ash: a single CAS is sufficient to quell all but the most pernicious heresy, rebellion, or parasite outbreak. Colossally expensive to construct and few in number, the rare loss of an Assault Carrier is mourned by the entire Covenant.<br/><br/>Every major Covenant fleet has at least one Assault Carrier at its heart, if only because carriers themselves require a significant number of support vessels when operating away from High Charity or major outposts. Multiple carriers in a single fleet is unusual, but not unheard of. For example, the crusading Fleet of Sacred Consecration, commanded by the Prophet of Regret himself, is led by twin Assault Carriers, the Solemn Penance and Day of Jubilation. Together, these massive warships have scoured dozens of human worlds and bring righteous destruction to those within the Covenant who dare stand in the way of the Prophet&rsquo;s holy mission.<br/><br/>1 resin Assault Carrier<br/>    1 Medium/Small Sprue<br/>    1 custom Formation Base<br/>    1 Formation Sprue<br/>    4 Covenant Token Sheets<br/>    1 bag of 10 Halo Dice<br/>    2 Statistics Sheets<br/>    A5 Formation Overlay Sheets<br/><br/>",

        "description": "Meeple Maker is a 2-4 player light strategy game that plays in about 30-60 minutes.<br/><br/>Your goal is to get the most fans. To get fans interested, you'll produce games tailored to their demands. To meet those demands, you'll develop content with help from the internet.<br/><br/>Players take turns and either gain or spend content.<br/><br/>To gain content, they choose which website to move to from one of the next three clockwise websites (skipping over other players) and develop the content shown there (resources). Since each player's token never leaves the board and movement is limited, each move impacts the choices of others.<br/><br/>Players spend that content to grow their company, produce games, recruit people and get fans. All of these aspects are represented together on the cards in their hand or in the common market. These cards and their position determine the type and number of content that needs to be spent, as well as the skills (resource-gathering) and fans (score) the cards offer.<br/><br/>Those cards join their tableau, growing your company and helping players develop immersive worlds (theme), deep mechanics (strategy), valuable components, and wondrous artwork (the four types of content).<br/><br/>As players grow their companies to new sizes, they'll choose and flip tokens on the board. This changes how much resources are available and also acts as the game clock. When the last (eighth) token changes, the final round is played out. During final scoring, players gain resources based on who they recruited, and then spend them to acquire the cards in their hand. The end-game conditions are checked to see who has the most theme, strategy, component and artwork skills in their company and who gets the bonus points. The player with the highest score, i.e. most fans, wins.<br/><br/>The setup is highly variable, with resources being randomly placed on the board, different values for the end game conditions, and a constantly evolving, sliding market.  There are also several creators to choose from, an evolving board and many ways to manipulate the game - so each game is a new challenge to face.<br/><br/>",

        "description": "Description from the designer:<br/><br/>BaRPG is the unholy result of a one-night stand between a drinking game and  card based RPGs. From the side of RPG, BaRPG has inherited a melange of exciting characters to play, a definitely sexy level system, dice-rolling and booty (Err&hellip; I mean epic loot!). From drinking games, it has inherited a series of ridiculous games that will keep you drinking. Though in the end there will be a clear winner, we like to think the true prize is in the friends you will make along the way&hellip;<br/><br/>The game is played between 3 to 7 players. Each player receives a character card, and a level and damage tracking card. Every round all players (except whoever last levelled up) roll a dice, highest roll then checks if what was rolled is higher than their current level. If so, that player levels up, reads out their character's power (which is a drinking game), and the group then plays that game. At the end of the game, someone will have to take 'drinks' as well as take damage. The game then enters a market round, where players can 'buy' additional item cards. These item cards can be used at any time during the game, and can either assist players or thwart the efforts of others. The game then returns to a new round of dice rolling.<br/><br/>The first player to reach level 6 wins, and yes there is even an item that can be played against another player to put him/her back to level 1. There are in total 10 characters with associated games, and these characters will swap during the game as part of the item card mechanics. Additionally, losing a total of 4 'sober' (damage) points will also return the player to level 1, force them to change their character, and lose all accumulated items.<br/><br/>",

        "description": "The Thirty Years War was a series of conflicts that ravaged large areas of Europe, especially the German provinces, from 1618 to 1648. These conflicts centred on the Habsburg Holy Roman Emperors, Ferdinand II and Ferdinand III, and their opponents. Although viewed by many as a religious war between Catholic and Protestant nations, its roots and causes were also politically motivated. The combination of religious fervour and the political ambition of the European superpowers were to pit vast armies and mighty leaders against each other. The devastation caused by decades of fighting had truly turned Europe into the &lsquo;Devil&rsquo;s Playground&rsquo;.<br/><br/>This supplement for Pike &amp; Shotte describes the history, armies, personalities and battles of the Thirty Years War.

You can cooperate with the other players on specific actions, but this is definitely a competitive game at heart.<br/><br/>TrogloDice will have you recruiting new tribe members, developing weapons and shelters, and striking deals with neighboring clans to take down the biggest, baddest dinos in the land. At the end of the game the player with the most victory points is the winner!<br/><br/>",

The action here covers the initial German attack against the US 28th Infantry Division as the 26th Volksgrenadier Division attempt to clear the ground between the Our and Clerf Rivers in preparation for Panzer Lehr&rsquo;s advance on Bastogne.  What followed was three days of epic action which destroyed the German chances of victory.<br/><br/>Six battlefields provide a campaign which sees the Germans attacking and infiltrating to isolate the US defenders, initially with infantry but soon with armoured support while a gallant band of men fight on to the end.<br/><br/>This classic Pint Sized Campaign is designed to be run using the campaign rules in At the Sharp End and with Chain of Command rules.  Can you break through and open the route to the Meuse and Antwerp, or will you make an heroic stand and halt Hitler&rsquo;s lunatic vision of victory in the West?<br/><br/>Thirty-two pages long, this Pint Sized campaign provides the background history to the campaign with situation maps.  Uses period maps to show the location of the actions and then provides a complete campaign with forces for both sides, support options for players to select from and full victory conditions for all six battles and the campaign as a whole.<br/><br/>",

Coming to earth you develop an unhealthy fascination for the creatures we call cows. It is a race with your opponents to fill your ship with these animals. To win, you attack, defend and steal the cows of your opponents.<br/><br/>The card draw pile is composed of 4 categories of card: attack, steal, defend and utility. Attack cards kill cows; defend cards defend your cows; steal cards steal the cows of your opponents; and utility cards influence gameplay. You draw to a limit of 3 cards at the start of your turn. In addition, you take one cow token and one energy token from the main supply.<br/><br/>Each card has an energy cost associated with it, with more powerful cards costing more energy. Energy may also be acquired through utility cards, discarding a single card at the end of your turn or discarding 2 cards during. <br/>The winner is the player who acquires 10 cows, or the most cows once the card draw pile is depleted.<br/><br/>&mdash;description from the designer<br/><br/>",

Infiltration is not enough though, you must get your ninjas to the room where intelligence are gathered.<br/><br/>You do not know the internals of the castle at the beginning of the game but as the game progresses, the castle will slowly reveal itself.  This is accomplished by players playing cards to introduce hallways, ninjas and walls to each floor.  Players are trying to make the biggest room possible with the presence of their ninjas by capping a hallway with walls.  Only the single biggest room will count though:  Open ended hallways and rooms tied in size do not qualify.<br/><br/>The first player to successfully places 7 ninjas of his clan in the largest rooms in the castle wins!<br/><br/>",

        "description": "Nuclear Bro-liferation is a cooperative and competitive card game for 1-4 players. Players take the roles of Jon Johnson and his Special Operation Bros as they battle invading alien monsters. Along the way, players will face terrible social and political mishaps, friendly fire, and special boss monsters. Each game wave lasts 20-30 minutes, with up to four waves of increased difficulty. The competitive mode offers a cutthroat wave of resource grabbing, trophy hoarding, and backstabbing.<br/><br/>At the start of a players turn they will draw a card off the Battle Deck and either place the monster in the Battle Zone or resolve a political mishap. Next they can take one action to attack a monster, buy a item, heal, etc. After their action the player will draw one card from the Grunt Support deck to either aid or hinder the player on their turn. And finally, the monsters attack the player, causing 1 point of damage for every 4 strength. Then play moves to the next Bro.<br/><br/>The game continues until all monsters in the Battle Zone and Battle Deck are defeated. The players loose if all Bros die. If a Bro dies, you aren't out of the game yet! You can continue as a Bhrost and aid your team from the afterlife by drawing from the Battle Deck as normal and drawing 2 Grunt Support cards and choosing the better of the 2.<br/><br/>Competitive mode plays the same, however Bros will total up their kills at the end of the game, applying various modifiers.<br/><br/>The game can also be played solo! The player simply controls all 4 Bros at once, taking their turns one after another.<br/><br/>&mdash;description from the publisher<br/><br/>",

The last fragments of Devlin Stone&rsquo;s dream to shepherd humankind toward a more prosperous future hide behind the impenetrable defenses of Fortress Republic. As the interstellar communications blackout rages, the ambitious Great Houses vie for military dominance, and the bloodthirsty Clans strive to find a weakness in the Fortress&rsquo;s armor on their path to conquering Terra and claiming the coveted title of ilClan. When the Wall comes down, will the Inner Sphere plunge even further into the abyss of interstellar war, or will this herald the dawning of a new age?<br/><br/>Shattered Fortress chronicles the twilight of BattleTech&rsquo;s Dark Age, as nations are thrown into turmoil and predators circle the broken remnants of the Republic of the Sphere.

Compatible with with AvP board game and Unleashed wargame expansion.<br/><br/>Dutch Schaeffer is a no-nonsense Major in the USCM and an experimental &lsquo;half-synthetic&rsquo; cyborg developed by Weyland-Yutani Corporation after his arm was torn off in an off-world colonial resistance against a xenomorph hive. The only other known example of a cyborg in the USCM is Lieutenant Linn Kurosawa, who Dutch famously teamed up with after their supporting USCM squads were all but wiped out during a Xenomorph invasion of San Drad, California on Earth. Interestingly, Dutch and Linn also temporarily allied themselves with two yautja during that incursion, but that has since become highly classified and sensitive information, of which both Dutch and Linn have been programmed to forget about due to many suggestive rumours about Weyland-Yutani Corporation involvement. Schaeffer is a heavy-set Olympian of a man, enhanced by bionics throughout his body and carries an impossible to ignore cybernetic arm which he uses to smash his foes into the ground, grapple them, throw them or simply blast them to pieces with the M56 Smartgun mounted within it. Without the physique Schaeffer has maintained for himself, using this device would be practically impossible for any human to utilize.<br/><br/>Linn Kurosawa is a petite, cyborg soldier, but her size is no means indicative of her combat prowess. Where her counterpart Dutch is a wall of muscle and machine, Linn is a whirlwind of destruction armed with a pair of M7 heavy autopistols and a katana that has been honed to a mono-molecular edge, and able to cut through nearly any armour. Linn&rsquo;s armaments don&rsquo;t end there though, as she has an over-flowing arsenal of martial arts techniques which she applies in all kinds of combinations to deal a crushing, but utterly puzzling, blow to her<br/>adversaries. Since the xenomorph infestation incident of San Drad, Linn has continued to command the 13th USCM company and has seen far more off-world combat than Schaeffer, often in unexpected locations. To this day, Dutch and Linn team up in a variety of combat zones against all manner of foe.<br/><br/>&mdash;description from the publisher<br/><br/>",

Ogre teams, however, bring a new level of violence to the game, as their rosters feature not just one or two of these massive brutes, but often 4 of them! Of course, they're also accompanied by a veritable swarm of Gnoblars, tiny greenskin runts who have no natural athletic ability, but enough cunning and wit to know they're supposed to grab the ball from time to time whilst the Ogres are busy pummeling their opponents. Once in a while, the Ogres will give the ball-holders a little kick towards the End Zone, thus scoring some points with a bit of luck.<br/><br/>If you want to play some smashy Blood Bowl, you can do no better than an Ogre team. They play unlike anything else, excelling at deleting the opposing team, one by one, until they can walk the ball across the pitch unopposed. You&rsquo;ll focus on hiring a handful of Ogres, and the utterly replaceable gnoblars fill out the rest of your slots. Ogres are a blast to play, and a nightmare to go up against.<br/><br/>This multipart plastic kit contains all the components you'll need to build the Fire Mountain Gut Busters, an Ogre team for use in games of Blood Bowl, containing 4 Ogres (1 of which can be built as a Runt Punter), and 12 Gnoblars with interchangeable heads! You'll also find a roster sheet, transfers, 2 turn counters and 2 coins, 4 Ogre-themed balls, and a mix of 14x 25mm bases and 4x 32mm bases.<br/><br/>&mdash;description from the publisher<br/><br/>",

Its stories give players a lot of replayability and modular game map new experiences for each game. Become a leader of a Statera nation or a powerful God, fight for the territory, balance your believers, gather souls, and experience all of Statera's stories.<br/><br/>You can pick a different story for each game to determine the basic game's setup, get a richer experience, and learn more about the game world's story. By choosing to play for the nations of Statera or their gods you can also select the game's difficulty and the game's length.<br/><br/>In the Statera you will play as one of the nations of Statera or their God. The game is double-asymmetric. The first asymmetry comes from the difference between Gods and Staterans, second, there is an asymmetry between the factions. Some rules and patterns apply to the whole game, some only for Gods or Staterans, and some rules are specific to the faction.<br/><br/>The game is story-based. Each story tells a tale from the land of Statera and through that, it defines a number of players, unique victory conditions, setup, and some small rule adjustments. It basically means that each story, when played, feels like a different game.<br/><br/>The scale rising above the game board is a big part of Statera - the game and the world. The Stories already created for the game, are using the scale to count souls, balance them, lean towards a specific campsite, or take souls away from it. This component is simply crucial to play the game!<br/><br/>The important question is - Are you a brave Stateran, or a mighty god? It is time to lean the scale in your favor!<br/><br/>&mdash;description from the publisher<br/><br/>",

The game is best played with three to five players and is quite a brutal deception game. <br/>The Bad Samaritans are a bunch of outlaws, each of them recruited by The Chimp to join the team and battle each other in a twisted attempt to save the world.<br/><br/>The game consists of two dice and three decks of cards; characters, spells&amp;powers, and scenarios. The goal of the game is to defeat the scenarios which can be anything ranging from an alien invasion to helping a sexy lady with car trouble or just dealing with overflowing toilets&mdash;beating these, scores you victory points. If you gain enough victory points, you win!<br/><br/>But be careful, because the other Bad Samaritans won't let you win without a fight. With special powers and spells, they will do anything to thwart your victory. <br/>The cards perform unique actions which can create roulette like situations and death. Yes, in this game, you can actually die! Dying is a big part of the game. When someone dies, they start again with a new character, and they remove their powers&amp;spells.<br/><br/>The dice in the game get rolled for random occurrences and checks. Sometimes you'll need to throw a dice to survive.<br/><br/>&mdash;description from the designer<br/><br/>",

        "description": "Blood in Space is a micro but complete set of rules for solitaire or co-op skirmish game, set on a sci-fi background. &ldquo;Micro&rdquo; refers to the small set of rules, the small time required to complete one game session and the small number of miniatures required (4-10 figures being a common range). Many micro-details are left to the player, only the &ldquo;important&rdquo; rules are included in the eighteen pages of the game.<br/><br/>The game includes seventeen Scenarios covering iconic sci-fi scenes like exploring the planet surface, attacking an enemy base, searching an abandoned starship, freeing prisoners. Event markers placed on the Map will create the needed Fog of War and randomize the placement of enemies, events and of course loot! Terrain rules allow to quickly create different planetary conditions.<br/><br/>Scenarios can be played individually or as part of a Campaign game: in this case a flowchart will (randomly) determine the next mission; as an example, after a &ldquo;Exploration&rdquo; mission a bad roll could send your characters on the &ldquo;Ambush&rdquo; scenario. Characters on a Campaign will be able to improve their characteristics, but with the improvement of the Reputation Level of your Crew, your enemies will also become stronger.<br/><br/>Activation of units (friendly and enemies) is managed with a pool of activation markers, but you can never be sure that every unit will be activated. When an &ldquo;Enemy&rdquo; marker is drawn by the pool you will roll on the ENEMY ACTIVATION table in the current Scenario to determine the unit to activate and its orders.<br/><br/> What's new in the second edition <br/><br/>Completely redesigned starship missions, now including<br/><br/>     21 Starship Cards<br/>     24+ Starship Tiles (300dpi)<br/>     Starship Events Table (two pages, 36 events)<br/>     New Enemies (Demons, Mutants, Insane Crews, Void Spiders)<br/>     PSI Rules: PSI powers for the characters (and for the Enemies as well)<br/>     Exoskeletons (civilian and military)<br/>     Bionics: enhance your characters with implants.<br/>     Madness rules<br/>     New Missions<br/>     New Weapons and Equipment<br/><br/><br/>Additional free components for the game are available on the Studium CMLXV site.<br/><br/>Blood in Space is fully compatible with the fantasy rules for Blood on the Blade<br/><br/>",

The active player will roll the die twice and resolve a spawning of specters across the rooms. When the specter's phase ends, the active player's turn ends.
