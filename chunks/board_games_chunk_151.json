Watch out for action cards that speed up or slow down progress. Be first to gather six gemz cards of the same color to win.<br/><br/>Setup involves dealing three gemz cards to each player, face up. If an action card is dealt at this time it is placed back in the deck and dealing continues until each player has three cards.<br/><br/>To start play, everyone lays the three cards they were dealt side by side in a semi-circle. The youngest player goes first by drawing one card from the top of the draw pile. If it's a gemz card they add it to their circle. If it's an action card they follow the instructions. Turn-based play continues to the left and players lay down every gemz card they draw until their circle is full. Players may only have six cards total at a time; once their circle is full, they must choose to discard their newly drawn cards or swap them with an existing piece of their circle.<br/><br/>The game continues until one player has gathered 6 gemz cards of the same color. Luck-of-the-draw and the game-changing SWAP cards make sure that no player can coast to an easy win. The rules are simple enough for younger children, teens, and adults to all enjoy playing together.<br/><br/>Includes: 63 triangle-shaped game cards: 11 each of green, orange, red &amp; blue Gemz Cards; 4 Wild Multicolor Gemz; 15 Action Cards (7 Swap, 4 Lose a Turn, and 4 Lose a Card).

Historical specifications have been taken into account as far as possible. In other places, history should and must be rewritten. It is based on 1862, set in the same region and with the same companies which was released in 2000.<br/><br/>Players invest in railway companies. They create a rail network with track tiles on the game board and drive these routes with their trains and generate income. The player with the most shares in a railway company is its director. He decides whether this income will be distributed to shareholders as a dividend or whether it will be added to the company's treasury for future investments. With 7 train types from 2 to 8, the progress over time and the technical development is shown.<br/><br/>As with many games in this series, there are similarities within the rules, but many have subtle differences that give each and every 18xx game its character.<br/><br/>1862: USA&amp;Canada has an interesting set of differences described above.<br/><br/>These include: The companies gradually come into play in 3 groups. She can buy back shares, even from players, which is good for the company but bad for your share limit.<br/><br/>Bonus rides and tokens are integrated into the game in a new way. Trains can be bought either as &quot;normal&quot; trains or as E-trains and many other little things!<br/><br/>When developing 1862: USA&amp;Canada, attention was paid to a reduce the playing time.

        "description": "Two rival business magnates are competing to take control of a high-rise office tower. <br/>Each owner operates a business on their side of the building.<br/><br/>Before leaving for the day, each of the owner&rsquo;s employees pulls the shades on their windows to reveal random letters.<br/><br/>When the owners arrive back to work in the morning, they check to see what words have been made across the windows on their side.<br/>The owner whose side of the tower has the best scoring words, wins that day.<br/><br/>After several days, the owner with the top score will control the building.<br/><br/>Word Magnates is a strategic word game for two players, aged 7+. It is a game of building a tower of two-sided magnetized letters without your opponent knowing what words they are making. It&rsquo;s a game of secret word creation.<br/><br/>COMPONENTS:<br/> - Lasercut tower with &quot;windows&quot; to view the letters.<br/> - Built-in score board.<br/> - 30 wooden black magnetic tiles.<br/> - 30 wooden white magnetic tiles.<br/><br/>Each set of 30 magnetic tiles is coloured black on white or white on black and have point values (1-5).<br/><br/>SETUP:<br/>1. Insert the tower into base. <br/>2. Spread all the tiles face up.<br/>3. Uncouple any tiles stuck together.<br/>4. Group the tiles by colour into black and white sets.<br/>5. Each player takes 10 black vowels (two each of A, E, I, O, U) and 10 white vowels.<br/>6. Flip and shuffle the remaining tiles upside down within each group. Important: Do not mix the colours!<br/>7. Each player takes half of the tiles from each group, placing them secretive in their own area.<br/>8. Decide who will play which colour.<br/>9. Grab paper and pencils for scoring.<br/><br/>GAME PLAY:<br/>Either player starts by attaching one tile of each colour together and dropping both combined tiles into one of the three tower slots. Take turns attaching and dropping tiles. Make sure you always drop your coloured tile in front of you with the opposite tile as the other colour. Each player can only see their side of the tower. Try to drop letters such that their placement will help you make words and thwart your opponent.<br/><br/>FORMING WORDS:<br/>As letters are dropped, words of three or more letters will eventually be formed in any of eight directions. These can be top to bottom, bottom to top, diagonal, across or backwards.<br/><br/>Keep dropping letters until the tower is full with 24 tiles (12 drops per player).<br/><br/>SCORING:<br/>After completely filling the tower, scoring takes place. Players write down their words formed and tally the letter values. Players validate each other's words. Each player maintains their score on their built-in scoring track.<br/><br/>After scoring, turn the tower upside down to dump out the letters. Separate each set of tiles and detach the magnetic tiles.<br/><br/>BONUS POINTS:<br/>Any player finding one word that their opponent missed will collect those points!<br/><br/>WINNING:<br/>After several rounds, the first player to exceed 200 points (or a predetermined target) will be the winner. In case of a tie, the highest word made in the current round breaks the tie.<br/><br/>-description from designer<br/><br/>",

When the French finally withdrew before advancing Spanish and allied forces, the French commander ordered the destruction of the Alhambra with explosives. But one Spanish soldier, Jos&eacute; Garc&iacute;a, despite having injury and wounds from a previous battle, raced through the 26-acre complex, disarming bombs and saving this amazing piece of history.<br/><br/>Jos&eacute; Garc&iacute;a Saves the Alhambra is a solitaire game commemorating this story. All you need is a regular deck of cards and one six-sided die to play. Download the game for free from the itch.io webpage.<br/><br/>&mdash;description from the publisher<br/><br/>",

Unfortunately, bricks are in short supply at the Brickyard and your competitor is trying to satisfy their customers&rsquo; orders as well. It is a frantic race of getting the most bricks in the short amount of time.<br/><br/>You will have four orders to fulfill for the game. With each turn you are moving your dump trucks around the board to different dig sites. Once there, you will load as many bricks tokens as your dump truck can hold. The first player to fulfill all four orders wins the game. Plan your day well, for your opponent is certainly planning theirs.<br/><br/>Game Overview: Players will have 12 action points (AP) to use for their turn. Players then take turns moving their dump trucks around the board to get to certain dig sites. Here they will load up bricks that  their customers want. Players will take their loads to the unloading zone and place them on their order sheets. Once unloaded, their trucks will go back into the Brickyard to get more bricks.<br/><br/>-description from designer<br/><br/>",

Now there are cities on the Moon and Mars, and mining communities in the asteroid belt. But our Solar System is just the beginning. It might be home, but Earth is the only truly hospitable planet nearby. However, recent breakthroughs in warp travel mean that interstellar voyages are finally a reality.<br/><br/>There are several extrasolar systems that have been discovered to have planets and moons which appear to be very Earthlike, and likely hospitable. The nearest of these is in the Gamma Leporis tri-star system, 29 light years away from Earth. A series of moons orbiting a gas giant named Yutu show breathable atmospheres, tolerable radiation levels, reasonable temperatures, liquid water, and plenty of land. Now, the race is on. Terran, Lunar, Martian, and Belter organizations are competing to be the first to send humans to one of these habitable moons and establish a permanent human colony. It will take research, determination, and a bit of luck to be the first to arrive. Do you have what it takes to drive the next great space triumph and win the Race to the Moons?<br/><br/>Overview:<br/>Race to the Moons is a worker placement game where 2-5 players (solo variant included) are working to research the technology needed to complete an interstellar mission and be the first to found a human colony on a moon system around a gas planet in another solar system. Players must research technologies that affect different parts of the mission: Journey, Arrival &amp; Landing, and Colonization, as well as Training their crew. Players must also work on building rockets, building facilities (research labs, factories, launch stations, and more), managing money, and improving public opinion. Players race to have their rockets arrive at the destination and set up a successful colony to earn enough points to beat the competition.<br/><br/>&mdash;description from the designer<br/><br/>",

An era which now has ended as the last atomic bombs ever produced have been used in war. Only a small fraction of the world's population has survived, consisting mainly of various military groups whose days are numbered as radiation poisoning from nuclear fallout, as well as the uncontrolled spread of biological weapons, is quickly claiming the lives of the last survivors.<br/><br/>As a leader of a remaining military faction, you have devised a plan to take the survival of humanity into your own hands. You have set up a base in the northernmost regions of Scandinavia,  an area which has been spared from the worst bombings. Before the war, the world's most advanced space faring operations were being conducted here and you have managed to secure a disassembled but otherwise functional lunar rocket left behind from those times. On the Moon's surface, a self-sustainable base was once constructed as part of the Swedish space program, but it has not been inhabited for many years now. If you could get a crew there, that base could serve as a new home for the last humans. And maybe in a distant future when Earth is habitable once more, a return trip could be possible. However, it seems as though your enemies have had the same plan. A race to secure the fusion batteries and rocket components needed to initiate the launch sequence is ensuing, in what will be the last battle on earth.<br/><br/>In order to win, you must balance your time between exploring new territories, investing in resource production, advancing the tech-tree, conducting research, mobilizing troops and attacking your opponents.<br/><br/>&mdash;description from the designer<br/><br/>",

        "description": "The rules originated from a desire to wargame the encounters between submarines and ASW forces portrayed in books such as Red Storm Rising (Tom Clancy and Larry Bond), and in films such as &lsquo;The Hunt for Red October&rsquo; and &lsquo;Crimson Tide&rsquo;.  I also was keen to use the 1/700 scale submarine and ship kits I was building as they are such great kits and I couldn&rsquo;t find any rules!  Modern naval wargaming has often suffered from being seen as too complex to wargame on the table top because of the technological complexity and therefore now is thought perhaps best suited to computer simulation.  Existing table top rulesets such as &lsquo;Harpoon&rsquo;, &lsquo;Prosub&rsquo; or &lsquo;Modern Naval Battles&rsquo; either require detailed calculations and although very accurate, are often not suited to an evening club game or are designed as an abstract card based system that doesn&rsquo;t allow miniatures to be used.  <br/>The difficulties arise because these sets are comprehensive and encompass all facets of modern naval combat with the submarine aspect a minor player.  There are in reality several distinct aspects to modern naval warfare.  At one extreme, carrier or land based airstrikes or missile strikes can originate several hundred miles away and yet be resolved in seconds, whilst at the other end the stealth and uncertainty of submarine combat can take daring, guile and be enacted over short distances where collisions are a real danger.<br/><br/>By concentrating on submarines and ASW specifically I have tried to develop a playable (I hope), fun and yet challenging set of rules that capture the specific tactics and tension of the &lsquo;aerial dance&rsquo; beneath the waves, with variable levels of complexity that can be added as desired.  The core rules are unashamedly simple to try and give a playable game on a club night and I have resisted the temptation to add extra complexity.  Further rules will follow in subsequent updates.<br/><br/>",

        "description": "The game is played on an ordinary checkerboard. Each of the two players has 12 double-colored pieces or men(one black and white, the other green and red). The players place their men on the black squares of the 3 rows closest to them, so that the dark side (black or green) comes up.<br/>Players take turns advancing their men on the black quares, only one square at a time. You are forced to jump over an opponent's man as soon as your own man touches that of your opponent and there is a free space behind him. Here, the opponent's man that has jumped over is taken along and placed at the bottom on the free space behind it. The jump must be continued if there is another opportunity. With each jump, only one enemy man can be taken as a prisoner. The man captured last is always at the bottom of the board. This is how towers are built. A tower moves or jumps like an ordinary man. If a tower is jumped over, only the top man may be taken and captured. If a man reaches one of the last 4 squares of the checkerboard, it is turned over so that the light side (white or red) comes up. He becomes a king. If a tower arrives on one of the last squares, only its top piece may be turned over. Such a tower moves or jumps like a king. A king may move forward or backward one or more squares or capture.<br/>The game is decided when all of a player's men or kings are captured or when they can no longer be moved. The number of kings of both players gives the number of points with which the game was won.<br/><br/>&mdash;user summary<br/><br/>",

Everything you need to play the game is included in the one book, including cut out assets, ship standies, game boards and an 8 scenario campaign.<br/><br/>It's 2930 and humanity has found a new home planet, thrown from Earth by a sentient machine system some years ago. However, it wasn&rsquo;t the only species to flee into space &ndash; lycans were the first to run, finding refuge on a distant planet. Now, after centuries of silence, the lycans are resurgent. The machine intelligence on Earth has also been developing advanced weaponry to derail humanity&rsquo;s hopes of a new beginning.<br/><br/>Are you going to be humanity&rsquo;s hope or downfall?<br/><br/>Supremacy: Arms Race is a diceless system that runs on 'Action Points.' The faction and commander you choose will determine the amount of AP you will receive each turn and it's up to you how you spread those points across your fleet, either offensively or defensively? But, be careful as attacks also cost AP. So, do you hang back and upgrade your ships or unload a barrage of artillery at your opponent? Do you split your AP and do a bit of both or outmanoeuvre the enemy and board them, ripping their ships apart and removing their upgrades? In the end it's a game of strategy and war!<br/><br/>&mdash;description from the publisher<br/><br/>",

This pocket-sized adventure will have you and up to three friends or enemies battling ancient Kings for magical weapons, facing down hordes of undead souls and beasts, haggling with the Hag o' the Winter for your very life, using the Labyrinth's everchanging passageways for your advantage, whispering mystic incantations in old Gaelic, standing on the edge of the Eternal Chasm on the brink of being subsumed by Evil itself... and all in your lunch break! If you love the moody storytelling aspect of classic fantasy RPGs, and easy rules that make for fast-flowing action thick with atmosphere, you will adore this game. Best played on an old wooden table under candlelight with a tankard of Scottish ale or honeymead.<br/><br/>For solo gamers, it is most fun to play Labyrinthians with two of the provided characters, who you can use to come to your aid in times of high peril, attain the characters' personal quests, or vie against in moments of merciless betrayal or greed.<br/><br/>For those who want a longer game or want to enjoy Labyrinthians as a multi-session campaign, there are expansions to the core game too. The Labyrinth has three new levels: the sewers, the earthen and the magma levels. And there is a three-part prequel wilderness campaign: The Woodland Way, the Bogs of Moorh, the snowy path to The Secret Tree, where lies the entrance to the Labyrinth itself.<br/><br/>&mdash;description from the designer<br/><br/>",

        "description": "Taira Ships, Minamoto Horses: Genpei Naval Records is a board wargame based on naval battles from February 1184 to April 1185 during the Genpei War.<br/><br/>In general, the Minamoto clan and the Taira clan are the focus of attention in the Genpei War, but in this game, the Seto Inland Sea's &quot;Hometown Navy&quot; is the main character.<br/><br/>Both the Taira clan and the Minamoto clan must continue to fight in order to gain their allies, who are sensitive to the consequences of the war.<br/><br/>In naval battles at that time, when neither nautical charts nor systematic information was maintained, it was important to have a deeper knowledge of the &quot;local sea&quot;.<br/><br/>In this game as well, you can experience how having a local navy on your side who knows the local sea will greatly affect the outcome of a war.<br/><br/>",

It assembled six army groups and several supporting troops to form two fronts, the Southwest Front and the South Front, and planned to regain the strategically important Kharkov. The Second Battle of Kharkov broke out.<br/><br/>However, in just 20 days, the Soviet army, which had lost the winter bonus, suffered a disastrous defeat in the Second Battle of Kharkov due to command errors and underestimated the strength of the German army, losing nearly 260,000 people.<br/><br/>The defeat was so crushing that the Soviets tried to hide it or avoid talking about it long after the battle ended.<br/><br/>&quot;Schlacht bei Charkow&quot; is an independent work dedicated by Kuro Neko Design Workshop. After at least 3 years of various physical tests, it tries to restore the most exciting Second Battle of Kharkov.<br/><br/>In the game, one side player will play the role of Bock, the commander of the German Army Group South, and the other side player will play the role of the Soviet Southwest Strategic Trio (Commander Timoshenko, Political Commissar Khrushchev, and Chief of Staff Bagramyan).<br/><br/>&mdash;description from the publisher (translated)<br/><br/>",

        "description": "This latest Game Deck adds a new layer of challenge&mdash;and opportunity!&mdash; to your table top actions with either of these classic rules sets.<br/><br/>Instead of one rule to describe the effects of all terrain on movement, cover, and visibility, now with the flip of a card even more excitement and suspense enters the game.<br/><br/>Since when in foreign lands, often tropical, is every stretch of jungle, or hill side, desert, swamp, track, etc, identical in difficulty to cross, or see into, or through, or provide the same cover from fire? And why does every creek, stream, or even river have the same conveniently firm bottom that makes crossing speed predictable?<br/><br/>The Variable Terrain Effects Deck now gives players the hope that a given area of terrain might be easier to march through&mdash;but also the risk that it&rsquo;s tougher than it looks!<br/><br/>More than ever, the use of Scouts to recon the ground ahead takes on new importance--not merely to spot the enemy, but to make sure of the ground you might meet him on.<br/><br/>And life for the Games Masters who host tabletop games definitely gets easier. Now they can layout such trees, hills, and other miniature terrain features as they have without having to suggest just how &ldquo;thick&rdquo; the forest is, or any other hints suggesting the degree of difficulty.<br/><br/>When first entering a terrain feature, the British/Imperial Player will draw an appropriate terrain card type--forest/jungle, one of three types of water hazards, swamps, sand/beach, rough ground, or track&mdash;and read its effects, from a walk in the park to practically impassable. A simple printed marker (provided for all types) with the number of the card drawn and the terrain type is placed at the entry point for future reference, and it&rsquo;s as easy as that!<br/><br/>There are 48 individual Terrain Effects Cards, six each of the 8 types, plus 14 cards on which are printed 6 numbered markers with the names of the terrain types on the opposite sides, plus 1 card with instructions for use. The markers are cut out for use in play and may be stored in the same plastic re-closable bag the deck arrives in.<br/><br/>&mdash;description from the publisher's website<br/><br/>",

        "description": "At the end of the Eastern Han Dynasty, foreign relatives ruled over power, eunuchs ruled the country, and the Han court was at sunset, and the glory of the past was no longer there. First there was chaos caused by the Yellow Turbans, and then there was the dictatorship of Dong Zhuo, and the world has not had a single day of peace. The times make heroes, and many heroes and heroes emerged at this time, and they gathered in the Central Plains one after another, ushering in the war-torn era at the end of the Han Dynasty.<br/><br/>In 190 A.D., the princes from all walks of life formed a coalition to attack Dong Zhuo, and Dong Zhuo was forced to retreat and move westward to Chang'an. In 191 A.D., the coalition forces were disbanded due to discord, and the princes had ulterior motives in their hearts, and they did not hesitate to fight each other in order to compete for territory. The following year, Dong Zhuo was killed and L&uuml; Bu fled. Beginning in 191 A.D., the seven forces in the Central Plains have gradually developed into powerful heroes through conquests and mergers. Lu Bu, the flying general who is unparalleled in the country, Yuan Shu who proclaimed himself emperor in Huainan, Liu Bei who took over Xuzhou, and Liu Biao who sat on the sidelines. Father and son of Sun Jian and Sun Ce, Cao Cao, the hero of troubled times who fought a decisive battle in Guandu in 200 AD, and Yuan Shao, the overlord of Hebei......<br/><br/>Warlords in the Last Years of Han Dynasty can accommodate 2-7 players to play the game at the same time. It is divided into 8 historical scenarios, 2 instructional scenarios and 1 hypothetical scenario. Because the Romance of the Three Kingdoms, one of the four great classics, has a huge influence on later generations, the game design is based on official history and supplemented by romance, so as to avoid players being difficult to adapt for a while. In the &quot;advanced rules&quot;, more realistic optional rules are provided, which will simulate the history of the end of the Eastern Han Dynasty to a greater extent.<br/><br/>&mdash;description from the publisher (translated)<br/><br/>",

Including the usual Command Bonus cards, the 800FE Boxer Rebellion Action Deck totals 56 Cards, 8 more than in the other 800FE Decks.<br/><br/>The Chinese are represented by 12 cards cuing Boxer units to Move/Fire, plus cards for units of the four Chinese Armies engaged between Peking and Tientsin. There are five cards each for units of General Nieh's &quot;Tenacious Army,&quot; General Sung-Ching's &quot;Resolute Army,&quot; General Tung-Fu-Hsiang's &quot;Kansu Braves,&quot; and General in Chief Yung-Lo's Manchu Bannermen.<br/><br/>For the eight combatant Allies, the Action Cards are provided in the same proportions as each nationality comprised the total forces engaged (prior to the arrival of the German East Asia Brigade). Consequently, there is one card each for the Italians, Austrians, French, and Germans, two each for the British, American, and Russians, and five for the Japanese.<br/><br/>If any of these contingents are not represented on your table top, the otherwise unnecessary cards may be used to cue Movement/Fire of other, more numerous units in your collection. Similarly, European and Chinese Army units not present may have their cards removed from the Deck prior to play.<br/><br/>By this arrangement, the Players on both sides will not only have to deal with the usual uncertainty of order of Movement and Fire of their own and the enemy's units, but must allow for each &quot;faction&quot; of his forces having their own say when they feel like, rather than as the C-in-C might-- exactly as in the real conflict.<br/><br/>&mdash;description from the publisher<br/><br/>",

Designed for 2 or 4 players (1v1 or 2v2), Feud allows players to take on the role of a king who must gather resources, build structures, train armies, and engage in battles with other kingdoms to expand their empire and defeat their enemies.<br/><br/>Gameplay in Feud is a mix of resource management, city-building, and military strategy. Players must collect resources like food, wood, and gold to build structures, train units, and research technologies.<br/><br/>As the game progresses, players must make strategic decisions about which technologies to research and when to attack their enemies. Each player&rsquo;s ultimate goal is to be the last king standing and control the most territory. The game is won by the player who has conquered the most territory and eliminated all of their opponents.<br/><br/>Another feature of Feud is that it incorporates an element of bluff. Each player&rsquo;s stronghold is kept secret until it is scouted by their opponents. This means that players can create elaborate feints and ruses to deceive their opponents into thinking they have a strong or weak position.<br/><br/>",

Each turn, players will move their mad-scientist on the 3x3 board to a new location where they will capture (i.e., draft) 1 die if there are at least 2 present. Based on the die taken, a die from an adjacent location is removed, re-rolled, and placed into the reserve pool. If there are dice in the reserve, the player then place 1 die on any location with an opening for that faction (i.e., color).<br/><br/>Game play continues until each location has 1 die only (9 dice on the board). The player with the highest total influence (sum of dice) in each faction wins control of that faction. Controlling a faction at game end grants a player victory points equal to the sum of the faction dice left on the main board. That is, only the 9 dice left on the board score points for any player.<br/><br/>Players must carefully draft the right dice to gain control of the faction while also ensuring that any faction they control has high scoring dice on the board at the end of the game.<br/><br/>-description from publisher<br/><br/><br/>Truly, it was a GREAT Idea!<br/><br/>World domination was waiting; all you needed was a few extra hands.

Each turn players choose an ACE card from a hand of 3 and then select 1 of 3 possible actions:<br/><br/>A: Authorized Action - to place or move workers within the organization. <br/>C: Claim Credit - to score points with the board on your journey to CEO. <br/>E: Executive Event - Seize opportunities created by well meaning, but ill-advised executives.<br/><br/>Positioning Cubers into key organizational positions grants a player access to department bonuses. Some departments protect your Cubers from actions and events, some augment Claiming Credit, and others alter a player's hand. Leveraging these department actions is key to getting ahead of your competition!<br/><br/>Play continues until one player gains access to the CEO's office (25+ Promotion Points). All players take an even number of turns and the player with the most promotion points is appointed the new CEO and wins the game.<br/><br/>This is not a business simulation!

The game starts with players taking a hidden role and proceeds over 8 rounds.<br/><br/>Each round begins with 3 draft passes where cards are exchanged between all of the players. After the drafts, play consists of tricks where players attempt to capture cards aligned to their secret role while avoiding collecting cards aligned to their role's nemesis. To help keep roles secret, scores in all four suits are kept for each player until the end of the game.<br/><br/>At the end of the game, players score points only for their role cards and lose points for any their nemesis cards obtained.  Cards acquired from the other two suits do not gain or lose the player any points. The player with the highest total score wins.<br/><br/>The Franciscan Diamond requires players to play differently based on their assigned role. It is important to try to uncover the roles of others so that the drafts can ensure the right cards end up with the right players to create tricks that are favorable to a player's goals. This manipulation must then be balanced against keeping your secret role hidden.

        "description": "In the 14th solar month of the year 2235, the merchant ship Antares encountered an unknown alien entity.<br/><br/>During their return trip home, the crew diverted from their heading to investigate an archaeological find on a distant moon, orbiting a small binary system, outside the Alpha Centauri cluster. The site was found to contain artifacts from an ancient race that had long vanished from that system. Among the ruins the crew uncovered an alien chrysalis. Believing it to be one of the artifacts it was unknowingly taken on board.<br/><br/>Six days after their departure from the moon the alien was released from the chrysalis, and it was free and roaming the ship. The crew made preparations to abandon ship, believing that the alien was hostile. They were correct in their assumption.<br/><br/>Using the collected audio and video surveillance data from on board the ship the events that followed have been pieced together.<br/><br/>This is the record of the events that occurred on the Antares while the crew tried desperately to abandon ship.<br/><br/>Play out the crew's final hour as they attempt to abandon ship. Antares is geared for easy solitaire play, but can be expanded to up to 7 players.<br/><br/>Antares is a thematic, space horror game. The actions of the crew are up to you, and the choices you make may well determine who survives, and escapes the doomed vessel Antares, and who falls victim to the alien lifeform.<br/><br/>Antares is the first game in the Antares series. Telling the first chapter of the story of the doomed ship Antares, and its alien cargo.<br/><br/>Antares is playable solo or co-op.<br/><br/>Game play<br/><br/>Build the Antares using the Cabin and Corridor tiles. The ship must have all corridor ends connected to Cabins. Different builds of the Antares offer different levels of difficulty.<br/><br/>Choose your crew selecting one side from each of the seven crewmember cards. Each crewmember has their own unique ability and choice of two starting locations.<br/><br/>Complete the Navigation, Reactor, &amp; Mainframe Access objectives. Spending an action in the Bridge, Reactor Room, or Mainframe Access cabins will advance the matching counter 1 spot forward. Use of the Air Ducts can expedite movement through the ship, but the alien lifeform has found them to be useful as well.<br/><br/>Collect enough O2 Canisters and Spacesuits for any surviving crewmembers before they head to the Escape Craft. Flame throwers may be found in the Cargo Hold, and can be used to ward off an alien attack. Each encounter with the alien lifeform can cause the crew to experience Fear, Terror, or Paranoia.<br/><br/>Avoid the alien lifeform. As the crew complete objectives and collect precious items they are constantly at risk of attack from the alien. After each action performed a Scan card must be drawn which will indicate if the alien attacks, or if the crew is safe for one more round.<br/><br/>Escape if the crew manages to complete all objects they may regroup in the Escape Pod, and execute the Delta Launch Code to escape the doomed Antares merchant vessel.<br/><br/>&mdash;description from the designer<br/><br/>",

The AI created our clues using aspects of the movie&rsquo;s plot and characters, but it's not obvious what the AI &ldquo;knows&rdquo; about these movies, so we&rsquo;re never sure about what it&rsquo;s going to spit out. Some clues go off script and bits of the real world creep in, with the names of actors, directors, or aspects of the movie&rsquo;s critical reception. And sometimes the computer tells us things that come out of nowhere, like an incorrect movie quote or a #badhashtag.

IMPACT using miniatures, either with or without the map sheets.<br/><br/>Components include:<br/><br/><br/>     Rules Manual<br/>     Geomorphic Map Sheets (10)<br/>     Scenario Cards (12)<br/>     Player Aid Cards (3)<br/>     Counter Sheets, double-sided (3)<br/>     Soldier Cards, double-sided (126)<br/>     Action Cards (72)<br/>     Sheet of Hidden Setup Cards<br/>     Movement/Range Gauge (for miniatures)<br/><br/><br/>In addition to the print-and-play components, the option to purchase a set of professionally printed soldier cards is available. This deck of cards also includes hidden setup cards as well as a &ldquo;marker test&rdquo; card that can be used to test the ability to remove wet-erase or grease pencil marks from the cards before possibly damaging the soldier cards.<br/><br/>NOTE: Testing on cards purchased from WargameVault indicate that &quot;ultra-clean washable markers&quot; (such as those available from Crayola) or &quot;china pencils&quot; are the best options. Dry-erase markers should NOT be used as the ink stains the cards.<br/><br/>Fire your powered armor, heat up your weapon pack, and prepare for mayhem in the wasteland with M.A.A.S.

Let's do our best today to sort the rabbits and cats.<br/><br/>The rabbit has long ears and a short tail, and the cat has short ears and a long tail. Everyone knows it. But this is difficult.<br/><br/>In this game, the lead player plays any one card and declare whether it&rsquo;s a cat or a rabbit.  Afterwards, each following player must player a cat (long tail, short ear) or a rabbit (long ear, short tail) accordingly.  If they cannot play the required animal, they either play a rabbit/cat to lose a trick and hands black chips to other players or play a new species and make a trump in order to win the trick.  The card with highest trump or highest responsibility value wins.  If all player can play a card of the needed animal, bonus points (2 white chips) will be given.<br/><br/>At the end of a round, the single player with the most collected black chips do not score points; otherwise, each white chip scores 1 point.<br/><br/>Thus, in this game, the player would like to declare an animal that every other player can follow.<br/><br/>",

        "description": "Metal Melee is a multiplayer card game for 2-4 players that uses AI-generated artwork and strategic card abilities. Players use cards depicting Robots and Mechanical Titans to assemble an army and fight each other on the battlefield of Mechs. The objective is to defeat all other players' Bots and collect the most Power Shards from the Bots and Titans you destroy, emerging as the Metal Monarch and the champion of all things metal.<br/><br/>Featuring 176 playable cards, where no two Bot, Titan, Utility, and Pilot cards are the same, all with beautiful artwork and abilities geared for maximum mechanical mayhem. Metal Melee is for avid players of competitive card games and new players alike. Our mission is to develop a game with enough depth and variety to keep you coming back for more, all with a short and comprehensive rulebook so that you can break it out even at your more casual game night and introduce new players to a match of robot fisticuffs.<br/><br/>The first to collect 12 Power Shards from destroyed bots is the winner unless a player is the first to raise an army of 6 Bots and 1 Titan. Players start the game by selecting between three game modes and building their decks in either a random build, grid draft, or one collectively shared deck. Players then choose a Power Plant, which has unique abilities to be used throughout the game and generates Energy for you to use each round. Improve your Energy Production by drawing Energy Crystal cards from a stack of cards adjacent to your deck called your Power Mine and then attaching them to your Power Plant. Alternatively, you may discard them from your hand to your Junkyard for a faster boost of Energy to be used that same turn. Play Bots and Titans from your hand onto your field to assemble your army. (Your field is made up of a front row that can hold 3 Melee Bots, and a back row of 3 Ranged Bots, with Support Bots that can go in either row. Titans are placed adjacent to these rows in their own designated space.) Utility cards can be played to help you maintain an edge over your opponents and protect your own field, and Pilot cards can be attacked by your Bots or Titans to grant them extra strengths or new abilities. Combat damage is determined one card at a time, with each card on your field selecting to do a basic attack or use any activated abilities. The player who reduces an opponent's Bot or Titan to 0 Health Points earns Power Shards equal to the value indicated on the destroyed card. Metal Melee is easy to pick up and learn, but challenging to master with its wide range of card interactions where no two Bot, Titan, Utility, and Pilot cards are the same.<br/><br/>While we celebrate the advancements and achievements of modern artificial intelligence and have made it a feature of the AI Edition of our game, rest assured, this could not have been developed without the countless hours of testing, iteration, prototyping, and the most essential ingredient; flesh-and-blood (with some sweat and tears too). We are also releasing Metal Melee: Pixeled Edition at the same time, with handmade art in the style of 80's arcade-style gaming featuring pixel-art-themed cards.<br/><br/>&mdash;description from the designer<br/><br/>",

        "description": "Jeu du Skating-Rink represents another form of Goose variant: the introduction of two tracks, each of 63 spaces. The players divide themselves into two opposing teams, each playing on a different track. Additional interest is provided by crossing the tracks: at these points, if the two teams come together, they &rdquo;come to grief and fall&rdquo; and both must start the game afresh. Other hazards are marked by red or blue numerals on the respective tracks, both tracks having the same set of hazards, though not in corresponding order. The hazards are illustrated by scenes near the space&rsquo;s number. For example, &quot;skater taking a rest - wait twice his turn to throw the dice&quot; occurs at space 43 blue, and space 10 red; &rdquo;a player who asks for a match and passes one turn&rdquo; occurs at blue 35 and red 47; while &quot;lost his purse - each player pays him 2 to help him out of his difficulty&quot; occurs at blue 27 and red 28. The game is won by reaching or surpassing space 63, so reverse overthrows are not played. There are no spaces in which the goose-doubling rule applies; in fact, the track length is the only connection with the classic Goose game. The firm of Saussine was one of the major French manufacturers of games between its founding in 1860 and closure in the 1960s. Their games are often original (the founder, Leon Saussine, held several patents) and are always attractive, making good use of chromolithography, as in the present exhibit. As well as catering for the French market, they aimed at an international clientele, here indicated by the fact that the separate rule sheet is printed in both French and English.<br/>(Adrian Seville)<br/><br/>",

Now there are fifty Event Cards, most of which have variables practically guaranteeing no two games can ever be alike.<br/><br/>Some of the original &ldquo;Episodes&rdquo; have been retained; others modified in a variety of ways, and still more are entirely new. From army ants and African killer bees, to encounters with Elephant, Cape Buffalo, Rhinoceros, and more, to up close confrontations with snakes, Pygmies, flash floods, mysterious strangers, traitors, mutineers, The &ldquo;King&rdquo; and &ldquo;Queen&rdquo; of the Jungle, and more to make your wild fights in the forest/bush/veldt even wilder!<br/><br/>An advantage of the Battle Event Deck over the original tables is that once a card has been drawn, it cannot be repeated.

        "description": "You are Master Udo, a martial arts master. To prove that you are the best martial arts master around, you must sequentially challenge and defeat four other martial arts masters.<br/><br/>Master Udo is a puzzly game about making combos. You start with 10 basic cards in your hand. Each card is separated into 2 halves: a condition and an effect. By placing cards covering the previous effect, Udo increases the length of their combo. This makes the combo stronger. However, as the combo gets larger, it gets harder to build due to the conditions. Some conditions include &quot;Odd&quot; (can only be played in an odd position in the combo), &quot;MAX 3&quot; (can only be played in a combo of length 3 or less), and &quot;No right&quot; (cannot be played in a combo with &quot;right arm&quot; or &quot;right leg&quot;).<br/><br/>There is no partial damage in this game, which means that it is often important to store up &quot;charge&quot; that can be spent to increase the length of a combo at critical moments. Charge can be gained by blocking attacks and by playing certain combos.<br/><br/>It is important to be efficient with card play because the top card of each combo gets discarded once that combo resolves. Additionally, failing to block an attack results in a specific card being discarded. If the player discards all their cards, they lose. Additionally, if they can't discard or exile (remove from discard) the correct card when getting hit, they lose. Once Udo defeats 4 masters, they win. Udo can choose to challenge weaker or stronger masters in any order, but choosing to challenge weaker masters may reduce the overall glory earned at the end of the game. Defeating a master allows Udo to learn their signature move, improving Udo's strength in future battles.<br/><br/>&mdash;description from the publisher<br/><br/>",

There are 4 legendary treasures, each with a different win condition once discovered. Each player can only obtain 1 win condition, and players do not know which one they will get until they find it.<br/><br/>This game is all about upgrading things. Players get cards and slide paperclips to track how far their upgrades have progressed. They must spend energy and/or money to upgrade stuff. Upgrades include things such as energy generation, cargo capacity (hand limit), drill (allows mining deeper), hull (allows selling of hazards), and the scanner (allows looking at the top cards of the deck).<br/><br/>The mining is represented by 4 decks of levels 1-4. The deeper levels require upgraded drills and more energy, but have better rewards. Players can sell their loot to gain more money, which is then used to upgrade their operation further.<br/><br/>Since players do not know their win condition in advance, there is an incentive to find it early and start working towards it, but this comes at the cost of being able to amass certain upgrades that are expensive but can quickly snowball.<br/><br/>&mdash;description from the designer<br/><br/>",

Thus, there are cards specifying Imperial German, Japanese, Russian, and British units, as well as those of the other participants. These are apportioned roughly to match the troops committed by each member, so that British, Russian, and Japanese, and US cards abound, while Italy, Austria, and France are proportionally fewer.<br/><br/>Their Chinese opponents, however, had their own divisions and factions, and these are represented by cards specifying Boxer units (the largest group), as well as others for Imperial Bannermen, the Kansu Braves, and those units from the various &quot;Westernized&quot; units with more modern weapons and training.<br/><br/>In effect, using the cards as played guarantees that both sides will find it harder to stick to any joint plan and end up going their own way, as was exactly the case so often.<br/><br/>Using authentic Boxer and Manchu flags for the period, as well as the Colors of the Coalition members and other period illustrations, the cards are especially atmospheric and will help to put your games notches higher for drama, excitement, and speed of play.<br/><br/>&mdash;description from the publisher<br/><br/>",

As with all TVAG Event Decks, these are not your Monopoly &quot;Chance Cards,&quot; nor are the effects of each the same from game to game--severities and benefits vary across a wide spectrum.<br/><br/>And the whimsy is still there... and the fun and a hint of Hollywood, too, but never so much as to spoil the game.<br/><br/>If playing in Afghanistan, Native Reinforcements can include Regular Foot, Horse, or Guns--but not so if elsewhere on The Grim. If the battle is in Winter, Blizzards and Frostbite can affect both sides, but the Imperials worst of all. British troops can even be introduced to the charms of the Camel Spider, the Pathan Rock Fall, and Jezail armed Snipers, while Afghan/Pathan Tribesmen can find their Black Powder is soot and ash sold them by an Infidel Dog, or that their Mullah's have one battle plan and their Hill Chieftain another, or that the Gurkha's facing them are going to blood their Kukri's today, no matter the cost!<br/><br/>And besides these and so many more jolly moments that could never appear in a standard war games scenario, there is a new feature in the NWF Event Deck added as a tribute to the late author of The Sword And The Flame<br/><br/>These six Cards, randomly distributed throughout the Deck among the others, bear the likenesses of some characters all Colonial War Gamers will know from beloved films, characters whom Sgt. Brom has encountered on the edges of the battlefield who carry special Intelligence for the British C-in-C concerning Reinforcements for the Imperial or Native Forces. Their numbers, type, the time of their Arrival and Entry Points will be reported some number of Turns in advance. For the first time with these Event Cards, the British Players can attempt to coordinate the time and place of new Units with their current forces to defeat the Hill Tribes, or, if it's the Afghans/Pathans who are about to be reinforced, move to prevent their arrival causing a disaster!<br/><br/>&mdash;description rom the publisher<br/><br/>",

        "description": "In 1998, could people remember the movie plots &amp; top-billed actors from the 40's, 50's, and 60's?  That would have been but a tiny challenge when this game was published, because fewer than 10% of the cards in this game rely on a familiarity with the likes of: Rex Harrison, Humphrey Bogart, Charleton Heston, and Cary Grant.<br/><br/>Action! leans HEAVILY into the popular movies of the 80's &amp; 90's, so the question today is: can YOU remember the movie plots &amp; top-billed actors from the 80's &amp; 90's?  (Were you even alive then?!)  If so, you're going to love both showing off your movie knowledge and laughing at yourself when you get stumped over the things you should totally have known.  Each movie has 3 clues given which make the right answer increasingly more obvious BUT worth fewer points.  (This is where all of those hours of movie watching finally become &quot;an investment&quot;, rather than &quot;a waste of time&quot;.)  15 points wins the game.<br/><br/>The tagline for this game says: &quot;It's a party in a box!&quot;  Remember when movies came in boxes too?  If so, you need to take this party OUT of the box &amp; have a great time with it...you may even want to rewatch a few classics after the &quot;action&quot; stops.<br/><br/>",

Your team of meeples spends time discovering the land, finding threatened dice species on the verge of collapse. Using dominoes to determine your actions and movement, you gather these species up and deliver them to field hospitals or back to pristine ecosystems where they can heal on their own and support the biodiversity of nearby ecosystems. The winner of the game is the team with the highest reputation points for healing and reestablishing these species on the map.<br/><br/>During the game, you have the opportunity to train your advanced workers, research to gain new special skills, exchange species in certain locations or with opponents, receive much needed supplies and transport from helicopter visits and, most important, bring the species you collect to the rehabilitation and restoration locations to ensure their very survival.<br/><br/>&mdash;description from the publisher<br/><br/>",

Players take on the roles of Thorgal, his wife Aaricia, their son Jolan, and Kriss&mdash;a deadly female warrior&mdash;, and go on a series of adventures.<br/><br/>The game consists of 7 (10 for the Gamefound edition) stand-alone scenarios, each taking roughly 90-120 minutes of play. Scenarios do not form a campaign nor have any legacy features, so they can be played by different playgroups and over an extended period of time.<br/><br/>Thorgal: The Board Game comes with a book of maps. Each scenario is played on a different map that players explore while fulfilling scenario goals and promises completely different adventures, hidden opportunities, and vivid characters. Players are free to choose whether they travel in one group or split to cover more areas at the same time. They also perform side quests that might help them win a scenario.<br/><br/>Another important feature in the game is the storybook containing narrative descriptions of the encounters that Characters make in each scenario. The adventures described in the book are specific to each scenario and Character, yet a lot of them are randomized within a scenario, offering higher replayability and allowing for repeated play. There are also Side Plots players can pursue to gain benefits and reveal additional pieces of the story.<br/><br/>Thorgal: The Board Game, while having a strong narrative element, offers a brand new, unique action selection mechanism. In this new mechanism, actions have varying power depending on which other actions have already been taken. Players carefully plan their strategy and sequence of actions taken, as this directly impacts the strength of the effect of each action. This creates an interesting decision space and makes each turn important for everyone at the table.<br/><br/>Another important mechanic involves Character development. Each character gains experience during the game and advances their abilities. This dynamic progress allows players to make meaningful decisions about how to develop their hero in the game. Characters gather resources and craft objects to help them survive in the dangerous world.<br/><br/>&mdash;description from the publisher<br/><br/>",

Letters placed on bonus positions get 2x and 3x points. All words must be found in the dictionary to be valid. Invalid words are removed. Any letters not on the board have their points deducted from the score. Each player marks their score on their scoring tracks.<br/><br/>After validation and scoring, return the letters to the common draw pile and start the app again.<br/><br/>WINNING:<br/><br/>After several main rounds, the first player to exceed 99 points causes the game to end.

And it can be seen in the need to gain eight tokens to win, where the tokens represent the eight square length of the board.<br/><br/>This game has five different character types: Monarchs, Bastions, Clerics, Huntsman, and Scouts. The Seven Crest Structure forces the players to only be able set 1 Monarch, 2 Bastions, 2 Clerics, and 2 Huntsman face-up to empty positions on their field. When playing these character types, Monarchs are played in a player&rsquo;s back row, disrupting and pressuring the opponent from afar, Warriors (the term comprising Bastions, Clerics, and Huntsman) are played in a players front row to battle the opponents Warriors, and the Scouts are played in the opponents front row causing light disruptions to the opponent.<br/><br/>To add another layer of complexity, there are three types of Tactic cards. Each type is played at different phases of the game and give bonuses according to their type. Offensive Tactics are played during a player&rsquo;s Set phase and give offensive bonuses, Defensive Tactics are played during a players Defense phase and give defensive bonuses, and Assistive Tactics are played during both the Set and Defense phase and give general bonuses.<br/><br/>",

This pack consists of instructions, and 100 small (42 x 62 mm) cards with letters, letter values, and illustrations by Tony Ross from David Walliams's book Awful Auntie. Also included is a list of words that are drawn from the [British] government's notes for Key Stage 1 and 2 spellings.<br/><br/>Games include:<br/><br/>CROSSWORD: Players take turns playing letters from their hand and a draw pile onto a growing crossword on the table, scoring the sum of the letters' values in the new word. When the deck runs out, the highest score wins.<br/><br/>WORD CHASE: Players each choose a 7-letter word from the word booklet, and then take turns in rummy-like play until they have the letters for their word in their hand.<br/><br/>WORD GRAB: All 100 letters are face down. Players take turns turning up one letter.  When someone sees a word that can be spelled, they call it out, collect the letters, and spell the word in front of them. You can also claim others' words by calling an anagram of their word, or by making a new word by adding new letters. When the cards are all face up, the player with the most letters wins.<br/><br/>GRID LOCK: 16 cards are placed in a 4x4 grid, and players write as many words as they can spell from those letters. In GRID LOCK II it's the same but with the requirement that letters be in an adjacent chain like Boggle.<br/><br/>SPELLBOUND: Four letters are placed on the table. In a turn a player places a letter on one of the four columns, at the top or bottom, and says a word that includes the letters in that column in that order. The first to empty their hand wins.<br/><br/>",

A rescue shuttle is sent from your space station, but with difficult terrain and unpredictable storms near the crash site the closest the shuttle can land is several miles from the crash site. Unprepared for the harsh planetary conditions your team must gather resources and collect parts of their crashed ship in order to survive. Players are encouraged to write their own story as they make decisions about how to survive. The game presents players with real, impactful choices that change the course of the game including their objectives, strategies, and challenges as the game progresses.<br/><br/>Escape from Atalix is a cooperative deck building game where players work together to survive and complete projects on the harsh surface of a distant planet. Each player manages their own deck of cards which they will use to move around the board, harvest resources, battle with hostile aliens, research the planets ecosystem, and upgrade capabilities with new cards.<br/><br/>Cards also represent energy, the more cards you have the more turns you can take before the ending the round forcing you to return to what's left of your ship. Each round that passes brings you closer to the brink of destruction. Researching the planet can help you upgrade your tools and increase your capabilities including the ability to retain cards between turns and add cards to your free play selection.<br/><br/>&mdash;description from the designer<br/><br/>",

Grow and consume mushrooms to level up your abilities. You must hurry because increasing pollution and destruction will damage your foraging grounds.<br/><br/>In Mushroom Foray, 5 decks of cards representing regions are positioned randomly in a horizontal line. Below the regions, players drive their run down vehicles laterally to forage the regions and swap treasures at trading tents. On their turn, players can either stay in their region to forage for 2 cards or move 1 space in either direction to forage for 1 card. Then, players can play action cards, trade, or grow mushrooms.<br/><br/>There are two types of action cards: Victory Cards and Ability Cards. Victory cards are played face up in front of the player who satisfies the mushroom requirements displayed on the card. For example, &ldquo;Save the Bees!&rdquo; card requires 1 Reshi mushroom tincture to play the victory card. The first player who plays 8 victory cards wins the game.<br/><br/>Chef Requests are a type of victory card that are satisfied by gathering the mushrooms needed for recipes. Deforestation, Contamination, and Plastic Waste are special victory cards called destruction cards that are randomly drawn from the burn, forest, river, and plains regions. After these cards are drawn, they must be placed face up on their associated region deck until a player can satisfy the restoration requirements. All players lose if the burn, forest, river, and plains regions all have unresolved destruction cards for a full turn.<br/><br/>Ability cards grant players special skills. Each player can only play 3 ability cards, so the players will need to choose the ability and timing carefully. Each ability card can be played after discarding the required mushroom icons representing the specific regions where the mushrooms were foraged. Magic mushrooms can satisfy any mushroom icon (plains, forest, river). Magic Mushrooms can also be spent to reactivate any 1 played abilities. The player immediately performs the ability card action after playing the card face up on the table. Then, the player can choose to perform any of their previously played abilities in any order. Finally, in turn order, any opponent sharing the same space of the player who played an ability can choose to perform any 1 of that player&rsquo;s abilities.<br/><br/>On their turn, players can also exchange cards from their hands with the trading tents. Tents are split into 2 halves with a number or symbol on each side. One half of the tent is always covered by cards. The numbers and symbols represent the required number and type of cards that can be traded for the cards presented on the other half of the tent. A player can place the required cards on one side of the tent to take the available cards.<br/><br/>Players will need to grow mushrooms to satisfy some of the victory cards. Each player has 4 cards arranged as a grow chamber: Prepare, Grow, Grain, and Tincture. At the start of the game, each of the grow chamber cards are greyed out. Players must satisfy the requirements to flip cards to activate each phase in the grow chamber. First, players must place a cultivatable mushroom (indicated by a mushroom icon) onto the Prepare card. Then, the player must discard the requirement cards to flip the Grow card. Now, the player will receive 1 mushroom token each turn onto the Grow card. Each mushroom token inherits the characteristics of the prepared mushroom card. Finally, the player can discard the requirements for the Grain and Tincture phases to flip their mushroom tokens into colonized grain or medicinal tinctures. Grain and tinctures are requirements for some victory cards.<br/><br/>The game immediately ends when a winning player has played 8 victory cards or when the burn, forest, river, and plains regions all have been damaged by destruction cards for a full turn. All players lose if the second condition is met.<br/><br/>-description from designer<br/><br/>",

Red is used for cards ruled by Fire (wands/clubs), Blue for Water (cups/hearts), Yellow for Air (swords/spades), and Green for Earth (pentacles/diamonds).<br/><br/>The Trio Play Tarot Deck can also be used as a standard deck of playing cards. The Knights and the Major Arcana cards have a design that readily distinguishes them from the cards you need while playing games like Gin Rummy or Poker. These differences in the design allow them to be easily found and removed when you are ready to play.<br/><br/>Thirdly, the design of the Trio Play Deck allows for it to be played as a color/number matching game similar to public domain games such as Crazy 8's created in the 1930's and Mau Mau created in the 1950's or other popular multi-color matching games like Uno created in the 1970's. The Trio Play is a shedding type card game in which the player's objective is to empty one's hand of all cards before the other players have a chance to.<br/><br/>The Trio Play deck uses action cards similar to the German game Mau Mau where you can inflict penalties on the other players forcing them to skip a turn, change/switch the order of play, or force the next player to draw two to four cards.  Wild cards have also been borrowed from traditions such as Joker's Wild or 8's being Wild in Crazy 8's, allowing you to use those cards in place of any color/number card you might need to continue your hand without adding more cards.<br/><br/>&mdash;description from the designer<br/><br/>The rules for the Trio Play deck are not in the card deck box, but available online.<br/><br/>The designer, Matt Green, is a graphic designer who also did the graphical design of the cards.<br/><br/>&mdash;user summary<br/><br/>",

        "description": "Expanded to 112 pages, We Only Kill Each Other has improved text and some clarified rules, but the real change is the addition of two entirely new sections.<br/><br/>&quot;Hood's Life&quot; provides rules that allow players' Characters with activities not directly involved with the crimes they commit, but rather ways to fill their time away from the &quot;job.&quot; Gangster, Hoodlum, or even Cop, his or her &quot;Reputation&quot; can be vital to success, and must be built and protected to increase authority and bring greater rewards. Police can even win Medals! &quot;Friends and Foes&quot; will inevitably be made, people to keep close, and others to keep closer as they can aid your climb in the Underworld or Law Enforcement--or bring you down. And what do you do with your crime generating money? &quot;Living Within Your Means&quot; provides the incentive to keep making more money--especially when it's running short. But that same money permits a crook the opportunity for &quot;Living Large&quot;--enjoying that flow of cash and helping build the kind of Reputation that serves him best. Not exactly a pastime, but giving &quot;The Look&quot; is an Underworld tradition that can cow enemies without direct use of violence. Other rules include how to conduct &quot;Extortion&quot; through the threat and use of violence, the effects and results of facing &quot;Prosecutions,&quot; including conviction, prison time or even The Chair, and &quot;Wound Recovery&quot; so that injuries suffered in a previous game can determine how long to heal--or how quickly they prove fatal. Finally, there are extensive rules for the effects of Newspapers on careers, as well as how a Reporter/Photographer can participate in raids and gun battles between Law Enforcement and Gangsters. All of these rules allow players to determine the fate of their Characters through their life in crime.<br/><br/>The other new section is &quot;Dillinger Days--Life On The Run,&quot; rules for organizing one's own career as a bank robber, and even building a gang of his own. From starting with their &quot;Wheels,&quot; to choosing a Hideout, planning and executing a bank heist, and making a getaway only to plan the next one, everything is there. New Game Maps provide the &quot;Tri-State&quot; area in which to conduct your own Crime Spree, with &quot;Risks of The Road&quot; and the chance of The Law in &quot;Hot Pursuit,&quot; using a new Game Card Deck (sent free for the asking), while racing through city streets. Figuring and dividing &quot;The Take,&quot; &quot;Hiding Out&quot; while &quot;The Heat&quot; is on, and always the danger that you or one of your gang will be &quot;Fingered,&quot; bringing Law Enforcement down on you.<br/><br/>In short, WOKEO is the most complete set of miniatures wargame rules on the subject of Crime and Law Enforcement of the era ever.<br/><br/>WOKEO has been in development for over fifteen years with an emphasis on &quot;realism,&quot; rather than Hollywood and legend. It's a fast-paced game of criminal-on-criminal violence with the possible involvement of law enforcement. Other rules make no distinctions between three distinct &quot;theaters&quot; in this era of criminal enterprise with the common denominator of violence--&quot;Beers Wars,&quot; (1920-1933), &quot;Dillinger Days&quot; (1934-35), and &quot;Mafia Wars&quot; (1931-35). Each has distinctive features making it unique regarding characters and possible games.<br/><br/>Characters are generated in detail by types/classes (but don&rsquo;t think of D&amp;D!)&mdash;gangsters, hoodlums, police, detectives, FBI and Treasury Agents, each with the opportunity for skills, areas of special knowledge, and even weaponry by period and subject. Distinguishing Features, including Peculiarities/Personality Quirks/Addictions/Compulsive Behaviors, Speech Impediments, as well as detailed physical attributes and Criminal Records, are just some of the descriptors that will apply.<br/><br/>WOKEO recognizes that such criminals are not soldiers, responding to orders and formal leadership. They tend to be violent, under-educated, and commonly unintelligent, striking by stealth and surprise, rather than seeking stand up battles. &quot;Discipline and duty&quot; do not characterize them, while opportunism and fear of retaliation does.<br/><br/>Combat rules are fast and deadly, with a wide variety of basic weapon types available&mdash;but players can rarely make the choice. Tommy Guns, and BARs are &quot;terror weapons,&quot; and far more rare than Hollywood pretends. You won't find one often, but when you do, watch out!<br/><br/>A &quot;Director&quot; can create the episode, but &ldquo;pick-up&rdquo;games are easy--just use any of the pre-generated Characters that come with the game, or roll up your own. Play is card driven, cuing individual Characters to declare and carry out their Actions. Almost everything--use of &quot;Mitts,&quot; &quot;Pins,&quot; &quot;Moxie,&quot; &quot;Brains&quot; and &quot;Brawn&quot;--is determined successful or not by a single D10 roll with limited modifiers&mdash;no combat results tables, no formulae, just down and dirty quick results with a system quickly learned. No written orders, just a few items to mark off on each Character Record Card.<br/><br/>Players normally play one Character, but up to four are possible. Rules for &quot;Extras&quot;--simplified Characters operating in groups--can allow larger games, but most games need fewer than a half-dozen figures to a side, though police can show up in numbers if a crime is still in progress.<br/><br/>There are detailed rules for Drive By Shootings, Automobile pursuits and Collisions, Tear gas, explosives, body armor, brawling, &quot;gun molls,&quot; and optional rules for specific Wound Location/Effects, Rescue of the wounded, use of the garrote, and more make WOKEO a complete package.<br/><br/>WOKEO also recognizes &quot;Square Johns&quot;&mdash;civilians who can as easily fall victim to the police as the criminals--as key elements. Pedestrian and Vehicular &ldquo;Panic&rdquo; rules guarantee chaos in the streets with the very real risk of them becoming unwitting targets--and not just of the criminals. But Law Enforcement bullets are just as deadly!<br/><br/>Police, FBI and Treasury Agents all have their own rules. Police use of &quot;The Third Degree&quot; during interrogations can be part of the game, as well as the competition between &quot;G-Men&quot; and local police. And if you think the &quot;G-Men&quot; were Supermen from the start, think again. WOKEO does not depict things the way Mr. Hoover would have wanted it to!<br/><br/>&ldquo;We Only Kill Each Other,&quot; (unlike the author&rsquo;s own &ldquo;Gangbusters&rdquo; from TSR eons ago), makes no attempt to include the economics of organized crime. It is strictly for flying lead, racing automobiles, and blood on the sidewalk. WOKEO literally allows players to &quot;cut to the chase&quot; and engage in all the mayhem Prohibition and Depression era crime has to offer. With all the gory details, this is easily the grittiest miniatures game of criminal violence yet.<br/><br/>The rules come with three introductory Scenarios, one for &ldquo;Beer Wars,&rdquo; one for &ldquo;Dillinger Days,&rdquo; and one for &ldquo;Mafia Wars.&rdquo; Each provides full information on necessary Characters, figures, sets, vehicles, and more. There are schematics, photos, tables, information for each side, as well as &quot;secret&quot; information for the Director. No Scenario can play the same way twice.<br/><br/>WOKEO also addresses the urban environment central to crime of the period. Police call boxes, sirens, alarms, police whistles, auto and pedestrian traffic (varying by neighborhood and time of day) all are part of the mix when perpetrating or confronting crime in the streets. The rules are designed for use with model buildings like those from Old Glory, Reviresco, and TVAG's own &ldquo;Mean Streets&rdquo; and &ldquo;Mean Sets,&quot; but the use of 2D maps of the players' own devising is covered.<br/><br/>Street Schematics are provided for planning of hits and/or law enforcement raids, and a full page city street map of &ldquo;Newcago,&rdquo; locating key addresses, public buildings, and businesses provides the wider environment where Bootlegger gangs can vie for control through beatings, bombings, and shootings.<br/><br/>Other features include a comprehensive list of 28mm gangster/law enforcement figures manufacturers, as well as buildings and vehicles. There are also lists of useful Websites, movies of particularly inspirational value, and a section showing how easy--and fun!--designing your own scenarios can be.<br/><br/>&mdash;description from the publisher<br/><br/>",

A fellow player slips into the role of the clueless DUMMBATZ and tries to guess the term he is looking for based on clues from the other players. But be careful! All players must try to unmask the DUMMBATZ and lead him on the ice. This game is tactical, exciting, fast and loose and provides rousing party fun for the next game night. Thanks to the included writing boards and foil pens for up to 8 players, nothing stands in the way of instant fun.<br/><br/>Gameplay<br/><br/>The first player first gets all the boards, draws a DUMMBATZ card and chooses one of the five terms. Then he writes his chosen term on the empty player boards. The person sitting next to him shuffles the remaining player boards together with the DUMMBATZ board and distributes them among the other players. The player who got the DUMMBATZ board is the DUMMBATZ this round. Now the player who chose the term names the rubric and the teammate to his left is the first to name a descriptive tip that has anything to do with the term on his board. Then the other players follow one after the other with their tips. The DUMMBATZ now tries to guess which term is being searched for on the basis of the tips given. When it is the DUMMBATZ's turn, he must also try to describe the term he is looking for without being recognized as a DUMMBATZ.

The board is glued into the the game box base. It appears that the game play and layout is identical to that of the Whitman Kentucky Derby game<br/><br/>Players take it in turns to spin the Spinner which has 5 horses name. The horse name that comes up advances that horse one space down the slotted track. This is repeated until a horse crosses the finish post first and that player is the winner.<br/><br/>Of historical interest is the plastic horse names which were Melbourne Cup winners between 1951 and 1955. The Melbourne Cup is the richest 2 mile horse race in the world, first held in 1861.<br/><br/>&mdash;user summary<br/><br/>",

Together, each pair of cards show a number which determines the value of the item up for auction.<br/><br/>The noun deck is formed from cards which each player sees some of privately.  Part way through the game, this deck stops being revealed until the item has been auctioned.<br/><br/>Players start the game with 10 coins and cannot gain additional money.<br/><br/>The player with the most points when all items have been auctioned wins.<br/><br/>",

You shall take an offering from every man that gives it willingly with his heart. And this is the offering which you shall take of them: gold, and silver, and bronze, and blue, and purple, and scarlet, and fine linen, and goats' hair, and rams' skins dyed red, and fine leather, and acacia-wood, oil for the light, spices for anointing oil and for sweet incense, onyx stones, and stones to be set in the ephod and in the breastplate. And let them make Me a Sanctuary, so that I may dwell among them.' &rdquo; (Exodus 25:1-8)<br/><br/>Each player takes control of a Tribe, and beginning with three, will collect resources by either rolling each Tribe member's die or placing their die on the Action Board and use those resources to expand their tribe and fill requirements for the construction of the Tabernacle. Resources have differing values and will receive varying points by placing them on the Tabernacle Board, thus bringing the game to an end when all spaces are filled. Through strategic use of resources and a bit of luck, the Tribe with the most points at this time will be declared the winner!<br/><br/>&mdash;description from the publisher<br/><br/>",

Victory may go to the last fighter standing, but it may also go to the most aggressive fighter, whether or not that fighter is conscious at the end, so do not back down.<br/><br/>Pearwood House Rules of Combat is a card-driven martial-arts-style combat game with a unique focus on positioning and fighter-fighter interaction.  Your every attack, every defense, every push and shift will move you and your opponent around the platform.  Your opponent's responses will set up new positions for you to consider.  Smash your foes into obstacles, throw them off the platform, or send your weapon through their defenses and send them stumbling.<br/><br/>You must manage your supply of move cards, build up focus by employing the proper stance, rid yourself of seemingly never-ending fatigue cards, and, ideally, keep your endurance above 0 to stay conscious.  Amass aggression tokens to win... or you could just knock everyone else out, but with only 4 rounds to do so, you'd have to go hard.<br/><br/>&mdash;description from the designer<br/><br/>",

At the same time, the players have to keep an eye on their money reserves and invest them efficiently and strategically.<br/><br/>However, natural disasters such as floods, desertification, or forest fires keep putting obstacles in the way.<br/><br/>The challenge is to earn enough money to avoid going bankrupt, but also not to focus on making too much money, otherwise, you will damage the climate and lose out. In addition, you have to focus on innovative ideas, which are a bit more expensive than CO₂ cards, but more climate-friendly. For every 5 monetary points you gain, you will be credited with one climate point at the end. In the end, whoever has collected the most climate points wins.<br/><br/>",

        "description": "Buy Weapons, Beat Monsters, Earn a Promotion!<br/>Experience the thrill of battling monsters and shopping for office supplies in A.O.L.S., an office life simulator where you and your coworkers must help in the recapture of subjects purposely released as part of an emergency release exercise, all while vying for Workers Points to impress the higher-ups and earn a promotion.<br/><br/>Summary<br/>The game A.O.L.S. (An Office Life Simulator) is a board game where players are employees who are tasked with helping in the recapture of subjects that were purposely released as part of an emergency release exercise by their company's new owner, the Super Cool Place. The game has a cyclic pattern of shop phase, battle phase, and a &quot;coffee break&quot; phase. In the shop phase, workers point coins can be spent in the company shop in exchange for items, equipment, coupons, and even performance bonus cards. In the battle phase, players fight one monster from the monster pile using their equipment and office supplies card. Players will have a certain number of rounds to beat the monster, and the player with the most worked hours this week goes first. The game rewards workers points to those who excel in the assignment and perform the best, with the possibility of a promotion.<br/><br/>Lore<br/>You are an ordinary office worker. The office building next door, dubbed the Super Cool Place, started the day by running a planned emergency release exercise of important monst- er, &ldquo;Subjects&rdquo; kept there. As a part of this planned emergency release exercise, the Super Cool Place has temporarily bought out your company and all of its employees. With new management comes a restructuring of the chain of command. Help in the recapture of these subjects to earn Workers Points. Spend these Worker's Points at the company shop to obtain office supplies to help in the recapture of another subject. Sell equipment and items earned in battle to obtain more Workers Points. The employee who impresses management the most after 4 battles will finally earn the promotion of their dreams! (Wins!)<br/><br/>So I asked Chat GTP what the &quot;best&quot; part of this game was...<br/>&quot;As an AI language model, I don't have personal experiences or preferences like humans do, so I cannot determine what the best part of the game is. However, I can tell you that the game seems to have a variety of mechanics, such as collecting cards, equipping equipment, battling monsters, and using office supplies, which could provide players with different ways to strategize and interact with each other. The game also seems to have a currency system, workers points, which can be used to buy items from the shop or gain performance bonus cards, providing players with another layer of decision-making. Ultimately, the best part of the game would depend on the individual player's interests and preferences.&quot;<br/><br/>&mdash;desription from the designer<br/><br/>",

A player gives clues to his teammates to try to complete a challenge.<br/><br/>Examples of challenges are: use a designated word in the grid in a sentence that describes a targeted word on the challenge card; use an internet meme or emoji to describe a word in the grid; use a simile or metaphor to identify a word in the grid; and draw a sketch or act out a scene that will describe a word in the grid. Discard used grid words and replenish the grid.<br/><br/>Once a team has completed 4,5, or 6 challenge types (depending upon how difficult the players want the game to be), that team attempts a Final Word Duel in which one of the discarded grid words is secretly chosen, and three clues, based on a die roll, are given about the word. The clues will be to state a synonym or antonym of the word or to designate the position of a vowel or consonant in the word. The first team to succeed in the Final Word Duel wins.<br/><br/>",

If you like a challenge play Spellbound The New Word Spelling Game!<br/><br/>This game is actually 30 years from creation to completion and packaging.

The other friend took the idea and made it a dream come true when the prototype was sent for manufacturing. The game was printed and packaged in 2014 for sale.

It is a variation on a more common roll-and-move game with the same theme, but this is the only version to feature art by A. Barsukov.<br/><br/>In the game, players are trying to get to the Lightning Theater. On their turn, each player draws a card to see how they will move. The cards are portraits of Buratino and other characters from the book, along with a colored circle and a number. If the card shows a blue circle, the player moves their counter that many spaces forward. If it shows a red circle, they move that many spaces back. If it shows a yellow circle, the players lose a turn.<br/><br/>Similarly, landing on a space with a blue star allows players to hop forward to the next blue-star space. A yellow-star space forces players to lose a turn.<br/><br/>The game includes a three-dimensional toy theater element. At the end of play, the winner is encouraged to set up the three included standees - Buratino, Pierrot, and Malvina - in a little scene in the Lightning Theater.<br/><br/>&mdash;user summary<br/><br/>",

Each turn represents an academic year in which the player will choose one of four strategic focuses (actions) for their university. When selecting a focus, players choose one of the four offices at their university. Each ready staff member in that office works, triggering its effect. Each focus requires players to exhaust staff, meaning the game is about managing which staff are ready and when, and over the course of play players develop Ph.D. programs, raise endowments, use committees, hire staff, promote individuals, increase the size of the student body, and so on.<br/><br/>Every four years, students will graduate and affect their university's reputation: star athletes improve athletics reputation, high performers academic reputation, and so on. Players then admit new students, and begin again. After three cohorts of students have graduated, players score prestige from reputation, communications efforts, faculty committees, and size/popularity, then the most prestigious university wins.<br/><br/>&mdash;description from the designer<br/><br/>",

Special milestones await players who risk earning SIN to advance ahead of the others.<br/><br/>At the start of the game, players will each receive a diary. Inside, you will have to create a tableau of cards to plan your day in hell. By adding these cards, you will establish your current and upcoming actions. When each day comes to an end, turn the page of your diary, and witness new actions unfold right before your eyes, leading to a fresh turn/day.<br/><br/>The main actions are:<br/><br/>     Movement (clockwise or counterclockwise), triggering events, traps, or milestones.<br/>     Drawing: Stack cards on the right page of your agenda for when you turn the page.<br/>     Help: Assist the last player on the board, helping them, and gain FAITH (VP).<br/><br/><br/>",

The object of the game is to be the first player to go out, but you can't go out without the Cowbell - and there's only ONE Cowbell Card in the deck.  You must have this card in order to play your last card and win the game, so everyone is trying to get their hands on the Cowbell Card and then go out of the game while they have it.  Players can steal the Cowbell from each other and the Cowbell can be rotated into or away from your hand depending on action cards played during a round.<br/><br/>The 57-card deck is made up of crazy cow characters like Cowabunga, Holy Cow, Cow Poke, Mad Cow and more!  Action cards include the Horseshoe Magnet, Don't Have a Cow, Cow Tippin', Milk It and Beef It Up - all with different actions that keep things mooooooooving right along!<br/><br/>Games can last anywhere from 2 minutes to 10 minutes - simply deal 7 cards to each player to start the game and take turns discarding matching scenes, characters, magnets or wild cards.  Get the Cowbell and try to go out before someone steals it from you.  If you don't have a play, draw until you do...it's sheer cow madness!<br/><br/>&mdash;description from the designer<br/><br/>",

        "description": "How are Rainbows made?? Magical dragons race across sky chasing storms and leaving rainbows in their trail.<br/><br/>Rainbow Dragons is a fun set collection game with 6 color dice that is great for kids but has the strategic depth for adults too.<br/><br/>The game plays 3-6 players, setup is fast, games are quick, easy to learn and makes a great filler game at 25-45 minutes.<br/><br/>On your turn you roll a single rainbow die. It will show one of 6 colors that you can collect and create sets. If you like the die you put it down on your score card.<br/><br/>Otherwise you can offer the die to another player. If they say yes then you give them the die and they add it to their score card. After they accept your die you then roll 2 dice. You can now add those dice to your card or trade them for even more dice.<br/><br/>Players have to use strategy to know when to offer a die, when to say yes and when to say no. If a player says no the die goes back to the dice pool and it is lost to the player who rolled it. A player can continue to roll dice as long as the other players are willing to trade.<br/><br/>Once on your turn you can turn in a set of dice for points. You will get more points for higher sets of dice with the largest reward going to a complete rainbow (1 die of each of the colors). Your score is impacted by your neighbors dice so you are always watching what the other dragons are doing.<br/><br/>When you turn in a set you advance your marker down the scoring track towards the win. First player to the end wins the game immediately. The game also ends with the 3 rainbow or when there are no more dice when a player needs to roll. At this point the player with the most points wins.<br/><br/>-description from designer<br/><br/>",

The objective of the game is to win by forming valid combinations of cards.<br/><br/>The game's core cards are 20 command cards that represent Linux terminal commands. The 18 Option cards add more options to the game, and the 12 Path cards provide different ways for players to complete their combinations. The four Special cards increase the game's complexity.<br/><br/>The gameplay of RUN ME is simple, yet challenging. Each player is dealt five cards, and the remaining cards are placed face down to form a draw pile. Players take turns to draw one card from the draw pile and either discard a card from their hand and play a valid combination of cards. The game develops as players strategically discard or keep cards in hand, making calculations based on the cards they have, as well as the ones they still need to form a valid combination.

The knowledge category tests your musical knowledge and the conductor category sees you conducting an appropriate beat. You advance 1-3 fields if you answer or solve your task correctly.<br/><br/>First player making it to the finish wins the golden PARTYtur.<br/><br/>In a solo game you play against the conductor and need to reach the finish before the conductor finishes the rehearsal (measured by metronome tokens)<br/><br/>",

As the commander of this stranded fleet, you stand at the edge of a wormhole that, if piloted correctly, can bring you back to Earth's solar system. However, navigating this wormhole is no easy task, as it is fraught with peril and unforeseen challenges. Only the most courageous and strategic commanders will be able to steer their spaceships through the wormhole and lead their crews back home. Are you prepared to prove your commanding skills and seize the opportunity to return home?<br/><br/>Your fleet comprises substantial motherships representing Earth, the Moon, and Mars, along with smaller companion spaceships. Your objective is to chart a course through the wormhole, aiming to land on a planet or dock at a space station within our home solar system. But beware, a cosmic storm looms, and once all spaceships have ventured into the wormhole, any that remain unlanded, undocked, or outside the safe zone will face destruction.<br/><br/>Can you rise to the challenge, emerge triumphant, and become the commander with the highest glory?<br/><br/>At the start of the game, you have the option to choose between a short, a normal, or a legendary game, which determines the number of missions you will play.<br/><br/>At the beginning of each mission, one starting condition card, one special rule card, and one victory point card are drawn. The starting condition card indicates the composition of your fleet for the upcoming mission, specifying which ships and how many are available to you. The special rule card modifies the game mechanics in a specific way. The victory point card determines the glory point values assigned to different types of ships.<br/><br/>During your turn, you select one of your ships (represented by discs) and flick it, aiming to successfully land the ship in a valid location.<br/><br/>The mission concludes once every player has played all of their ships (flicked all discs). At the end of a mission, each player tallies their glory points. The player with the highest glory points emerges as the winner of that mission. After completing a number of missions equal to the specified requirement for the chosen game mode (best of 3, best of 5, or best of 10), the player who has accumulated enough victories to secure an insurmountable lead becomes the ultimate commander and wins the game.<br/><br/>&ndash;description from designer<br/><br/>",

        "description": "The capital of Avalon is currently at the center of Fire Magic discovery. Mages from all over the land come to the capital to learn about Fire Magic and find new ways of spell casting in the Burning Tower of Avalon. As such, there are many disasters caused primarily by novices practicing their spell casting. To remedy this situation, an experienced group of mages known as &quot;FIRE RESCUE MAGES&quot; was formed by the Council of High Magic. Their role is to combat these accidental fires and rescue anyone trapped within the fiery tower.<br/><br/>Your task as a Fire Rescue Mage is to: Enter the burning tower, Rescue all trapped mages (Victims), and Lead them out of the tower safely. Unfortunately, fire creatures are very attracted to magical fires and can even be summoned by accident, so you will need to be cautious and prepared to combat these creatures while keeping your survivors safe.<br/><br/>&mdash;description from the designer<br/><br/>Official link to game<br/><a target='_blank' href=\"https://thekealf.itch.io/fire-rescue-mages\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer noopener\">https://thekealf.itch.io/fire-rescue-mages</a><br/><br/>",

You take on the role of Spellcasters who venture into the dark halls of the library and search the numerous rooms for rare spells and mysterious items. Your goal: find 5 magic keys of the same kind and be the first to use them to open the gate and win the game!<br/><br/>During your turn, you can perform up to 3 actions. The fundamental action is movement. Throw two dice and walk up up to as many fields as you rolled. When you reach the edge of a room, reveal the next room card and place it adjacent to yours. In each room you'll find bookshelves - when standing next to one, perform the loot action and draw up to two cards from the pile. You can loot not only the aforementioned keys, but also spells, instant spells and different magical relics.<br/>Another basic action is casting spells: play one of your spell cards and perform its effect. There's a wide variety of spells. You can for example steal 2 cards from other players, teleport to a specific room, switch places with other game pieces or create fire in a room of your choosing. Other minor actions include equipping a relic card for a permanent buff or manipulating an obstacle in the nearby labyrinth.<br/><br/>But not only the other adventurers will use magic to obstruct your quest and try to win the game before you. The library itself is protected by something ancient - the guardians. Once their room cards are unveiled, they will focus and you and hunt you down. The more you discover the library, the more numerous and powerful they become. For each active guardian in the game, they gain an additional die for their walk actions. So, run away, use spells and obstacles to slow them down or shift their focus to your competitors.<br/><br/>The game ends when one of you manages to escape the library by opening the gate of knowledge with the five keys required. Or, the guardians catch all of you and trap you in the labyrinth for all eternity.<br/><br/>-description from the publisher<br/><br/>",

When, if for any reason, there are two copies of a card in someones' yard, resolve the card if it's being effect is being used, then immediately Bury the cards by flipping them over and putting them under your Dog card.

Inside this box, you&rsquo;ll come across all sorts of weird and wonderful rhyming charades.<br/><br/>From &ldquo;Moby Dick using his selfie stick&rdquo; to &ldquo;Angelina Jolie eating ravioli&rdquo;, &ldquo;King Kong playing ping pong&rdquo; to &ldquo;Bob Marley riding a harley&rdquo;.<br/><br/>Your job is to describe these rhymes to your team by either acting them out, reading a riddle or explaining them without using any of the words on the card. Each round, you&rsquo;ll have 30 seconds. Get your team to successfully shout out three rhymes and you&rsquo;ll get to hunt for one of the matching rhyming pairs which lie face-down on the table. At the end of the game, the team that uncovers the most matching pairs, wins!<br/><br/>So if you&rsquo;re looking to mix-up the traditional family games night and watch your grandpa mime out &lsquo;Frankenstein drinking a bottle of wine&rsquo;, then this might be the game for you. Although, just a reminder: this is a game about shouting out all sorts of strange rhymes... so you might want to give the neighbours a heads-up first.<br/><br/>",

The National Hockey League Game offers endless changes to develop plays on attacks and defense, just as in the real game played on the ice.&quot; - From intro of rulebook<br/><br/>Players control their Forwards (3), Defensemen (2) and Goalkeeper (1). The players are simultaneously attacking and defending. Forwards try to get across the goal crease line past the defense and the goalkeeper. This will score a goal but 2 forwards must be past the blueline for this to count, otherwise it is offside. The defense can &quot;check&quot; the forwards by landing on the same square occupied by a forward which sends them back to their starting location. Goalies are restricted to movement inside the goal crease only and can make saves by &quot;blocking&quot;.<br/><br/>All movement for the game is done with dice. The game's length can be set beforehand between both players but it is recommended to do a &quot;best out of ___&quot; style game of 3, 5, 7 etc goals.<br/><br/>",

In the game, each player tries to be the first to collect 3 gemstone cards of the same kind.<br/><br/>The game starts with the deck of cards in the center, face down. Each player takes a turn picking a card from the pile. That card can be a Gem (12 different gems) or a special card (attack, defense, joker card). Depending on the card, the player may wish to use it immediately (e.g. change the gem type they are collecting, add it to their existing collection if it fits, play it against others etc), keep it for later (for non-gem cards only), discard (&quot;burn&quot;) it or put it at the bottom of the pile (&quot;stash&quot;).<br/><br/>The game ends when someone collects 3 same gem cards, or if the pile runs out. In the latter case, the winner is determined by the number of gems they have, the number of  attacks they successfully thwarted and/or the number of attacks they didn't block. If all else fails, the winner is determined by the type of gem they were collecting when the pile ran out.<br/><br/>One game will typically run for about 10-20 minutes, depending on how fast the players are, and how many players are in the game. It is easy to grasp, fast-paced, with quite a few hints of strategy, but luck also plays some part.<br/><br/>&mdash;description from the designer<br/><br/>",

Each player places their token on the START space facing them.<br/><br/>HOW TO PLAY<br/><br/><br/>     Both players roll their corresponding die at the same time. For example: if a player's token is on the d8 space, they roll a d8.<br/>     The player with the lower value moves their token closer to the edge of the cliff.<br/>     If both values are a tie, nothing happens.<br/>     CRITICAL HIT: If the value rolled by a player is the highest value possible for their die, their opponent moves their token closer to the edge of the cliff unless they are on the last space (d20).<br/>     CRITICAL MISS: If the value rolled by a player is a 1, they move their own token closer to the edge of the cliff unless they are on the last space (d20).<br/>     First player to reach the SKULL loses!<br/><br/><br/>&mdash;description from the designer<br/><br/>",

        "description": "Armoured Storm: The Eastern Front is a quick-playing, simple-to-learn game of tank-versus-tank combat in World War Two. The rules are intended for battles between 15 and 30 tanks per side, plus 4 or 5 HQ tanks. This means, in game terms, that each player will command one or more companies of tanks organized into several platoons.<br/><br/>In Armoured Storm, you take the role of a commander first and a gunner/driver second. Your ability to give the right orders at the right time and bring your available firepower to bear more efficiently than your opponent, are more important at the level of command you&rsquo;re representing. Out-thinking your opponent by being clear about your goals and through clever use of the Tactics Chart will bring you success.<br/><br/>THE &lsquo;YOU COMMAND&rsquo; SERIES<br/>&lsquo;You Command&rsquo; is a series of light wargames by Daniel Mersey. When you play a &lsquo;You Command&rsquo; game, your goal is to defeat your opponent by out-thinking them tactically using the innovative Tactics Chart, and then by out-fighting their model army on the tabletop battlefield.<br/><br/>Please note that all Armoured Storm titles share the same basic rules; optional rules and tank stats are different according to the theatre of war.<br/><br/>&mdash;description from the publisher<br/><br/>",

In a short time, thanks to their efforts, Italy was ousted from the conflict and the Allies returned to European continent, definitely arresting the expansion of the Axis.<br/><br/>This game allows to recreate events which took place between 1943 and 1945, when this area became the epicenter of some of the most bloody battles of the WW2.<br/><br/>The game uses wooden cubes, square counters and circular<br/>markers together. It is for two players and lasts about an hour on average. The map is zoned.<br/><br/>The game lasts 8 rounds divided into impulses; with each impulse the players take turns moving and fighting with their specialized forces, blocks and counters.<br/><br/>Whoever controls the majority of areas marked with a star (Rome, Tunis, Naples, Munich and so on) wins the game.<br/><br/>The blocks can be converted with specialized units, like tanks and aircraft; each with its own conversion cost.<br/>The combat mechanic is very simple: at the end of the movement I place one of the three attack arrows and start rolling the dice, one for each attacking cube; if a 6 is rolled then he inflicts a loss on the enemy. If tanks also participate in the attack, the result for hitting drops to 5; if there are also planes involved it drops to 4.<br/><br/>Players can play some events: Arrival of reinforcements, Additional impulse (which allows you to extend the turn), Arrest battle (allows you to immediately end a battle), partisans, etc. But the event markers are generic, it is the player who must decide where to place them on a special track to trigger that type of event. And he can do it at any time...<br/><br/>-description from designer<br/><br/>",

This is the story of Seth being brave enough to meet his first human, learn how to fish and then use his passion for the sport to teach everyone he meets about how much fun it is to hunt for your own Bassquatch!<br/><br/>Fish On! is a chance to fish in Seth Squatch's world as Seth. You can catch a Largemouth bass, Smallmouth bass, Blue Gill or a Northern Pike when you land on a &quot;FISH ON!&quot; spot.&nbsp;<br/><br/>You could also catch Seaweed (grass bass), Sticks (tree pounder) or get hooked on a stump if you do not pull a fish card or any of the other obstacles mixed into the deck.&nbsp;<br/><br/>You can circle the island and hit all of the best fishing spots until a player decides to cross the finish line and end the game. At this time, each player adds up their fish either by inches or pounds to see who has the largest amount of size or weight in their nets!&nbsp;<br/> This game will help with basic math skills, Fish identification, size expectations and a very fun adventure for kids. The Fish On! game is also a big hit for adults to play against their buddies! The competitive trash talking begins after the first roll of the dice usually. This game operates very similar to a fishing tournament so even if you are a non fisherman, it will be fun, competitive and educational for all!<br/><br/>You never know, your next adventure could lead you to be the next Bassquatch Hunter!<br/><br/>",

The games played on a 12 x 12 square board play out quicker, the gameplay is usually more dynamic, and tense, as the Command Tank's escape is looming from the first few turns, and clashes and first casualties can be expected, basically, from turn 2. You&rsquo;ll want to pay close attention to corridors closing due to vehicle destruction at all times, as you don&rsquo;t want to block your own pieces from preventing a quick escape of the opponent's Command Tank.<br/><br/>The box measures 15.5 x 15.5 x 4 cm, and it contains a double-sided board that measures 29 x 29 cm; both the box and the board are made out of thick cardboard &ndash; the same as the Standard box and boards. Inside, there is the same set of pieces and flags as in the Standard version (2 x 16 pieces), so you can create many completely different custom setups and get an infinitely replayable game out of this single expansion.<br/><br/>",

In general, in games on a board this large, with a lot of pieces, the battle phase is usually divided into more segments, as engagements take place in several areas on the board, and each player tries to shift the focus to the side where he has a better chance of gaining an advantage. The endgame tightly depends on the outcome of the battles, as the player who prevails in complex tactical battles usually has a free path for their Command Tank, or a clear opportunity to surround and destroy the opponent's Command Tank.<br/><br/>The games on the Extended, 24x24 square board games are more demanding in terms of space, and also long-lasting, with more elaborate initial strategies, and a lot of tactical maneuvering and depth. In addition to the pieces from the base game, TC Extended set also contains Super Heavy Tanks, Recon Tanks, Heavy Bulldozers, and Light Howitzers. The set contains these additional tanks in 4 colors, so if you combine the content of TC: Extended with the base game, you will have the possibility to play 4-player games with a full set of pieces.<br/><br/>",

That is why there is a special Airborne (mini) Expansion. It contains a total of 12 pieces (6 in each color): 2x Airborne Light tank; 2x Armed Off-road vehicle (airborne), and 2x Anti-Aircraft tank.<br/><br/>Airborne pieces can, under certain conditions, land on almost any square. The main landing condition is that there are no Anti-Aircraft tank pieces nearby, as they deter planes carrying airborne pieces. This way, the game gets a completely new dimension, and, literally, it is the third dimension, because the players have to keep in mind that the opponent can at any moment drop a piece from the skies and change the outcome of the game. That is why the Anti-Aircraft tank pieces are of particular importance, especially when in vicinity of the Command Tank, defending it. <br/>The brochure for this expansion will feature many obstacle setups (for all board sizes) in which the Airborne pieces play the central role.<br/><br/>",

You must roll the right symbols to enter a room, and if you're at an open doorway, you can roll to reveal the next tile in the stack and add it to that doorway.

In January 1687, Phipps found the wreck of the Spanish galleon Nuestra Se&ntilde;ora de la Concepci&oacute;n off the coast of Santo Domingo. Some sources say they used an inverted container for the salvage operation while others say the crew was assisted by Indian divers in the shallow waters. The operation lasted from February to April 1687 during which time they salvaged jewels, some gold and 30 tons of silver which, at the time, was worth over &pound;200,000.<br/><br/>Diving Bell takes the players on a journey to the bottom of the sea to find various treasures. But it is not a walk in the park to find them - various threats exist to stop the players from doing so. <br/>Diving Bell is a cooperative game that players will use a unique way of choosing actions to get their ships ready for diving. A diving bell is also an option to help with the success of each dive they are used.

        "description": "Lone Sherman puts you in charge of a single Sherman Tank and its crew somewhere in France in World War II, and tasks you with navigating your Sherman through varied and challenging Missions. Whilst this game is not a &lsquo;narrative driven&rsquo; game as such, with a little imagination it will provide memorable stories. The Missions allow the Player to invent any kind of back-story they like in order to enhance the feel of the game. Some events are randomly generated, but the Player always has at least some degree of control over the level of risk they wish to take and how vulnerable they leave their Tank to these Events.<br/><br/>The Fields of Normandy 2 (the sequel to The Fields of Normandy) is set in Normandy, France in 1944 and reflects loosely the conditions and situations faced by the US VIII Corps of the United States Army as it pushed inland as part of Operation Cobra. The fighting was intense and incredibly violent. German units were very well dug in and protected by artillery and mines. In the game, you will be controlling small groups of soldiers from a platoon, consisting of three Rifle Squads, a Machine Gun Team, a Bazooka Team and a Mortar Team. As the platoon Lieutenant, it is your job to command these squads and teams in order to clear the German defensive positions.<br/><br/>The aim of this book is to present two clear, accessible, and quick to learn war games, so that players can get into the action quickly. It does not try to replace more complex wargames which often take many hours to learn and to play. Each of the Missions can be played in around an hour and the game provides plenty of 'replayability'.<br/><br/>This games in this book are solitaire hex and counter style wargame. You play the games, and the enemies are controlled by the game book (or the Artificial Intelligence or &lsquo;AI&rsquo;). You will need to bring at least 5, but preferably 7, standard six-sided dice. Full colour 'Mission Maps' are included. Methods to play the game include:<br/><br/>     Cut out or copy the counters provided on the final page of the book, stick them to card and cut them out with a good quality craft knife or pair of scissors.<br/>     Photocopy the maps and draw/write on the pages lightly in pencil and erase when necessary. You can use any annotations you choose for the units, that make sense to you.<br/>     Lay the book flat (it&rsquo;s well-bound, it can stand it!) and use cubes, miniatures, or similar tokens for the units.<br/>     Use some kind of acetate and dry-wipe markers.<br/><br/><br/>Take a photo of the maps on a tablet and use the &ldquo;edit&rdquo; function to draw and erase.<br/><br/>",

        "description": "Circle of Blood is a cooperative wargame, for two to four players, that uses 32mm miniatures and scaled scenery to recreate the tactical confrontations of one or more groups of adventurers, called guilds. The game also allows to play solo, for those adventurers who prefer to live the Gormalak experience by themselves. Or competitives one.<br/><br/>In Circle of Blood you take command of a guild made up of three adventurers. You can design them to your liking or use the predesigned characters (which we recommend to get started).<br/>Game sequence<br/>The first thing you have to do in order to play is choosing a mission. We recommend playing &quot;New in town,&quot; featured in the complete manual.<br/>Each player sets up their three models within the area specified by the mission. Then, one of the players starts the turn by activating one of their adventurers. Next the other player chooses one of their adventurers and activates it.<br/>NPCs are always the last models to be activated (regardless of whether they are allies or not). Thus, after each guild has activated one adventurer, it&rsquo;s the NPCs turn, who must activate the model that is the closest to an adventurer.<br/>Remember to place an activation marker next to each model once it has been activated so you don't activate it again until the next turn.<br/>This same activation order is repeated over and over again until there are no more models left to be activated, at which point the turn ends and we move on to the next one. Remove all activation markers at that time.<br/><br/>Game system<br/>When activated, each model has a number of Action Points (AP), which is usually 4. Most of their actions (such as moving, jumping, or attacking an enemy) cost it 1 AP, though some may cost more. The model can repeat the same action a number of times equal to half its total AP (usually two). The only action that a model can freely repeat is to move.<br/><br/>Movement (MOV)<br/>For each AP that the model uses to move, it will cover a distance equal to the one indicated in the MOV box of its template. When you move, the model can be facing in any direction you want.<br/><br/>Checks<br/>Many actions are not automatic and require checking certain values from the Adventurer Sheet or creature template. Look up the value in question (which will range from 1 to 20) and roll 1d20. If the result is less than the number indicated on the Adventurer Sheet, the check is a success. If the result is exactly that number, it is a critical success. If the result is greater than the required number, it is a failure. Regardless of the final result of the check and whether it is successful or not, it always consumes the AP required to perform the action.<br/><br/>Penalties<br/>External factors, which we call 'penalties', can negatively affect the course of a test. The sum of all the penalties changes the final value to be obtained in the check.<br/>For example: A 2 penalty on a skill of 12 requires a d20 roll between 3 and 12.<br/><br/>Offensive actions<br/>There are three types of offensive actions (melee, ranged, and magical).<br/><br/>    Melee: This type of attack requires base-to-base contact with the enemy model. The attacker rolls his Combat Skill (CS) and suffers a penalty equal to the opponent's Defense (DEF).<br/>    Ranged: The target of the attack must be within the range of the weapon used. The attacker rolls his Shooting Skill (SS) and suffers various penalties (adjustments for long range, cover, movement, etc.).<br/>    Magical: The target of the spell must be within range. The attacker rolls his Magic Skill (MS) and suffers penalties depending on the difficulty of the spell and the Magic Resistance (MR) of the victim.<br/><br/><br/>When the offensive action succeeds, it will deal an amount of damage indicated on the weapon or spell&rsquo;s description. This is subtracted from the victim's Armor (ARM) and the final result is subtracted from their current Hit Points (HP). When the model loses all of its HP, it will be defeated and must be removed from the game.<br/>Reaction<br/>If a model has not been activated yet, but suffers an offensive action, it has the chance to react. During a reaction, the model has access to only half its normal AP and can only attack the model that caused the reaction.<br/>To determine who acts first, both models make a Dexterity (DEX) check. Whoever rolls the highest on a d20 wins. Alternate the actions of the models involved until they consume all their AP.<br/><br/>NPC Behavior<br/>All the NPCs act according to the objective they must fulfill in the mission (attack, defend, secure an area, etc.). Each objective describes how the model must me moved during the scenario and what actions they will perform.<br/>When another model or game circumstance &ldquo;bothers&rdquo; them (for example, attacking the NPC or making it impossible for them to fulfill their objective), we must consult their personality trait (rational, aggressive, or passive). This will determine their behavior, for example, causing them to run away from the model responsible, ignore it or even attack.<br/><br/>NPC combat<br/>When they decide to fight, NPCs look for the most effective way of attacking based on the attributes of their weapons (CS, SS or MS). They always use the one that allows them to attack the greatest number of times taking into account, for example, if they are in base-to-base contact or further away from their enemy.<br/><br/>These are the most important mechanics in Circle of Blood. Now we invite you to take a look at the final manual to see everything that this narrative action wargame has to offer. Battle dozens of different enemies, gain fame and riches, and discover the sinister secret behind Gormalak!<br/><br/>&mdash;description from the publisher<br/><br/>",

        "description": "From Muskets to Rifles&hellip; is based upon C&rsquo;est la Guerre: Fast Play Wargame for the Age of Muskets. This system was designed to provide a fast yet satisfying game play, not necessarily a &ldquo;realistic&rdquo; simulation of battle recreation. Bases or &lsquo;Units&rsquo; in the game do not represent a certain number of men or artillery pieces but are abstract representations of force.<br/><br/>From Muskets to Rifles&hellip; uses:<br/><br/><br/>     a simple command structure to manage battlefield movement without dealing with morale or having the players issue orders,<br/>     a troop grading system so that better trained more effective troops can have an advantage over poorly trained less effective troops, and<br/>     a method to account for casualties and losses without an overly complicated accounting system.<br/><br/><br/>At the beginning of the 19th Century European armies were mostly armed with smooth bore muzzle loading muskets and bronze smooth bore muzzle loading artillery. These armies fought in dense formations of infantry, and they relied upon the gallant cavalry charging in mass to break enemy lines. Not so very different from the weapons and methods used two hundred years before.<br/><br/>By the end of the 19th Century we see the introduction of machine guns, breach loading and bolt action repeating rifles, metal cartridge ammunition, accurate and powerful rifled artillery, and even the occasional airplane flying through the skies. We also see the mass production and industrialization of warfare that made these new technologies cheap, uniform, and abundant. This period of dynamic change, between the age of the musket and the &lsquo;modern&rsquo; mobile warfare we see today, began at some point after the end of the Napoleonic Wars and came to its culmination during World War I. So that will be how we define the time period of &lsquo;19th Century Warfare&rsquo; &ndash; 1820s to 1910s.<br/><br/>(publisher description)<br/><br/>",

The game also recreates critical supply constraints. A player refighting the Desert Campaign, like his real-life counterparts, cannot fight continuously &ndash; he launches an offensive, pauses to build up supply, then resumes his offensive&hellip;unless his opponent has preempted him and launched his own offensive first. As in real life, offensives tend to run out of gas (literally) as they approach the enemy&rsquo;s home base.<br/><br/>Historical elements include air support, minefields, engineers, artillery, anti-tank guns, Axis fuel shortages, and Allied command and control problems. From Operation Compass to Second Alamein, Desert Generals covers the Desert War from start to finish.<br/><br/>&mdash;description from the designer<br/><br/>",

The two were sent to Earth in order to create a beautiful landscape as an ode of love to Xochanama, the Moon goddess forever fated to be out of Ino'itl's reach.<br/><br/>During the game, players draw and place Elemental Tokens onto a 6x6 game board, jumping opponent pieces and flipping them over. For every opponent token jumped, along with the token placed, the player gains corresponding Elemental Resources. Earth, Water, Life, Void, and Spirit.<br/><br/>Resources are used to gain Creation Cards, which represent the fantastic landscape being crafted by the players. Creation Cards come in five different types: Terra, Aqua, Species, Source, and Wonder. Each card type has its own unique scoring mechanic. Terra Cards score for the player who creates the most expansive landscape. Aqua Cards score based on the difference in value from one card to the next. The more varieties of Species Cards you create, the higher your point value. Source Cards grant the player extra resources, and also score for each corresponding Creation Card crafted. Wonder Cards score points for each token flipped to your side at the end of the game.<br/><br/>In addition to scoring, Creation Cards affect each other through an interconnected ecosystem. You must generate enough Terra to support your Aquatic creations, or else they are discarded at the end of the game. Aqua is needed to keep your Species alive, with each species type requiring different amounts of water. If a Habitat Icon shown on one of your Species cards matches a Habitat on one of your Terra cards, you gain valuable bonus points.<br/><br/>Along the way, players can acquire and use Dragon Powers to try and get a one up on their opponent. These abilities include actions like creating additional cards on your turn, flipping tokens on the board, increasing your hand size, and even discarding an opponent's Creation Card. Players can also spend resources to Flourish their Creation Cards, generating more Aqua, Terra, and victory points. And once per game, each player may summon the aid of the Sun god and Moon goddess to recharge their powers or redraw a new hand of Creation Cards.<br/><br/>The winner of Children of the Sun is the player who crafts the most captivating landscape, pleasing the Moon goddess and securing favor from the Sun god!<br/><br/>&mdash;description from the publisher<br/><br/>",

Players spin tops onto a vibrant, colorful board, each aiming for the top to tumble into one of several holes, each assigned with a different point value. The first to reach a score of 100 is the victor.

        "description": "March of the Wicked Horde is a card game that simulates fantasy battles. The setting is medieval fantasy including factions such as elves and undead. The gameplay is a mixture of chess-like strategy and mechanics similar to trading card games but with no randomness like shuffling or dice.<br/><br/>Players choose a faction and determine who goes first. They then take turns placing land and units, moving units, attacking, activating schemes and using scheme abilities. There is no board but cards are used as tiles and arranged in a grid relative to other cards. The object of the game is to kill the enemy commander.<br/><br/>The elves hail from forested lands, using assassins with acrobatics and bow tactics to consume an enemy's forces. The undead hordes emerge from graveyards and grow faster as they kill the enemy. New factions are planned and each new faction that comes out will increase the number of players for the game by one.<br/><br/>March of the Wicked Horde is all about skill. There are no dice, no shuffling and no face-down cards to draw. The movement may remind you of chess but units can only be attacked when your threat is greater than the enemy's reinforcement. You may need to pick off weakly reinforced enemy units, pose a greater threat by ganging up on a strong enemy unit, or combine schemes in a clever way. Any two games are very unlikely to go exactly the same way as there are many possible actions on each turn and many layered strategies to experiment with.<br/><br/>&mdash;description from the designer<br/><br/>",

        "description": "Over time, a large number of smaller table games developed from classic billiards, all of which have remained true to the successful basic principle of sinking the ball. The Spirobille also comes from the sphere of billiard-like games, a variation that is as unusual as it is fascinating and whose game principle is extremely simple. A steel ball is brought into play via the center piece and rolls down the sloping field towards one of the players. He should remove the ball from his goal as soon as possible using the flipper lever and, if possible, hammer one of the teammates into the goal. This borrowing from the pinball game that emerged in the early 1950s gave it its current speed. (In its predecessor, the Jeu de Marteau, you still had to maneuver the balls in the direction of the opponent's goals with small clubs.) Spirobille is best played with four players, but it's just as much fun - the vacant goals are then blocked by insertable steel brackets lockable &ndash; for two or three people. The Spirobille, which is made entirely in Switzerland, is part of the standard range of so-called toy libraries there &ndash; a kind of libraries for games &ndash; in which it has to withstand all the requirements of lending. It is accordingly solidly manufactured and lasts far beyond the total exhaustion of the players.<br/><br/>",

        "description": "August 1863. Preparations begin for the Salon, the largest and most prestigious art exhibition in the world! The Louvre halls will be filled with paintings from floor to ceiling, and you will be one of those responsible for selecting the works.<br/>The task is not easy: hundreds of works have been entered, and you will need to choose the best ones for the room you are curating.<br/><br/>To be successful, it is fundamental to identify which themes are most in vogue this year and to reject the very modern paintings, which have no place in a classic Fine Arts salon, but which may dictate the new directions of art in the future.<br/><br/>In Salon, players bid on paintings with different styles and formats and then place them on their player boards according to the highlight they want to give the selected painting. Paintings not chosen are sent to the Hall of Rejects and may give bonuses to the player who places them there.<br/><br/>Throughout the game, players try to get medals for their paintings, make the themes of their interest more valuable and prepare for the next auctions.<br/><br/>The player with the most victory points at the end of the game will be considered the best art curator in the Salon de Paris.<br/><br/>",

The player with the most points at the end emerges as the winner.<br/><br/>Each player is dealt a hand of cards, and the objective is to form completed sets by either having two cards with the same picture or by connecting pictures. When a player completes a set, they earn a point.<br/><br/>To determine the dealer, a game of rock, paper, scissors is played, and the next player in line draws a card from the dealer's hand. The player who draws the card checks if any pictures line up in their hand, and if they have a completed set, they place the cards in front of them. Then, the next player draws a card from the first player's hand, and this process continues in order.<br/><br/>Players take turns drawing cards and checking for completed sets until everyone's hands are empty. At the end of the game, the player with the most points wins.<br/><br/>Additionally, the game introduces a special card called the &quot;Toilet Card.&quot; If a player has two Toilet Cards, they can select a collection of another player's cards, known as a &quot;poo collection,&quot; and &quot;flush&quot; it away. The flushed poo and toilet cards are placed together on the side. The Toilet Cards can be used at any time, but if a player holds onto them, another player might take them. Collecting all four types of Toilet Cards grants a bonus of four points.<br/><br/>",

Players aim to accumulate the most prizes and coins to achieve different titles at the end of the game.<br/><br/>To set up the game, the cards are folded and placed on the game board along with a prize. Each player starts with three coin cards. The Chief Officer, Crane Player, and remaining players are assigned their roles.<br/><br/>During gameplay, the Chief Officer gives one of their coin cards to the Crane Player, who acts as the crane operator. The Crane Player uses their hand, mimicking a crane arm, to try and grab prizes from the game board. The Chief Officer verbally guides the Crane Player on the movement of the crane arm.<br/><br/>The Crane Player closes their eyes and moves the crane arm based on the Chief Officer's instructions. The Chief Officer can give instructions to move right, go forward, and drop a prize. The Crane Player tries to grab the prize using their thumb and index finger. If successful, they must rely on intuition to return the prize to the game box without opening their eyes.<br/><br/>If the Crane Player successfully returns the prize to the game box, the Chief Officer receives the prize. However, if the Crane Player fails to grab the prize or drops it midway, their team's turn is over. The game continues with each player taking turns as the Chief Officer and the Crane Player moving to the left.<br/><br/>After everyone has completed a round as the Chief Officer, the second round begins with new assignments. After each player has had three turns as the Chief Officer, the game ends. The player with the highest number of special prizes becomes the &quot;Best Player,&quot; while the player with the most coins becomes the &quot;Best Crane Player.&quot; The player with the most prizes and coins earns the title of &quot;Crane Master.&quot;<br/><br/>",

        "description": "Dish of Spurs (DoS) is a set of miniature rules for skirmish actions during the Border Reivers period.<br/><br/>In DoS players lead bands of raiders or the forces out to stop them. Each unit gets two actions per turn with which they may move, shoot, herd cattle, break down doors, etc. Captains confer bonus actions on their troops and heroes inspire their fellows to greater bravery.<br/><br/>Actions generally require a die roll to succeed, and all dice are normal d6. To shoot for example, you must roll higher than your shoot score. To rally, you must roll higher than your morale.<br/><br/>The game is scenario driven, with victory varying according to circumstance. A raider may win by getting a certain number of cattle off the board, the local marshal wins by preventing them. Or perhaps two clans fight over a wedding, one seeking to prevent the union, the other to see it carried through.<br/><br/>The game includes an optional hidden movement rule which while slowing play adds a lot of nuance to the tactics of each side.<br/><br/>-description from designer<br/><br/>",

        "description": "Manafolds is a fantasy-themed trick-taking/area control game. You lead a faction that is aligned primarily with one of six manafold types. Manafolds, also called &ldquo;folds&quot;, are magical locations, each with unique characteristics. You seek to deepen your knowledge of the folds, channeling energies from them to best your rivals and gain the most Prestige.<br/> You win a game of Manafolds by having the most Prestige after three Ages or being the first player to reach 20 Prestige, whichever comes first. The majority of Prestige points that you can earn come from securing Titles. Titles can be granted through ruling manafolds, fulfilling card-based objectives, and other unique goals.<br/><br/>Each Age consists of four Encounters, preceded by a bidding session to determine the player who will lead the Age&rsquo;s first Encounter and dictate which fold is exalted (i.e. the &ldquo;trump&rdquo; suit). Exalting a manafold suit grants you the privilege of setting the Titles that provide Prestige points, and the exalter must make their bid in points from these Titles in order to avoid losing any Prestige.<br/><br/>At the start of each Encounter, the lead player will take a turn, which involves playing an Encounter Card from their hand and taking some actions. Some of these actions for example will let you move your units between manafolds, deploy more units, attack other factions, and increase your chances of winning encounters. In turn order, each other player will similarly take some actions and play an Encounter Card, following suit if able. After all players go, the winner is determined, which is the player whose played card is in the lead suit with the highest power, unless bested by an exalted-suit card. The winner chooses an Encounter Effect (a boon from any one of the played cards), claims all played cards, and leads the next encounter. After all encounters have been resolved for a given Age, Prestige is awarded, followed by a transition to the next Age. <br/> As the game arcs, players will be deepening their skill and understanding of the folds (making corresponding actions stronger), gaining more mana discs to be able to take more actions during their turns, and acquiring powerful Relics, further enhancing their own unique action tableaus. Will your faction be immortalized through the tales of the people, or will you be forsaken? Only time will tell&hellip;<br/><br/>-description from designer<br/><br/>",

The Fronde had many facets. This game focusses on high politics and intrigue, involving four key factions: the Mazarinists, who aim to preserve the status quo and save the state from bankruptcy; the Cabalists (les Cabale des Importantes), a group of high aristocrats who want Mazarin gone and their own power augmented; the Retzists (pronounced &lsquo;reyists&rsquo;) under Coadjutor Retz, who also want Mazarin gone so that Retz can take his job; the Cond&eacute;eans, following the Great Cond&eacute;, who aims to turn himself into a new &lsquo;Mayor of the Palace&rsquo;. Apart from these selfish aims, each side sees itself as defenders of the King, the young Louis XIV. There is no thought of supplanting him, but all want to be in the most advantageous position when he reaches his majority. Meanwhile, the lower classes groan under high taxation and shortages. They demand an end to the ceaseless war with Spain. Or else.<br/><br/>You will play one (or more, if the player count is less than 4) of the four factions, seeking both political and military influence among your peers. Will you champion the cause of the common folk (whether honestly or cynically) to exert leverage on the Crown, form networks among the noble houses to oppose the will of your rivals, or rely on the Army to crush all opposition?<br/><br/>The game uses the same mechanics as RSG&rsquo;s popular Parcel o&rsquo; Rogues. Action cards allow you to place and remove cubes of your colour from a board representing the connections between those people, places, and institutions who were relevant to the Fronde. Having Influence (your cubes) in a location allows you to score it; locations score for both their political and military value. Special Season cards advance the turn marker and trigger various events. Rules unique to this game include the arrest of certain individuals, military campaigns on the frontiers, the ability to make a Royal Progress, Spanish Gold, Mazarin&lsquo;s cunning use of voluntary exile to confuse his opponents, and the presence of the resourceful d&rsquo;Artagnan and the Three Musketeers!<br/><br/>&mdash;description from the publisher<br/><br/>",

        "description": "Witch Night is a party game for witches. Players roll and move forward on a track. Each field they land on marks a category for which they draw a card. The cards tell them to answer a question or perform a creative or silly task within one minute. If successful, they can proceed to roll again.<br/>A witch that reaches the central field will have to draw a card from each of the six categories. If they can fulfill at least four of the six tasks, they win the game.<br/>Each witch also holds two special cards, a positive and a negative one. These can be used once in a game. The positive card gains you an advantage, the negative card can be used as an obstacle to another witch.<br/><br/>",

They didn&rsquo;t care about confession nor country borders. They only followed the sound of drums and fought for whoever paid the most.<br/><br/>You lead one of five factions that played an important role in Central Europe: England, France, Habsburg Spain, the Papacy and the Italian City States in its vicinity or The German Holy Roman Empire.<br/><br/>To win the game you need to control a certain number of regions and need to maintain or convert a certain number of centers to the confession of your faction. Victory conditions for each faction are different and as some factions aim for a certain confession in the centers, they help their opponents fulfilling their victory conditions. In addition to that the English player may win the game if the continent is overrun by the troops of the Ottoman Empire.<br/><br/>To achieve your goal of the game you send out at the beginning of a turn members of your court to various centers in Europe where they fulfill tasks in your name. Your diplomats, your generals, admirals and spies. These will affect the possibilities of your actions in the regions of Europe. Your merchants will try to ensure your share of the market potential in a region, your bishops will try to convert a Center&rsquo;s confession.<br/><br/>A turn starts by each player increasing their treasury. For each &ldquo;Barrel&rdquo; on the map players increase their income by 1. Players may then recruit new armies, build new fleets and most importantly instruct members of their court. Players buy new &ldquo;Barrels&rdquo; that they plan to place on the map.<br/> After increasing their treasury, building new units, players send on journey their &ldquo;Members&rdquo;. The starting player first places one of his Members with its identity face down in one of the Centers on the game map. The following player does the same. If he wishes to place his Member in the same Center, he places his Member on top of the player before him. One after another the players place their Members one by one. They build stacks of Members in the Centers of Europe. When all Members are placed, their identity is revealed one by one, from top to bottom, and they execute their possible actions. Members allow players to move units, take a share of a market in a region, lay siege on Centers, fight battles, try to convert the confession of a Center, explore the New World and so on.<br/><br/>If a player fulfilled his victory conditions at the end of a turn he reveals his Victory Card and is declared the winner.<br/><br/>-description from designer<br/><br/>",

One of its goals is to keep the market thriving, and for that, goods from all over the country need to circulate more easily and in larger quantities.<br/><br/>Thus, a plan was created for the development of railway lines in Brazil, with the objective of connecting the new railway routes with the existing ones, as well as utilizing well-functioning river routes.<br/><br/>The plan sparked interest from many companies, which led to significant investment and internal and external interferences. However, despite being one of the boldest plans that could theoretically improve freight transportation in the country, it fell into disuse. 1890: National Railways Plan is a game that brings to the table the experience of this plan, applied over three decades.<br/><br/>In this game that blends elements of 18xx with euro games, we are investors buying and selling shares of companies interested in investing in Brazil's railway lines. The stock market is constantly changing as it reacts to players' interactions with the market itself, as well as the development or lack thereof, of the companies.<br/><br/>These companies, in turn, will buy trains, construct routes, collect revenues, and pay dividends to investors or not. Such crucial decisions will be made by their respective presidents, meaning the player who holds the highest percentage of the company in question.<br/><br/>The winner will be the one who can best manage the companies and manipulate the stock market, as the individual with the most money and the highest-value portfolio will be the victor of 1890.<br/><br/>",

The key concept within the rules is to assume that obvious things are happening i.e. there is no 'musketry' sub-system, it is just assumed that if a unit is in effective range, it is firing.  There are some optional rules for including command and control issues, and a few optional rules for specific conflicts.<br/><br/>",

The catch is that the opponent to your right decides which of 16 path tiles you must use for your next movement.<br/><br/>Each player has 2 pawns and 16 path tiles. Each of the 16 paths are unique. Your path tiles are given to the player to your right. Players each chose a side on the lower level, and place their pawns freely outside of the corners.<br/><br/>You opponent chooses which path you have to use. You can rotate the path any way you like, giving you up to 8 different moves per pawn for assymetrical paths. After use, the path tile is discarded. You can't move through other pawns, nor outside the board, and if you can't move at all, your opponent takes one of your pawns and moves it to the lowest level. This move is called a Traxit, which is latin for being pulled.<br/><br/>Scoring<br/>At the end of every 4 rounds (4, 8, 12 and 16) you score points for the position of your pawns (0, 25, 50 or 100) depending on how close to the top they are.<br/><br/>Bonus<br/>A 50 point bonus is added for getting both your pawns to the top at any time.<br/><br/>Variants<br/>There is also a short version of the game, where you only play 12 of the 16 path tiles, and a team variant where you team up with the player opposite you, to play against the players to your sides.<br/><br/>",

Players then flip a clock piece; if the color and time match one of their time-slot pieces, they cover it with the clock piece. Otherwise, both the clock and Disney pieces are flipped back over.<br/><br/>The game continues with players trying to remember the placement and colors of the pieces on the table. The winner is the first player to cover all of their time-slot pieces with matching clock pieces. A delightful way to learn about time, this game is suitable for children aged 5 and up.<br/><br/>",

A gentleman's card and a lady's card always make a pair, one suitable or one unsuitable! This can be argued about and there will also be disputes, which, if necessary, will ultimately be decided by the selected game master.<br/>Whoever has a matching pair reads out the two texts and asks for recognition so that they can discard the pair.<br/>When all cards have been taken from the table, you draw from your right neighbor. At the end, a lady card and the maiden room remain in one hand. That costs a deposit.<br/>The player to arrange the most auspicious marriages receives the award and is the winner.<br/><br/>The game is from about 1925.<br/><br/>&mdash;user summary<br/><br/>",

        "description": "You are the most powerful of ancient magicians and shapeshifters, but for a thousand years you have waited, sealed inside a meagre brass lantern, lost under the sands of time. A group of ardent archeologists have now uncovered your magical prison, and want to use your powers to grant them power and riches beyond belief. Polishing your lantern they have awakened not only your slumbering spirit, but your powerful cleverness and guile. Will you be able to grant these foolish mortals their hearts desires while outplaying them at their own game? Success for you means freedom from endless years of servitude and a return to earthly pleasures. Or is your fate sealed, like the burnished brass lantern which has been your solitary cell for centuries?<br/><br/>Djinn Rummy is a card game based on classic rummy depicting the battle of wits between a Genie and mortals. Mortals attempt to lay down runs and sets to score points and empty their hands of cards. The Genie plays differently, by playing a run from 1 to 10 (symbolizing the thousand years they have spent imprisoned), trying to empty their hand first. However, the Genie may take cards played by mortals by granting them &quot;wishes&quot; that possibly increase their chances to score and to win. If the Genie wins, they score alone; if any mortal wins, they score alone; but if a Genie grants three wishes to any mortal, that mortal and the Genie score, excluding all other mortals. At the end of each round, the Genie appoints a mortal as the new Genie to hinder their chances of winning.<br/><br/>&mdash;description from the publisher<br/><br/>",

Claim victory by being the first to control 15 tiles!<br/><br/>Each player has identical deck of 15 glyph tiles and 15 matching crystals.  You play with your hand of 3 tiles face up.<br/><br/>There are 3 phases to each turn; reveal, play, discard.<br/>On their turn, players reveal by flipping over 2 additional tiles in to their hand so that they have five face up tiles.  The player then selects a tile to play adjacent to one or more tiles potentially gaining control of them.  The player places their crystal on the newly played tile and additionally replaces any opponent&rsquo;s crystal with one of their own on any captured tile(s).  Their turn ends by selecting one of their 4 remaining face up tiles to be placed face up in to a discard pile.  Play continues clockwise with the next player repeating these steps.<br/><br/>&mdash;description from the designer<br/><br/>",

While there is a common goal of defeating a single raid boss, each player's real goal is to land the &quot;final blow&quot; and claim all the rewards.<br/><br/>On each player's turn, they draw 2 cards from the character deck. After checking both cards, he or she places one card underneath the boss card without revealing it, and the other card to one side with the boss card revealed. The area under the boss card is called the party recruitment zone, and the area where the remaining card is placed is called the party waiting zone.<br/><br/>Character cards are divided into normal and special classes, with special classes being treated as two normal classes and should be left uncovered when placed in the Party Recruit Zone. However, depending on the boss card's abilities, you may need to keep special class cards covered as well.<br/><br/>On the other hand, instead of drawing cards when it's their turn, players can also keep the cards in the Party Recruit Zone to themselves and decide whether to keep them in the Party Recruit Zone or send them to the Party Waiting Zone. This can be used to confirm that your own calculations are correct, but it can also be used to disrupt your opponent's calculations.<br/><br/>If you think you can defeat the boss with the character cards in the Party Recruitment Zone on your turn, declare &quot;Defeat&quot;. At this point, all cards in the Party Recruitment Zone are revealed. The boss card describes the boss's power, how much power each class brings to the party, and the boss's effects.<br/><br/>The game ends when one player captures the boss, when all other players are eliminated and only one player remains, or when the character deck is exhausted. If a player successfully captures the boss, award that player 2 victory tokens, and if only one player remains, award that player 1 victory token. If the deck is exhausted, no one gets any victory tokens.<br/><br/>The round is then repeated, and the player with the most victory tokens (3 or more) wins.<br/><br/>",

If you can catch up with a fellow player, he has to return to Bern and pay the snatcher 5 points. If there are only 10 buttons left on the playing field, you can fly, i. H. the sections between two city circles are now considered sections. Whoever has the most points at the end of the game wins. Not only the tokens count as points, but also the buttons and information boards that you have scooped up.<br/><br/>2. Lay routes<br/>Distribute the buttons evenly among the players! Each player places them face up in front of them! The first player places a port location. If he owns subsequent locations, he may move on. Once he has occupied a node, he can set the new direction of travel, provided he has an adjoining location. If he cannot continue, it is the next player's turn. If you reach an end point or a line that is already occupied, you can start a new one following an already occupied line. The first person to lay out their buttons wins.<br/><br/>3. Zigzag<br/>Place all buttons, except fives, face down on any location! The first player draws a button and goes to the location printed on it. If this is occupied, he keeps the first button and continues in the same way with the new one. But if he comes to an uncovered place, the following player may continue. In the first round you can take a maximum of 5 buttons! Whoever buys the most buttons wins.<br/><br/>&mdash;user summary<br/><br/>",

The winner is the player who finds the most nuts and avoids finding the trash.<br/><br/>The game is played in two stages - groundwork and discovery &hellip; or rediscovery more like.   During the first stage you will take turns placing tiles until all tiles in play are placed. Each player can see their own tiles, but not the opponents.<br/><br/>Note: Every new tile must touch a previous one to form one picture.  Keep in mind that you are trying not only to remember where you place your nuts, but also to confuse your opponents and make sure they don&rsquo;t find all of theirs.<br/><br/>When all the tiles are laid out and you have a nice picture of a forest floor, it&rsquo;s time to go Nuts!<br/><br/>Second stage: All players take turns picking a tile and flipping it until every player has flipped exactly 10<br/>tiles and placed them in front of them. The aim is of course to pick the tiles that have your nuts underneath. There are 10 nuts in every set and as you get exactly 10 tries, there is<br/>no room for mistakes.<br/><br/>When all players have picked their 10 tiles, it&rsquo;s time to score.   The player who scored highest, wins the game.<br/><br/>",

        "description": "Tricks of the Trade adds a unique twist to the classic concept of a Trick taking game through negotiation and trading. True to its name, players negotiate and exchange cards with each other to try to find an advantage before the Tricks Phase of the game. The unique Tech Deck game effects on cards give players different asymmetric 1-time use abilities through the game making every game fresh and exciting.<br/><br/>OBJECTIVE &ndash; The objective of the Tricks of the Trade is to score points. Players score points by bidding accurately, winning tricks, and winning tricks containing cards matching the domain (suit) of their goal card. Skillful negotiation and trading helps players score by improving their odds to win tricks or take tricks with cards matching their goal cards.<br/>GAME PLAY &ndash; In each round, players get to trade with each other. Then, they bid on how many tricks they think they will win. Players get to use a Game Effect from a card in their hand. They play 6 rounds of trick-taking and then determine scores based on tricks won.<br/>GAME END AND WINNING &ndash; Tricks of the Trade ends after three rounds of play.<br/>THEME &ndash; Trick Taking Variant Game<br/><br/>&mdash;description from the designer<br/><br/>",

Said animal has a series of preparations they need to complete before the aforementioned Summer fair arrives.<br/><br/>The game is played without a die, with players being able to move anywhere from one to five squares every turn. As they move, players draw item cards(representing items they found on the forest floor) and encounter obstacles.<br/><br/>Obstacles are cards that are drawn once a player's pawn steps on designated squares. These cards will have requirements on them. The most common way to overcome an obstacle is by discarding a certain amount of common items (as specified on the card). Players are encouraged to make up explanations for how they would use the items to overcome the obstacle (i.e: I use the pen as a pole vault to jump over the fallen tree).<br/><br/>Each character has special abilities that act as boosts for movement, storage space... or as hindrances to the other characters. First one to finish their quests and return home wins. The Summer fair has arrived.<br/><br/>&mdash;description from the designer<br/><br/>",

Diagonal adjacencies are irrelevant in Cataclysm. Blue must form a path of blue checkers connecting the two blue sides of the board.<br/><br/>PLACEMENT You can place a checker on any unoccupied square.<br/><br/>CROSSCUT A crosscut is a group of four adjacent checkers arranged in a square. Two of the checkers in a crosscut are red and two are blue. Like-colored checkers are diagonally opposed.<br/><br/>CATACLYSM Whenever you form a crosscut, you form a bicolored group containing two or more red checkers and two or more blue checkers.

When Yohei's younger brother also turns up dead, it's obviously a murder plot. But who's behind it? Could it be Yohei's widowed daughter? Or maybe it's his illegitimate daughter, kept hidden in the mansion? There's also the gardener he hired to do his dirty work. The murderer could be his grandson, secretly in love with a maid, or maybe it's another maid jealous of their affair? And just who is the mysterious child wearing the fox mask, known only as Forget-Me-Not?<br/><br/>The card game 探偵無宿2 椚の杜に潜む悪魔 (Unregistered Detective 2: The Devil Lurks in Kunugi Forest) is a remake, not a sequel, to Unregistered Detective. It's inspired by classic Japanese murder mysteries, especially those written by Edogawa Ranpo, but this is not a deduction game. It's an atmospheric game where players take on the roles of detectives, each with their own special ability, who try to influence the story to gain the most victory points.<br/><br/>Each round begins with 3 Character Cards, drawn from the Investigation Deck and placed in an Investigation Lineup. As the round progresses, players draw Character Cards and add them to the Lineup. When a character is drawn, they trigger different actions. The cards in the Lineup also represent resources, which players use to play Event Cards, representing significant events in the case. Some Event Cards require a certain number of character deaths or even the deaths of specific characters. Event Cards grant victory points, resources only available to that player, and helpful actions. When a player draws the Night of Tragedy card, the round ends. If a character has more of their Character Cards in the Lineup than anyone else, they are murdered and no longer active in the game. In the event of a tie, no one dies unless 5 Curse Tokens have built up.<br/><br/>The game begins with only 1 of each character in the deck and 1 Curse Token in the play area, so it's unlikely someone will die in the first round. But additional cards and Curse Tokens are added each round, so further deaths are inevitable. Players play increasingly significant Event Cards, crafting a different version of the story each game. Once a player accumulates 10 victory points or five characters have died, the game ends and the winning detective is decided.<br/><br/>",

Whether they kill the Human God or not, players will have to turn on each other to save themselves from death using the cards they have.<br/><br/>&mdash;description from the designer<br/><br/>",

Your mission assignment is to enter underground Viet Cong tunnel complexes in the Cu Chi province and seek out and destroy any VC you may encounter. You will also attempt locate VC work shops and store rooms for the Combat Engineers to later destroy with C-4 explosives. And finally, the discovery of any VC documents in command post rooms is always an added bonus.<br/><br/>With most of the rules integrated into the tables, there is practically no learning curve or rules memorization. And with numerous Tunnel Rat skills, weapons, mission types, possible tactics, random events, a multitude of table modifiers, and a randomized mapping system, Tunnel Rats offers high replay value.

Each player starts with a Castle and a hand of cards, aiming for one of three paths to victory: building a powerful Kingdom, forging strategic Alliances, or reaching a Kingdom value of 300.<br/><br/>The game revolves around the Flop, where three cards are revealed from the Draw deck, forming the initial battlefield. Players take turns drawing, burning unwanted cards, and buying from the Flop to strengthen their armies.<br/><br/>Constructing a Kingdom involves placing Kingdom cards around the Castle, creating Towers that must be conquered in descending order. The player who completes the final Princess Tower wins. Building a 300-value Kingdom also secures victory.<br/><br/>Strategic alliances play a vital role, allowing players to attack and subjugate rival Castles, creating Allied Kingdoms. Allies provide blind cards, bolstering the ruler's power.<br/><br/>Battles ensue as players form Troop Hands with a sum of up to 21. Epic 21 combinations, achieved through Hero cards, offer a potent advantage. The Final Showdown determines the winner, as players battle relentlessly, seeking to conquer rival Towers.<br/><br/>Epic Shogun's blend of strategy, diplomacy, and tactical decision-making makes it a thrilling and engaging card game. Embrace alliances, plot your path to victory, and rise as the supreme ruler of feudal Japan in this epic saga of conquest and triumph.<br/><br/>&mdash;description from the designer<br/><br/>",

They may manipulate the evolution of species by accumulating the length of limbs, either lengthening or shortening. And players may help those animals to survive the catastrophic event by observation and research. The level of the game can be adjusted by the age of players and the circumstances, which makes it suitable for family, friends and class uses.<br/><br/>",

        "description": "Task Force Ranger (TFR) is a Solo or Multi-player &ldquo;team&rdquo; level rule set for up to five players.  It has been designed to simulate combat operations in the middle east from Somalia during Operation Restore Hope (1992-1994),  to Afghanistan 2022.  Enemy forces are Automa (automatically card driven) units.   Campaign play with the included campaign system and Tournament play usually consists of  two to four players on the same game table.  A fifth player may run any special ops teams and helicopters (helos) or play the Leader of the Enemy Forces!<br/><br/>CONCEPT OF PLAY<br/><br/>Task Force Ranger (TFR) is an immersive card driven game. Cards provide you with the majority of the team and equipment information needed to play. The easy to reference rule book walks you through the rules in detail. To begin play, you choose a mission. Your Ranger Chalk is then inserted by land, sea or air and moves out to accomplish it. That mission, like a Snatch &amp; Grab (capture an enemy figure), will enable you to gain victory points (VPs) if you choose keep your teammates in a campaign. Otherwise, just being able to accomplish your mission with good team decisions and a low causality count will be your reward.<br/><br/>During game play each of your chalk teams takes two actions.  After each team completes their actions, draw an enemy activity card.   As you play, these cards add situational flavor.  Add up their different point values.  A total of five causes an enemy attack card to be drawn.  These cards allow enemy teams to enter play.  Who will engage first?  Will you make it to your objective?  Will you complete your mission?  From solo to larger games you will be challenged!  At tournament level, chalks may operate together on the same mission!  &ldquo;Blackhawk Down&rdquo; could be that mission!<br/><br/>A CAMPAIGN SYSTEM WITH 6 SCENARIOS<br/>Including Blackhawk Down, Somalia  <br/>&amp;  Roberts Ridge, Afghanistan!  <br/>Can your rangers accomplish their mission against the Muj in Fallujah? <br/>Will your troops survive outside the wire in the Sandbox?<br/><br/>&mdash;description from the publisher<br/><br/>",

        "description": "The Republic's Struggle is a thematic game with card engine for 2 players, set during the historical events that took place in Spain after the resignation to the throne of King Alfonso XIII, and the proclamation of the II Spanish Republic, in 1931. With the creation of the new regime, the struggle for power between the different social, political and ideological sectors increased, which gave rise to continuous changes of political power, alterations of the public order, armed uprisings and violent acts, carried out by the numerous ideological factions of the moment; which culminated in 1936, in a failed military uprising. The failure of this coup d'&eacute;tat originated the Spanish Civil War.<br/><br/>The game represents all the events of this turbulent period in the history of Spain, which led to a bloody civil war and the destiny of the nation. Spain was not isolated from the rest of the world and especially from the old Europe, so it was a victim of the tensions of the so-called interwar period. During the development of a game, one player on the Republican side, and another on the National side, will be able to recreate events of the period to increase their popularity in the localities by carrying out political propaganda, recruiting troops or militias, generating revolts or assaults, establishing diplomatic relations or carrying out bloody bombardments. All this will be done by playing their hand of cards in an alternative way, either by increasing the events or by playing the action points or icons to perform any of the other actions available to the players.<br/><br/>But both factions will not only seek to control the country, but will also look abroad through diplomatic relations for international support. In the interior, localities of great importance are the localities of barracks, air bases and naval bases. Their control will give important advantages to the player faction for the control of the different fronts. But although Republic Struggle may be inspired by the famous Twilight Struggle, it is not a copy of this game but has its own independent spirit and enough differences and adaptations to the conflict it represents to make it an essential piece that cannot be missing in your toy library. The role of armies and armed roadblocks that can prevent political propaganda from spreading makes it all very interesting. In addition, armies can move from one front to another and defeating enemy armies will help you take control of certain regions even if the politically full people support your rival. And don't forget that it is possible to bombard your opponent.<br/><br/>&mdash;description from the publisher<br/><br/>",

        "description": "Moon Trek is based on the Kariuchi design. The rules are almost the same as the basic Kariuchi.<br/><br/>Changes to the rules were created to make it for 4-player or group competitions. The changes are as follows.<br/><br/>Players can play individually with 2, 3 or 4 players, or in groups of 2-2, 2-1, 2-1-1, 3-1, etc.<br/>Group pieces can be stacked. There is no limit to the number of pieces that can be stacked. Therefore, players cannot remove their own group pieces from the board and returned to the reserve.<br/>If a player's own piece stops at an enemy piece already on the board, the enemy piece is removed from the board and returned to the enemy's reserve position. If multiple pieces are stacked on the space, all the pieces are returned to their respective reserve positions.<br/>If an enemy piece on the circle is removed, the &quot;Kari&quot; die can be cast again. However, if the throw was a roll of 4 or 5, the throw is not repeated twice. Also, if an enemy piece is removed during a short-cut move in the circle, it cannot be re-thrown.<br/><br/>&mdash;description from the publisher<br/><br/>",

        "description": "Defeat the Threat! THE FIRST GUNSHIP is a SOLITAIRE wargame of operational and tactical command.  At the game's core is a patent pending Threat Assembly that simulates an attack by a mysterious alien Threat, making this a truly SOLITAIRE game-playing experience.  The Threat Assembly is tied to varying Intelligence Reports and can be adjusted to varying difficulty levels.  The player commands the maneuver of aircraft, armor, and infantry divisions to repel the Threat attack on the ground and to clear the launch of the First Gunship to move global defense to the next strategic phase.<br/><br/>During each round of play, the player as the Ground Forces Commander orders divisions to maneuver and engage Threat Elements that deploy throughout the game, which represents an operational campaign of 22 months, based on the Threat Assembly.  A Reference Card summarizes all major features of play for quick reference.  The player must achieve the game's objectives, which include successfully defending certain city regions and clearing certain regions of Threat Elements so that the strategic breakthrough of the launch of the First Gunship is achieved.<br/><br/>The game usually lasts 8-9 rounds.  In each round, the Threat deploys based on using the patent pending Threat Assembly.  The player then collects income and purchases new units for deployment at the end of the round.  The player then moves units and conducts Offensive Combat.  The Threat then moves based on the game board configuration, after which Defensive Combat is conducted.  Each round ends with new unit deployment.<br/><br/>The patent pending Threat Assembly is designed to deploy the Threat based on various Intelligence Summary reports that are provided to the player.  The player can thereby control units with advance knowledge of at least some of the Threat's expected movements.  However, the patent pending Threat Assembly also varies the deployment of the Threat so that there is always an element of surprise that varies with each game.  That is, the Threat deployment always varies significantly between games, although the Threat attack proceeds generally based on the provided Intelligence Reports that may change between games.<br/><br/>description from publisher<br/><br/>",

But the journey is full of dangers and mysteries. You must use your wits, skills and luck to overcome the challenges and obstacles that await you.<br/><br/>The game is played with a deck of 100 cards, each featuring a Jump number, a Challenge number, location flavor text and an event. Card number 1 is placed face up in the play area, and the rest of the cards are shuffled and divided into two piles. You choose one pile as your playing deck (the other pile is not used this game).<br/><br/>You also choose a character card and place it in front of you. Each character has four statistics: Health, Reputation, Energy and Intelligence. You have 6 character points to distribute among these statistics as you wish.<br/><br/>On your turn, you draw the top card from the playing deck and place it next to the previous card in the play area. You must guess whether the Jump number on the new card is higher or lower than the Jump number on the previous card. If you guess correctly, you follow the event on the new card. If you guess wrong, you lose 1 Health and must face the Challenge on the new card. To pass the Challenge, you must roll 2 dice and add the value of one of your statistics to your (gold) dice and add the challenge number to the event (white die). If the result is higher than the Challenge number, you succeed. If not, you lose 1 health.<br/><br/>The game ends when one of the following happens:<br/><br/>You find the Home card in the playing deck. You win!<br/>You run out of Health.

The lap markers are put in the center of the board where indicated. Each player then throws the dice. The one with the highest throw puts his car in starting position on the inside lane (lane nearest pit). The player with the next high number puts his car in the next lane, etc., until all cars are in position at the starting line.<br/>First player again throws the dice and moves his car the number of spaces indicated. Each time a player completes a lap, he takes one of his colored markers from the board. Players may, if they wish, move their cars from one lane to another; however, a move to another lane must be made from adjacent squares of the same color. For instance, a player may move his car from a red square in his lane to an adjacent red square in the next lane.<br/>When a player's car stops on one of the spaces indicating mishaps, he must do what the space instructs immediately. <br/>One car may not pass another car in the same line. All passing must be done by changing lanes as explained above. If a player throws a number that allows him to move his car past a car ahead, but it is impossible to do so by changing lanes, the cars are said to collide; they are out of the race. <br/>A lap is completed only when a car has crossed the finish line; then a player may take one of his lap markers from the board, indicating he has completed a lap.

With rippling muscles and a thick scaled hide, the Trun are the ultimate hunters in the galaxy, using brutal weapons and wearing heavy armor plating. They seek out deadly prey to test their skills, living and fighting in tribes of armored warriors.<br/><br/>Sometimes, when a member of a Trun hunting pack becomes disgraced or fails in a critical hunt, they are banished from the tribe, an outcast to their people. These warriors often seek out a glorious death in combat or travel great distances to stalk the deadliest prey alive. But some... some choose to take on a new life. A life of adventure...danger...the life of a Hero! Or maybe just a mercenary. If the pay is high and the chance of glorious death is higher, a Trun Outcast can rarely say no.<br/><br/>This new Hero Pack lets players take on the role of a Trun Outcast; an alien brute from another world, able to pick up and throw smaller Enemies around, smash through combat with a meaty fist, and blast his way through the toughest opponents using his alien weapons and martial prowess.  He can even learn from his prey, getting better at hunting and fighting them over time, developing new tactics and techniques to bring ruin on his enemies! The Trun are not subtle... but when you play a Trun, you're not really looking for subtle. You're looking for a battle monster that can get the job done, or die gloriously trying in an epic way!<br/><br/>&mdash;description from the publisher<br/><br/>",

        "description": "Achtung Jabo! is a solitaire wargame about the 371st Fighter Group, which flew ground attack missions on D-Day in the P-47D Thunderbolts (known for its famous &quot;Razorback&quot;). Gameplay depicts the Group's missions on D-Day, June 6, 1944, and the book includes extensive research into the techniques, history, and practices of Allied fighter-bomber units at the time of D-Day.<br/><br/>All Game Maps are historically accurate paintings -- 14 in all -- created meticulously with reference to photo reconnaissance images from the time, featuring all of the targets assigned that day. The game focuses on replayability and targets will vary each time you play. Your pilots should expect to encounter German Tiger tanks, Panthers, &quot;Hetzers&quot;, armored half-tracks, Opel Blitz trucks, artillery pieces, and Wehrmacht infantry. You will fly along railroad routes looking for locomotives and rail cars. You will bomb bridges and target gun emplacements, &quot;tobruks&quot; and pillboxes. Beware, the Germans will respond in force with their famous 88 flak guns and rapid-firing quad-20 mm guns for close-in defense. You will be armed with bombs and a full load of bullets for each Thunderbolt's eight .50 cal machine guns.<br/><br/>Just as in history, your Fighter Group's three squadrons will rove across the Normandy countryside in the areas located behind UTAH and OMAHA Beaches. Your overall mission is to prevent the Germans from reinforcing their forces arrayed in defense against the Allied landings, but you never know what targets will present themselves as you fly your assigned patrols. Your mission orders are clear -- and they are exactly the same orders as the 371st Fighter Group actually received that day.<br/><br/>Victory requires you to complete ALL of your assigned missions and hopefully not lose too many of your planes and pilots to enemy fire. It's time to paint D-Day invasion stripes on your planes and get into the air!<br/><br/>&mdash;description from the publisher<br/><br/>",

        "description": "Raketou do Vesmiru (English translation &quot;Rocket Into Space&quot;) is a space race board game for 2-4 players from earth to mars and back. Unknown publisher, this game was produced in Czechoslovakia before manned space flight in 1961.<br/><br/>The game see players with 2 wooden rockets each. One of the rockets is an auxiliary rocket used only if needed when reaching a space station. Players leave earth and progress along a path to the space station (space 95), then mars (space 132) and back to earth (space 183), landing at each place by exact count. The wonderfully futuristic space graphics on the large board (68 x 45cm) has red numbered spaces that cause delays for the traveler, such as Oxygen leaks, magnetic interference and rogue rockets.<br/><br/>Most interesting with this game is instead of a dice to decide player movement a &quot;Rocket Range&quot; determines the count. This is similar to the Carnival Strongman game using a hammer to hit the bell. In Raketou do Vesmiru a wooden rocket slides on a steel rod when released from a spring. The top of the rocket continues along the rod and stops at a number(1 - 10)that determines a players move. If a player launches the rocket too hard, it hits a bell at the top of the &quot;Rocket Launcher&quot; and the player has to move back 10 spaces.<br/><br/>The winner of the game is the player to get to mars and return to earth first.<br/><br/>&mdash;user summary<br/><br/>",

It's a great way to add a bunch of exciting new Enemies, cards, and Missions that are all themed for a specific World or faction in the game.<br/><br/>River of the Dead<br/>The great god Osiris was lord of the dead, ruler of the afterlife, and master of resurrection. The fields would grow at his command and the souls of the dead would be judged in his name, worthy or unworthy to pass on into the afterlife. Killed by his jealous brother Set, Osiris&rsquo;s body was cut into pieces and spread throughout the land, before being re-assembled and resurrected by the power of the goddess Isis, his wife.<br/><br/>It was in this tradition that the Arch-Villain Khamuntet, after finally being defeated millennia ago, was also cut into pieces and sealed away in the hidden tombs of his own dark sorcery, buried deep in the desert sands. Now the fanatical Cult of 'Horus, son of Osiris', seek to reassemble and resurrect Khamuntet in the same way, so he too may pass judgement on mankind, spreading Darkness across the land!<br/><br/>The River of the Dead Enemy Theme Pack comes with a horde of new Egyptian Enemies to challenge your Heroes, as well as new Cult of Horus themed Missions for the Lost Tombs, and over 40 new Game cards with assorted counters. You get 1 Priestess of Judgement, 3 Large Ushabti Warriors, 1 Large Ammut - Eater of the Unworthy, and 6 Osirian River Guards.<br/><br/>Priestess of Judgement<br/>A powerful sorceress in the Cult of Horus, the Priestess of Judgement follows the sect of Osiris, charged with performing the sinister rituals and harnessing the dark magik that will re-forge and resurrect their master, Khamuntet! Possessing the Scales of Truth, her harsh judgements can bring death and destruction to anyone that stands in the way of their master&rsquo;s glorious return, as she unleashes Ammut, devourer of the dead, on her foes.<br/><br/>Ushabti Warriors<br/>Carved of stone and placed in burial chambers and tombs, Ushabti were created to be servants and minions of the dead. They come to life at the call of their master, taking up tools and weapons for the task in need. Though many are created as legions of small figurines, the most terrifying Ushabti Warriors are those sculpted at great size and adorned with hieroglyphics. Crafted in the likeness of Osiris, and armed with hefty Egyptian war axes, these stone warriors are formidable foes when called to war.<br/><br/>Ammut, Eater of the Unworthy<br/>A monstrous creature that combines the front of a lion, hind-quarters of a hippopotamus, and the head of a vicious crocodile, Ammut is a divine beast that feeds on the hearts of those deemed unworthy. When the scales of judgement tip not in your favor, Ammut is ready to devour your soul!<br/><br/>Ammut is a nightmarish Large creature that ruthlessly hunts those found unworthy of joining the blessed dead in the afterlife.<br/><br/>Osirian River Guard<br/>These skeletal warriors guard the River of the Dead. Armed with Dark Stone-tipped spears and heavy shields, they bear the ceremonial dress and armor of the Pharaohs. Nearly unstoppable in their ghastly resolve, they rise back up from the dead to fulfill their sacred duty and bring ruin on any that would defy the judgement of their master.<br/><br/>",

It's a great way to add a bunch of exciting new Enemies, cards, and Missions that are all themed for a specific World or faction in the game.<br/><br/>Fury of the Reich<br/>As a buildup to war in Europe seems all but inevitable, the fascist Reich have begun scouring the globe for ancient and powerful occult relics that could help further their ambitions. Founding an elite and secretive branch of the military known as the Trident Korps, they embark on expeditions into the far reaches of the world, using experimental technology and ruthless cunning to achieve their goals. Researching tales of the lost city of Atlantis, the Trident Korps has dispatched a detachment to the desert sands of Egypt in search of the key to unlocking the power of this ancient fallen kingdom.<br/><br/>The Fury of the Reich Enemy Theme Pack comes with a host of new Pulp Adventure Enemies to challenge your Heroes, as well as new Relic-hunting themed Missions for the Lost Tombs, and over 40 new Game cards with assorted counters. You get 1 Colonel Stein, 6 Reich Soldiers, 1 Tressa - Femme Fatale, 3 Trident Kommandos with Harpoons, and 3 Trident Kommandos with Lightning Guns.<br/><br/>Colonel Stein<br/>A veteran of the Great War, Colonel Stein has seen his share of horrors on the frontlines, both manmade and supernatural. When his unit&rsquo;s trench was overrun with tentacled monstrosities, only his ruthless nature allowed him to survive; but the evil of the Void creatures left their mark, corrupting his flesh with hideous mutation. Rising through the ranks, he now leads a division of the Trident Korps, seeking out occult artifacts and ancient relics that could bring him more of the raw power he felt on that dark night so many years ago.<br/><br/>Reich Soldiers<br/>Reich Soldiers form the backbone of the Trident Korps&rsquo; expeditions. These soldiers are hand-picked from the military ranks for their cold demeanor and fanaticism. Equipped with gear for exploring ancient tombs and temples, the Reich Soldiers carry the deadly MP.36 submachine gun to ensure that they have the upper hand in a fight.<br/><br/>Tressa, Femme Fatale<br/>Using her beauty and cunning to take advantage of her adversaries, Tressa is a cold-hearted killer. Second in command to Colonel Stein, she is in charge of tracking down leads on the locations of the lost tombs and temples in the deep desert. Her disdain for the heat only serves to make her more sadistic in achieving her aims. Fast and agile, Tressa depends on subterfuge and deception, striking the killing blow without warning or remorse.<br/><br/>Trident Kommandos<br/>The Trident Kommandos are elite troopers armed with powerful advanced weapons and armor, harnessing the power of the Void to their own evil ends. Their suits are engineered for exploring OtheWorlds and harsh environments like the deep sea. They are at the forefront in the hunt for the Lost Kingdom of Pharrox and the priceless treasures and technology that could be found in the Sunken City.<br/><br/>",

The Chaos of Time mission allows characters to use Abilities of their allies with a one round cooldown penalty. Finally, in the Chaos of Events mission players get Event cards that can be played in a special way, with their effects applied only one time and only to one character or one suitable condition.<br/><br/>Whenever a mission is completed, both players score Victory Points: the winner gets 3 VPs, while the loser gets VPs based on the number of damage points the opponent&rsquo;s Castle has suffered. When the campaign is over, the player with the most VPs wins. In case of a tie, both players share the victory.<br/><br/>Take advantage of chaos to battle against your opponent under unpredictable conditions!<br/><br/>",

Take on the role of a director and invent crazy stories, defeating criminals with thunderous blows. Right jab, left slap in the face or the infamous hammer fist: anything is allowed, it...<br/><br/>Each player starts with 5 BEANS cards on the table. Each BEANS card represents one kind of blow (left punch, right punch, double punch, left slap, right slap). The cards must lie covered on the table, in front of the player.<br/><br/>Each turn, one of the players performs the role of the director. The director chooses randomly a BOOM and a BANG card from the stacks on the table. BOOM and BANG cards describe places and situations. The sum of the points printed on the two cards are the points earned by the player who will win the turn.<br/><br/>The director, following the suggestion provided by the cards he picked, invents a story. He cries out &quot;Action!&quot; and all the players must put their hands on their knees. At a given point of the story, the director will name a blow at his choice, such as &quot;Right punch&quot;, or &quot;Double punch&quot;. The players should beat the table performing the right action. The first one who succeeds wins the turn, and therefore removes the BEANS card in front of him corresponding to the action requested by the director.<br/><br/>The game ends when a player get rid of all his BEANS cards or if a player have eaten too many sausages or drunk to much beer. Sausages and beer cards are part of the BOOM and BANGS decks. If a player has more than one beer or sausages, the game ends early and the winner is the one with the highest number of points.<br/><br/>",

So we&rsquo;re creating a brand-new story: It&rsquo;s July 4th weekend, and this little town of Clarion, Pennsylvania, is having a big drive-in for the holiday. They wake up to a newspaper report that these Ghost Face killers are running around and killing people. The idea is that the police officers have figured out that this Ghost Face (or Ghost Faces &ndash; key!) is headed to the big drive-in to kill a bunch of people. And it features nine masks in the line. So you&rsquo;re gonna get the gold Ghost Face, the devil Ghost Face, the orange, the green, the scarecrow, the aged one. The idea is to celebrate the line of Ghost Face masks that Fun World has been cranking out but aren&rsquo;t in any of the movies &hellip; it&rsquo;s a brand-new adventure for Ghost Face. He&rsquo;s still killing.<br/><br/>Unlike the other Stop the Killer games, we have a multiple-killer angle, which you find out throughout the game, and it&rsquo;s different with every game, whether there are one, two, or three killers you have to stop.

This does not count as your one action and is mandatory. <br/>     with any remaining cards left in your hand you may choose to play a boat card into your fleet in front of you or (provided you have an available boat to place a fish on), you may play a fishermen card to catch one of the available fish from the center of the table.<br/>     When a boat has the required number of fish on it, that boat can immediately be &quot;docked&quot; for it's victory points. <br/>     once you've taken your one action, play continues clockwise to the next player who draws one card at random from your hand before drawing up their remaining hand limit of 5 from the central draw deck. <br/>     The shark or pirate cards can show up in any players hand at any time and if that player chooses to, they may use it for their one action to attack another players fleet.<br/>     The shark is able to destroy another players boat and cause that boat to be discarded along with any fish on it. <br/>     The pirate can be used in a similar way however instead of destroying the boat, the pirate is used to steal the fish on that boat. <br/>     In a defensive play, if the player being attacked is holding the &quot;chum&quot; card, that player can send the shark to attack another player instead of themselves. <br/>     Pirate and Shark attacks can both be defended against by playing the Jed Fishworthy (dynamite Fishermen) card. In this defensive play, the player being attacked discards the Jed Fishworthy card in order to immediately stop the attack and send the Pirate or Shark to the discard pile, which is then reshuffled back into the central draw deck. <br/><br/><br/>&mdash;description from the designer<br/><br/>",

        "description": "Blast off for adventure with Star Schlock&mdash;the tabletop miniatures game inspired by sci-fi of the 1970s and 80s!  Use miniatures from the growing line of Star Schlock figures&mdash;who may bear an uncanny, yet legally distinct resemblance to familiar sci-fi tropes&mdash;to wage intergalactic war on your kitchen table.<br/><br/>Fortunes can swing dramatically in Star Schlock! Mount sweeping charges against your enemy's flank! Risk it all with a plan so crazy it might just work! This isn't a passive game where you set your figures up and spend two hours seeing if your deployment decisions worked. You'll need to think hard to use the limited resources at hand to outwit your opponent, push your units to the limit of their capability, and exploit the vulnerable spots in your opponent's strategy.<br/><br/>Play a nail-biting game against a single opponent on a 3'x3' battlefield, or bring the game to your club and play an epic six-player confrontation on a sprawling 4'x6' table (or larger!). Star Schlock is a flexible system built to handle a variety of gaming group sizes.<br/><br/>Use the rules for your universe, or come play in ours. The Star Schlock rules emulate the adventures of the long running Canadian sci-fi series of the same name (it ran for 20 years&mdash;surely you've heard of it?). From the Explorer Corps boldly going where none have gone before, to the madhouse that is the Space Ape home world, the Star Schlock universe is full of space princesses, mystical crystal knights, infectious mutants, plucky robots, and a host of other familiar sci-fi tropes. The Starter Set is the perfect place to jump in as we kick off the Galactic War that would be fought onscreen, in comics, novels, and trading cards for two decades!<br/><br/>Dozens of character and unit profiles already detail the denizens of the Star Schlock universe, with more to come. Gather  troops with abilities that synergize with each other to unleash epic combos that will leave your opponents reeling!<br/><br/>&mdash;description from the publisher<br/><br/>",
