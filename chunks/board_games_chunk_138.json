Explore the woods near Mother's Cottage, rescue trapped animals, and make sure you never have more than four curses upon you at a time! Will you be able to save the Enchanted Bear and defeat the Ungrateful Dwarf? Or will you become cursed too?<br/><br/>Each turn the sisters travel to different locations around the board to have encounters.  These encounters can lead to rescuing animal companions, gaining useful items, collection treasure, encountering the Ungrateful Dwarf, or encountering the Enchanted Bear.  Watch out for the curses!  Curses make it harder for the sisters to complete their goals!  The encounters at the locations are different depending on which sisters are present, and if both sisters are there.<br/><br/>This game can be played solo where one person controls one or two of the sisters, or can be played as a full co-op where both sisters quest to save the Enchanted Bear.<br/><br/>",

What she didn't realize is that a deadly Siberian tiger stalks these mountains too! Find the adult snow leopard before you find the Siberian tiger to win in this game of frolics turned fatal!<br/><br/>In this game, one or two players play a group of four snow leopard cubs who are in danger!  They must find their mother before the Siberian Tiger finds them.  The board is made up of thirty cards, played face down.  Twenty-eight of those cards are mountains, one is the adult snow leopard, one is the Siberian tiger.<br/><br/>On each player's turn, as long as they hold a snow leopard cub in their hand, they may swap that card with any card on the board.  The card they take is revealed.  If it is a mountain, nothing happens.  If it is the Siberian tiger, all is lost.  If it is the adult snow leopard, they win!<br/><br/>If the adult snow leopard or Siberian tiger hasn't yet been found, for each snow leopard cub already on the board, the player can flip face-up one card that is located diagonally adjacent to the snow leopard cub card. These cards are flipped down at the end of the turn.<br/><br/>Once all the snow leopard cub cards have been played, players may retrieve a snow leopard cub card on their next turn by swapping it back out with a Mountain card in your hand.  When playing a two-player game, this means you can start to retrieve your cards after playing two, instead of all four.<br/><br/>This game can be played solo, with one person controlling all four snow leopard cubs, or fully co-op with two players playing two cubs each.<br/><br/>",

        "description": "A mansion in French Quarter has been the center of woe for 30 years. Its taxes are paid, and the power is on, but no one has seen anything in the house for years. Suddenly you have received an invitation that requests you to come for dinner at this address. &quot;I know what you are looking for, and you will find the answers you need here on this night&quot;. You have just been invited to play A House in New Orleans A game for 2-6 players. Some will call it a player deduction game or a game with a traitor mechanism, but most will call it horrifyingly intense. <br/>You are invited to A House in New Orleans come hungry.<br/><br/>The game takes place in an old mansion in New Orleans. Each room contains two item cards face down. Players select unique characters with special abilities and stats. They will move from room to room discovering items. Some may be traps that impede players, some may be special items that improve a character. You may only choose to carry one item, so every room will provide a new discovery and a decision.<br/><br/>Human Goal:<br/>Players are attempting to find all three items that their character requires. When one player finds all three items the game is over.  If all but one player has 2 items, the game is over as well. Each of the collected items has a point value and the points are totaled at the end of the game. You must be careful what items you choose to collect, if the items you collect are of too low a point value a player with fewer items may still win.<br/><br/>Vampire goal:<br/>Did I mention a lonely vampire has disguised themselves among the dinner guests? The goal for the original vampire is not to acquire items themselves, but to &quot;Turn&quot; human players that have already acquired items. You see, nothing tastes as good as hope. If a human is attacked and can&rsquo;t fend off the vampire, they are now secretly a vampire themselves looking for their victim. If the vampire is successfully fended off the vampire is not &ldquo;revealed&rdquo; and may become invisible (hidden player movement).  If the vampire turns a player, the new vampire gains points for the items they have already acquired but give the Vampire that turned them points as well. They do not give their &quot;Parent&quot; vampire points from the new victims they acquire. The closer a human player is to completing their goal the more valuable they are, but the more human players you &quot;Turn&quot; the more competition you make for yourself.  If you wait too long, they may be able to fend you off<br/><br/>The Clock:<br/>The old grandfather clock gongs on the hour, at which time a new event card is turned over. These events are random but become worse for the humans as the game progresses. The humans may skip an event if they place an item that turn. Do you help the other humans even though it may mean losing the game to avoid the next horrible event..it is up to you.<br/><br/>Does it sound simple? It is simple to learn, and as complex as the mind of the players that you play against.<br/><br/>",

        "description": "In The Clockwork Conundrum, after each player receives 3 cards and 3 pawns, a modular board is formed 5 cards wide x 5 cards high (cards are left face down), surrounding a single victory card. All players besides the start player may examine their cards, and place these however desired. The start player may only see his cards after choosing which card to begin with. He places his pawn on this card.<br/><br/>Most cards have a L, M, R, or C in their upper right corner. These stand for Left, Middle, Right, and Choice. When the start player reveals his start card, it determines where the next player places his pawn. This unleashes a chain of events. The last player's pawn placement will indicate the two to four movement options for the start player. (These are indicated by direction markers on each card.) His subsequent move will indicate the next player's move and so on. This can be treacherous given the players don't know the cards they are moving to until they make their moves. It is entirely possible that a player may be forced off of the board, or onto one of the more bizarre action cards.<br/><br/>1) FREEZE: If a player settles on this card, the next player in turn order may not move. Instead whichever card he previously settled on will indicate the next player's movement options.<br/><br/>2) LAVA: If a player stumbles into a lava pit, he loses one of his three pawns and starts over on the start card indicated by the lava card.<br/><br/>3) MIRROR MIRROR: If a player settles onto a Mirror Mirror card, the next player in turn order will move across the board to the card in the mirror position.<br/><br/>4) +PAWN: If a player settles onto a +Pawn card, he adds a second pawn to the start card of his choice. This increases his movement options, since he will still only move 1 pawn at a time. Therefore, his likelihood of reaching his destination is significantly increased.<br/><br/>5) REVERSE: If a player settles onto a Reverse card, the turn order is reversed, and the player who preceded him must move in the direction indicated by the card on which he is currently settled.<br/><br/>The game only uses 37 cards. There are 41 in total. But the remaining cards are not totally useless. While increasing the variety of the modular board, the cards also help to resolve conflicts if a player has settled onto a card where his opponent is currently positioned. Each card, excluding the Victory Card, has a number 1-40. When players are involved in a conflict, each draws a card at random, and the player with the higher card gains the space, whereas the player with the lower card loses his pawn.<br/><br/>Usually any cards revealed are left face-up, but there is also a Memory Variant where after moving to a new location, any cards not currently active are flipped back to face-down.<br/><br/>Due to the unique design of the game, it may also be played cooperatively, as players work together to lead one to the Victory Card.<br/><br/>The Clockwork Conundrum is an intense puzzle game. And due to its featuring nearly 100,000 ways to set up, it is highly replayable. Who will gain the victory in a game where your next moves are triggered by your opponent?<br/><br/>",

        "description": "The Mind &amp; Emotions game explores our head and heart. In the beautiful box is a playing board, 120 cards, and a single die.<br/><br/>The game is based on the idea that we all have positive and negative states of mind, and positive and negative emotional states. The playing board has 3 columns with mind states on the left, and 3 columns of emotional states on the right. The positive states are on the top, and the negative states are on the bottom.<br/><br/>There are 2 piles of cards - 60 mind cards with blue backs, and 60 emotion cards with maroon backs. On the top of each card is one of the 12 mind &amp; emotion states. In the middle of the card is a word that is an example of that mind or emotion state.<br/><br/>Each player takes a turn picking a card, and uses the word on that card to add to a developing story that&rsquo;s interesting and fun.<br/><br/>For example, let&rsquo;s say the first player picks the word SHY and begins the story: &quot;Ever since Barry was a little boy, he was always SHY and had trouble socializing in groups.&quot; <br/>The next player picks the word: INVESTIGATE, and continues the story: &quot;One day Barry was reading the newspaper about a neighborhood near where he lived. The article described houses that sounded like an excellent investment, and he decided to INVESTIGATE.&quot; <br/>The next player picks the word NEGLECTFUL, and says: &quot;When Barry arrived at the neighborhood, he saw that it was run down, looking as if the owners were NEGLECTFUL of the most basic repairs.&quot; <br/>While telling the story, the players move their pieces on the board trying to get each of their pieces into a top or bottom end zone. We&rsquo;ll now describe the rules of the game.<br/><br/>2 to 6 players can play. Each player gets two pieces that are placed on the start section in the middle of the board, one on the left mind side, and the other on the right emotion side of the board. Each player moves one piece up and down the mind side, and the other piece up and down the emotion side. The goal is to get each piece in either the top or bottom end zones.<br/><br/>On your turn:<br/><br/>Roll the die to see how many spaces to move either piece. <br/>Then pick a card from either the mind or emotion pile, and say out loud the category and word you picked. <br/>If you picked a mind card, move your mind piece. If you picked an emotion card, move your emotion piece. If the word you picked is positive, move your piece up. If the word you picked is negative, move your piece down. <br/>If the die is 2, 4, or 5, move your piece that many spaces. If the die is 3 or 6, move your piece 3 spaces up OR down. If the die is 1, roll again right away, and on this move you can move up OR down.<br/>So there are two goals of the game. The first goal is to tell an interesting and fun story together. The second goal is to be the first to get both of your pieces to an end zone. The end zones do not have to be reached by an exact number of moves.<br/><br/>Positive-mind cards: <br/>Analyzing, Interested, Aware <br/>Negative-mind cards: <br/>Oblivious, Uninterested, Unaware <br/>Positive-emotion cards: <br/>Up, Outward, Warm <br/>Negative-emotion cards: <br/>Down, Inward, Cold<br/><br/>You and your friends will enjoy many hours together playing the game of Mind and Emotions!!<br/><br/>",

The competition to win the title of World&rsquo;s Greatest Magician brings out the worst in these rivals who won&rsquo;t hesitate at a chance to ruin the act. Fortunately, a good magician always has an assistant at their side and a trick up their sleeve&hellip;<br/><br/>Magician's Club is a &quot;Trick-Breaking&quot; game where players are Magicians who play Trick Cards for points. Moving around the table, the other players will try to &quot;break&quot; their trick by decreasing or modifying the Magician's tricks using conjure cards. The Magician can cancel out some cards by using his assistant cards but they are one-time use only cards, so play them wisely. When play returns back to the Magician, they can play one more card and then collect the trick for points (either positive or negative)<br/><br/>After all the players have had a chance to be the on-stage Magician, the points are totaled up. A second chance to score happens at the end of the game by counting up collected cards that have a similar suit. The player with the most points wins!<br/><br/>",

While untold sailors have met their grim end by these sea monsters, an intrepid few have welcomed the challenge of discovering them with timeless rumors as their only guide.<br/><br/>In Monstra Maris, 2 to 4 players each control a small fleet of ships, represented by wooden discs, that they sail across the board with the flick of a finger.

When a player flicks a ship disc onto one of these locations, he or she is awarded points for the discovery and granted an experience token for end-game scoring. Players also hope to avoid the storms and pirates that may come their way, thanks to their opponents. The game ends after one player has discovered twelve monsters, and the player with the most points is declared the winner.<br/><br/>",

No, seriously, we had the space - why not use it?<br/><br/>Thus we are proud to bring you the 'Unexpected Mini Expansion'!<br/><br/>Including:<br/><br/>Evil Knievette - The only card that can take things from the Ditch! What a Buddy.<br/>Sensual Simon - This troll who just wants to come in for &quot;a coffee&quot;. He's one sexy Enemy.<br/>Story Time - During this Event Uncle Morty tells truly terrifying tales.<br/>Lynched By Witches - Something isn't right with this Ordeal. Shouldn't we be lynching the witches?<br/>Think About Feet - An Effect to make your opponents think too much about feet!<br/><br/>We will bundle it with your game, so do it now before we send your game.

        "description": "Subtitled &quot;A New Adult Card Game&quot;, this Depression-era publication requires players to a set of cards either by trading with other players or by &quot;snooping&quot; in the &quot;gutter&quot;. The game has 45 cards. The five Scavenger cards each list eight items that the player drawing it must collect. The other 40 cards are the items to be collected.<br/><br/>Each player starts with 25 tokens, and antes one into the pot before each hand. The four players draw one Scavenger list card blind, and get dealt a hand of eight cards, with the remaining eight stacked face down in the gutter.<br/><br/>On his turn a player may either trade (offering one or two cards from his hand for an equal number from any player) or snoop by drawing one or two cards from the gutter, paying a token into the pot, and discarding an equal number of cards from his hand, face down, to the bottom of the gutter pile. Each player in a trade decides which card(s) to give up and passes them without declaring what they are. Players may not refuse a trade offer, even if they have to give up a card they need.<br/><br/>The first player to complete his full scavenging list of eight items wins the hand and takes the pot. The game can continue as long as players desire (and have tokens left). The game can be played with 2 or 3 players by eliminating one scavenger card and its set of 8 objects per player less than four.<br/><br/>",

It is up to the player to decide what&rsquo;s the best strategy for each member of their club.<br/><br/>Players move by rolling 3 custom movement dice. They can attribute any of the rolled results to any of their bikers. around the straight race track board is a number of special spaces that allow players to either get an immediate boost, which lets them roll a custom boost die, or pick up Tune-Up cards.<br/><br/>Tune-Up cards can buff a player's attack, give them special abilities, or disrupt their opponent's turns with a few nasty 'Take-That' type instant play cards!<br/><br/>The winner of TRBO is the player with the last active biker club on the track.<br/><br/>",

        "description": "Historical Background<br/><br/>Manchukuo was a puppet state of the Japanese Empire.  The Japanese seized the area in 1931 on the fabricated pretext of Chinese aggression known as the Mukden Incident.  In truth, the Japanese desired the region (known as Manchuria) for its extensive wealth of minerals.  The Japanese attempted to bring large numbers of settlers into the area to colonize and farm and during the Japanese occupation Manchukuo&rsquo;s industrial base expanded rapidly.  Cities, factories and railways were modernized.  Between 1938 and 1942 about 200,000 Japanese farmers immigrated to Manchukuo.  The Soviets reportedly captured and repatriated 850,000 Japanese settlers after their invasion of Manchukuo in 1945.  The Japanese used Manchuria to prepare for war, creating industry and infrastructure to support their planned conquest of Asia.<br/><br/>Resistance to the Japanese occupation grew with time.  By 1935 a combination of anti-Japanese forces including Communists and Korean resistance fighters totaling about 40,000 men formed into armies.  The Communist Chinese (CCP) operated guerilla units inside the occupied territory that targeted Japanese occupiers but also spread the social ideals of the party. Until 1937 resistance fighters engaged in anti-government operations designed to subvert Japanese governance.  After the war began these fighters presented a serious threat to the Japanese and Manchukuo government who were continually forced to use their troops to deal with them.  It took until 1942 for the Japanese to pacify the region.<br/><br/>The Japanese were not without competition; the Soviet Union had long had designs on Manchuria.   The Japanese and Soviets fought a number of border skirmishes between 1935 and 1939.<br/><br/>Welcome to Manchukuo!  A battleground of occupiers, liberators, and revolutionaries!  In the expansion set Manchukuo your alliance will battle for the control of resources, industry and ultimately, the destiny of this important region.<br/><br/>SET CONTENTS<br/><br/>&bull;    Manchukuo Nation Roundel (x5)<br/>&bull;    CCP Nation Roundel (x3)<br/>&bull;    Infantry (x6)<br/>&bull;    Motorized Infantry (x1)<br/>&bull;    BA-6 Armored Car (x1)<br/>&bull;    Cavalry (Painted) x1<br/>&bull;    Artillery (x2)<br/>&bull;    Militia Marker (x2)<br/>&bull;    Manchukuo Imperial Guard Marker (x1)<br/>&bull;    Kwangtung Army Marker (x4)<br/>&bull;    Patrol River Boat Marker (x2)<br/>&bull;    Minor Factory Marker (x2)<br/><br/>",

One artist picks up the top card from each deck, chooses one, and shares it with the other artists, who start drawing the phrase at the same time.  The first team to guess the phrase wins the round.  After every artist has picked a card to draw, a new artist is selected from each team.<br/><br/>The team that guesses the phrase correctly first wins a point. After players have played any desired number of rounds, the team with the most points is declared champion.<br/><br/>The game allows for multiple methods of play, such as acting out and playing as every person for themselves. There is even a kid friendly way to play using only the angel deck, and a more adult way to play using only the devil deck.<br/><br/>",

        "description": "Description from the publisher:<br/><br/>Welcome to the HMS Heartbreak, a luxury escape pod hurtling through the infamous Nobelle Quadrant- home of the largest Space Mall! Well, former space mall, now it's just a debris field filled with old junk from planet Earth.  You are one of six passengers sharing a cozy, hi-tech escape pod. Try not to kill each other as you make your way to safety. While you're at it, why not pick up some retro Earth antiques along the way with the tractor beam? Heartbreak EP takes players to the darker side of moons with a punk-rock attitude. Space may be vast, but for passengers aboard the HMS Heartbreak, it's about to feel a whole lot smaller.<br/><br/>Heartbreak EP is a semi-cooperative game of passive aggression. Players need to work together to keep their vessel intact long enough to get to a registered safe planet. The only problem is, you've got frenemies. Each player harbors profound hatred towards another crew member for reasons that don't have to be explained. Can you work together despite your rivalries?<br/><br/>At the beginning of every round, all players will roll their action dice. All players are able to view the results of each die. On a player's turn they will assign dice to the growing number of events that threaten the ship or use them to power their station. Each station performs a function crucial to the operation of the escape pod. Share resources, take resources, or do nothing at all! You didn't choose to be stuck in a pod with them! Bluh.<br/><br/>Heartbreak EP brings new meaning to the expression &quot;Give me some space&quot;, and includes play modes for solitaire, fully cooperative, semi-cooperative, team vs team, and traitors.<br/><br/>",

The category of the first question is determined by the position of the spinning wheel on the board, the other two are chosen by the player himself. For every right answer the player marks 1 row on the triangle for that decennium. Three right answers make a 'golden triangle' and give the player the right to mark a row in the 2000 triangle.<br/><br/>Players can try to replace other players' markers by answering questions right in a decennium where the other player has already put markers.<br/>Golden triangles might be overtaken by a 'coup'. The player can now choose the categories of all his 3 questions, but they all have to be right.<br/><br/>The game ends when a player has a golden triangle on the 2000 triangle.<br/><br/>",

        "description": "This game consists of a deck of 15 large cards, each bearing the name, picture and price of an item that might be sold by a wandering peddler, and four decks (cream, orange, red and blue) of 15 small cards, each with a typical farm product and value.<br/><br/>One player takes the role of the Yankee Peddler, while the others are farmers. On each turn, the peddler places one of his goods face up, while the farmers each play one of their goods cards. The farmer with the highest value card takes the peddler's item, and the peddler writes down the difference between the value of what he sold and what he accepted as his profit (or loss) on that card.<br/><br/>The play repeats until the cards are exhausted. At that point, the peddler adds up his net profit, while the farmers add up the total value of the goods they have purchased. If the peddler's profit is greater than the total value purchased by any farmer, he wins; otherwise, the farmer with the greatest value of products wins.<br/><br/>The rules say that for two players, both are farmers competing for peddler cards as they are turned over. For 5 or 6 players, the farmer cards are distributed equally, but it is suggested that the peddler again be a non-player, as otherwise the peddler will almost certainly win.<br/><br/>",

The offensive player pushes a metal arrow down onto one of his circles. The defensive player does the same, simply numbering them 1-5. The results are shown on a table on the board. There is a second table for kicks and runbacks. The usual football rules apply and high score wins.<br/><br/>The game itself is undated, but it is very similar to Wiry Dan's Electric Baseball.

        "description": "This 1930s game is a rather simple and odd representation of a yacht race from Montauk Point to Bermuda. The game requires players to choose a point of sailing (Tack to Windward, Reach, Free Reach, Run with the Wind), and yet the game ignores the actual direction of the wind.<br/><br/>The course is a straight line of 30 spaces, and players use a 1-20 spinner. The spinner number gives a result from the table for each of the four points of sailing. So one player can tack to windward while his neighbour runs before the win - even though they are both moving in the same direction!<br/><br/>",

        "description": "This undated but likely 1930s British title is an odd combination of two unrelated games using a single mechanism. It consists of a metal spinning disk on top of a spinning arm with a white pointer and circle on one end and a red pointer on the other, all mounted in a yellow metal bowl.<br/><br/>The first game is a dog race. The spinning wheel is divided in six equal and color-coded segments with an illustration of a running dog in those colors. Each segment is divided into four unequal pieces marked with different payout odds (2-1, 4-1, 6-1 and 8-1). Players place bets on a separate betting mat divided into the six color boxes and spin the wheel. Where the pointer stops, that dog wins at the indicated odds and everyone else loses their bets. The player ending with the most money wins.<br/><br/>Outside the dog segments, however, the wheel is divided into 32 segments, each with a single letter. Each letter of the alphabet appears once, except for the five vowels (which get 2 spaces each) and a final square marked &quot;any letter&quot;. The rules for this game are not clear absent the instructions, but a box illustration says that &quot;Every correct word scores&quot;, suggesting that players perhaps must come up with as many words as possible starting with the letter spun, or including both letters on the opposite ends of the pointer.<br/><br/>",

The card may benefit or penalize them.<br/><br/>Units are placed on the map's intersections, so every unit usually has six directions in which it can move in. You can capture (i.e. remove from the board) enemy units by encircling them.

They always go against you by activating their special trick if you refuse to play with them.<br/><br/>On the other hand, there are also job cards that will grant you unique professional skills and toys for your kittens.<br/><br/>In order to win, you need to take advantage of your event cards in a way that benefits you as a player, while simultaneously overwhelming the rest of the players with kittens. When a player gathers five kittens, he or she will turn into the crazy cat person. The crazy cat person will receive no benefits from his or her job card resulting in victory being unachievable. Instead this player will now have the ability to throw cats at normal people, taking revenge from the players that led to his or her state.<br/><br/>The winner is the one able to keep him or herself mentally sane.<br/><br/>",

The die result can potentially destroy either the attacker or defender (but not both) based on the odds.<br/><br/>A simplified concealment rule is used for ground units (including bases), the type of unit remaining unknown by the opponent until engaged in combat or spied on.<br/><br/>The goal of the game is the elimination of the opponent's three immobile bases.<br/><br/>",

Who could say for sure? We wanted to dramatize that struggle through the best story-telling medium ever created: card games.<br/><br/>The basic idea is simple: gather and combine different resources to create and secure technologies for your cave person. Trade with your opponents or steal their hard-fought technologies outright. But watch out - the prehistoric world is rife with dangers like stampeding woolly mammoths and fiery balls of destruction from outer space. Also, religion.<br/><br/>",

The US 2nd Corps (now commanded by General Omar Bradley) attacked Hill 609 in &ldquo;Mousetrap Valley&quot;, with the objective of advancing to Mateur. The British 5th Corps attacked &ldquo;Longstop Hill&rdquo; and &ldquo;Peter&rsquo;s Corner&rdquo; and the British 9th Corps attacks between Boubellat and Bou Arada. Part of Operation Vulcan, the final Allied offensive to clear Axis forces from Tunisia, particularly the Cape Bon area, saw the Hermann Goering Division sitting astride positions at &lsquo;Cactus Farm&rsquo;. The elite German paratroop formation would be challenged by the British 4th &lsquo;Mixed&rsquo; Division, an infantry unit reconstituted after Dunkirk as an infantry division incorporating a brigade of tanks. As the unit&rsquo;s Churchills approached the farm, their supporting infantry was shot to pieces. The tanks continued the advance without infantry support and were then attacked in close combat by enemy soldiers. Twelve Churchills were knocked out and the attack was abruptly halted.<br/><br/>TOBRUK 2016 EXPANSION 6: TUNISIA II includes 8 scenarios in color format, a selection of new AFV counters in the new colorway, including AEC I, Churchill I, Churchill III, Tiger I, Pzkw IIIL, Pzkw IIIn, Bishop, and more -- including new camo schemes!

Four wooden poles, 6.75 inches long and with horizontal holes drilled through near the top, are placed into holes on the corners where wooden feet support the board.<br/><br/>On each of the east and west sides, a string is run from a central hook (metal mounted on a wooden ball and plastic base with holes for the string) up to one of the corner poles, through a blue plastic bead, across to the other pole on the same side, and then back down to the hook.<br/><br/>Six wooden cylinders, each with a letter on top and horizontal openings near the top, are set into holes in the map of Scotland. The players must manipulate the beads so that the hook catches a cylinder, lifts it up, and then moves it over and into its corresponding hole in the North Sea (e.g. the N cylinder goes into the Ninian field).<br/><br/>The player who successfully moves all the pegs in the fastest time wins. The rules suggest the game can be made even more challenging by having players work in teams, with each manipulating one side of the hook.<br/><br/>While the game is undated, it is likely 1976-77, since the latest oil field named on the map is the Argyll, discovered in 1975.<br/><br/>",

        "description": "Description from the publisher:<br/><br/>This is the twenty second battle in our series of the American Civil Wargames in 3D. The Confederate Army is attacking the outpost of Harpers Ferry.<br/><br/>Historically Major General Thomas J &ldquo;Stonewall&rdquo; Jackson has been assigned with the capture of the outpost of Harpers Ferry. It is a Federal arsenal that the Confederates need to acquire in their march across Maryland.<br/><br/>Harpers Ferry is a single day battle that has a time limit of 14 bounds. The Confederates must capture Harpers Ferry and disperse the Union forces. The games design allows for a fast, fun and realistic game within a 1-2 hour period of continuous play. The game gives a flavor of the American Civil War period and a simple chain of command solution adds intrigue to the game, keep the chain of command together and everything is fine, lose it and it could cost you the game?<br/><br/>Combat is designed around the three factors that appear on the unit counters, these indicate the Range, Attack and Strength of the represented unit. You don&rsquo;t even need any dice to play the game since a dice tile system is included with the game, but if you want to roll dice then it&rsquo;s the simple six sided variety that you will require.<br/><br/>The game board is designed to be used either 2 dimensional as a straight print and play or 3 dimensional, this takes a little more time to construct but it is well worth the effort for the impressive game board you get at its completion. The final 3D game board gives you a realistic feel to the terrain and shows the tactical dispositions of all the game counters.<br/><br/>Included with the download is the 3D Game Board in two halves, the Harpers Ferry seven page Battle Rules, the Gaming Counters, a simple guide on how to build a 3D Game Board, the Brothers At Arms twenty one page Rules Booklet with Playsheet, a twenty four hour Timeline Table and finally a set of Tile Dice. The game rules are fast and easy to learn and will be the same throughout the full series of American Civil War in 3D.<br/><br/>Can you continue this great series of battles with another victory? Play North or South in this the twenty second game of the American Civil War in 3D series of board games.<br/><br/>",

        "description": "A two-player soccer simulation cardgame.<br/><br/>Players draft their squad of 11 from the 22 available players (whose names are parodies of famous professionals) each rated in 6 offensive and defensive categories.  They then pick their 7-man formations, consisting of one keeper and from 1 to 4 players in defense, midfield and attack.<br/><br/>The objective of the game is to move the ball between your players so that you can score a goal. A successful pass moves the ball along the player line or up 1 player line. A successful thru ball or Long pass moves the ball up 2 lines. A successful shot is a goal. Simple right? But if you are unsuccessful in any play, your opponent gets possession and starts their attack.<br/><br/>Once a play is selected, the managers will roll against each other in the battle box to see who wins that challenge. Turning over the game cards may just be the difference as they influence the play.<br/><br/>",

Play backgammon like you've never played before in this clever card game of modified moves and devilish twists.<br/><br/>To play the game you need a classic set of Backgammon.<br/><br/>The objective, as in classic backgammon, is to remove all of one's own checkers from the board before one's opponent can do the same. Whoever achieves the objective first, is the winner.<br/><br/>The game consists of some classic backgammon variants and cards that modify gameplay by playing one card during a regular turn. The basic backgammon strategy of trying to move pieces along the playing area remains the same, but many elements may change, from dice results to pieces and their allegiance. Each card in Dargammon has that element of twist and take that, which makes the game even more strategic than before.<br/><br/>",

It would be nearly impossible to see all of the park in a single day&mdash;but let&rsquo;s try!<br/><br/>Golden Gate Park is a fast-playing board game for 2-4 players. In the game, each player assumes the role of a married couple spending a day visiting historic Golden Gate Park during their trip to San Francisco.<br/><br/>Players begin the game having just arrived from their hotel to the Music Concourse at the heart of Golden Gate Park. The time is 10:00am on a gorgeous weekend morning. Players will take turns traveling about the park visiting its varied attractions, ending the day at 5:30pm sharp for the trip back the hotel.<br/><br/>Every action taken by a player takes a certain amount of time, which must be spent wisely throughout the game. Walk, shuttle or taxi to places like the bison paddock, Stow Lake, Shakespeare Garden, or the California Academy of Sciences. In between attractions you will need to find time to eat&mdash;perhaps at the famed Beach Chalet&mdash;and to answer the call of nature. And you don&rsquo;t have unlimited funds so be sure to mind your budget for the day.<br/><br/>You will accumulate&mdash;or possibly lose!&mdash;valuable experience points along the way, with the player having had the best experience for the day declared the winner.<br/><br/>Components:<br/>&bull; a 17&rdquo; x 44&rdquo; mounted board<br/>&bull; one sheet of die-cut tiles <br/>&bull; four custom dice<br/>&bull; 84 wooden cubes, discs and meeples in four player colors<br/>&bull; wooden time tracker<br/>&bull; cloth bag<br/>&bull; rulebook<br/><br/>",

        "description": "This 1930s Canadian baseball game may be the only existing baseball title that actually features a Canadian maple leaf on the chest of a player on the box top.<br/><br/>While undated, it was probably issued around 1936-7, when a foundering Toronto Maple Leafs baseball team was rescued from a buyout and transfer to Albany, NY, by a group of local investors headed by former Ontario Lieutenant-Governor William Donald Ross.<br/><br/>The game itself is rather basic. It has a folding thin cardboard field and 18 small wooden player disks (9 blue, 9 red). While there are circles on the field and bench for these pieces, their only real function is to mark baserunners.<br/><br/>To bat, players simply roll 2D6, and read the resulting play off a 2-12 table in the rules. The odds are not realistic: the most likely result (7) produces a double, and a batter will get on base almost half the time (17/36). Normal baseball rules apply, with the player scoring the most runs after nine innings winning.<br/><br/>",

        "description": "This mid-1930s title was probably the last American football game published in which the drop kick and place kick were shown as different ways to attempt a field goal or extra point - with the drop kick being more likely to succeed. The standard football was made more pointed at the ends in 1934 to make it easier to pass, but the new shape made drop kicks much less reliable, and almost all scoring attempts since have been place kicks.<br/><br/>The game uses the sum of 2D6 to resolve each play. The offensive player has 10 play options (Left End, Left Tackle, Left Guard, Center, Right Guard, Right Tackle, Right End, Spinner Play, Trick Play and Pass). Each of these plays, along with Drop Kick, Place Kick, Punt, Punt Return, Kickoff and Kickoff Return) has its own results column showing yards gained  or lost along with possible fumbles and interceptions.<br/><br/>The board has an unusual mechanism for recording the game's progress. It comes with just two pawns, one for recording downs, the other the number of plays. The field has four groups of lines stretching from one end of the field to the other to mark the downs (single, double, triple and quadruple lines), and the ball marker is moved from one to the next to mark downs as well as back and forth to show line of scrimmage. The second peg marks off plays at the end of the board, with a quarter ending after 25 plays and the game after 100. Usual football scoring applies, with most points after 100 plays winning.<br/><br/>",

Each player should have 26 cards. Each of you lay out 10 cards in 4 stock piles in a single row in front of you as follows:<br/><br/>Stock Pile 1 &ndash; 1 card face up<br/>Stock Pile 2 &ndash; 1 card face down and 1 card face up on top<br/>Stock Pile 3 &ndash; 2 cards face down and 1 card face up on top<br/>Stock Pile 4 &ndash; 3 cards face down and 1 card face up on top<br/><br/>Place the remaining 16 cards face down in a pile to the left of your stock piles. These are your Spit cards.<br/><br/>How to Play<br/>Together, count down 3, 2, 1, and shout &ldquo;banana!&rdquo; and take the top card from your banana pile and place it face up in the center between you.<br/><br/>As in Spit, play cards in sequence up or down onto the 2 center card piles. Only in this version, play cards from your hands. Play as many cards as possible from your hand and then <br/>draw cards from your stock pile so there are always 5 cards in your hand.<br/><br/>If both of you have 5 cards in your hand and neither of you can play a card, count down from 3, shout &ldquo;banana!&rdquo; and turn the next banana card face up on a center card. Continue <br/>playing.<br/><br/>If your banana pile runs out take a center pile (leaving the top card in the center), shuffle it well, turn the cards face down and start a new banana pile. Continue playing. When your stock pile runs out continue playing cards from your hand without replenishing.<br/><br/>Game End<br/>The first player to play all of their stock pile cards wins.<br/><br/>",

Also included are 5 brand new Sk&aacute;l cards that you can add to your Sk&aacute;l deck (if you have it) and the optional Tipsy card deck.<br/> In addition to the drinking, toasting and fighting of the original Don't fall in the Mead Hall, players now have a chance to sober up (passed out Vikings can wake up) by rolling the feast symbol. Every player will sober up by two (the drunk die will go down two). If you roll the turkey legs symbol your table sobers up by two and you choose another player to sober up by two. Vikings can now bring a sword and shield to the battle mat for a fight to the death. It's double the pain if you roll the new double &quot;Skal!&quot;. Every tables drunk die will go up by two. Watch out because there's a chance Vikings at your table will get into a fight with each other if you roll the double fist. The Tipsy cards (optional, if you want to use them) add some extra mystery to each round and can make the game go faster. At the end of each round flip a Tipsy card and see if one of your Vikings can't hold his own.<br/><br/>The last table with at least one Viking standing wins.<br/><br/>",

        "description": "&quot;Ahh... the Batman. While I have an affection for most flying creatures... the winged rat is not among them.&quot; - The Penguin<br/><br/>Oswald Cobblepot, known as Penguin to most of Gotham, is one of the best villainous businessmen around. If you want a weapon, he has it. Want someone taken care of, he knows the perfect person to call.<br/><br/>Cobblepot started life teased as a child because of his short stature and bird-like nose earning him the nickname 'penguin' and when his father died of pneumonia, his mother made him carry an umbrella wherever he went which did not help with the rest of the worlds view of him. This led to Oswald becoming a nasty, resentful person that wanted to prove he could be better than those around him while he was growing up.<br/><br/>Cobblepot has a genius level intellect, amazing business sense, he's a tactical mastermind, oddly skilled fighter for his build and has obsessions with birds and his trusty umbrellas.<br/><br/>All of this has made him into the Penguin that now runs most of the crime in Gotham.<br/><br/>The Penguin can out-plan and out-think his opponents with ease but if things ever go wrong he has an entire arsenal of trick umbrellas to fall back on. Everything from guns and grapples to gas, hypnosis and even one that can fly.<br/><br/>His plans, schemes and crimes are often run using money from his legitimate businesses like the Iceberg Lounge and Iceberg Casino. If he needs help, he won't shy away from hiring the best in the world but only if he thinks he will come out better off in the end.<br/><br/>In the Batman Miniatures Game, the Penguin crew is all about money, resources and using them as best as you can to get the job done.<br/><br/>Oswald himself much more dangerous than he looks. Armed with an Umbrella Cannon and Umbrella Blade, he can dish out a lot of damage when he needs to and even has a bulletproof vest under his fine jacket for extra protection. He real strength though is getting his crew and others to do the work for him.<br/><br/>Penguin is Charismatic and a Lord of Business so can hire more Free Agents than most, better equip his own men and even take extra Loot Objectives.<br/><br/>The Penguin thugs are cheap but that also makes them numerous. Throw enough men at a problem and it can be solved. The Penguins extra equipment reserves let him arm his hordes well though. Assault Rifles, Automatic Guns and Grenades are not uncommon to see in the middle of the Thugs.<br/><br/>If the hulking Sickle joins him as a Sidekick, he can also bring along some more Elite Penguin Thugs when the extra skill is wanted.<br/><br/>Instead of hordes of Thugs, Penguin also has the options of hiring almost any Free Agent he needs with his Charisma and $$$ letting him choose people like Deadshot and Deathstroke on a regular basis as deadly assassins.<br/><br/>A couple of very good choices though are Catwoman and Mr Freeze. Freeze adds to the ranged threat of the well armed crew while Catwoman can jump around when your opponent is dealing with all the Thugs. Both also have Loot on their mind so the Penguins extra Loot Objective can help you bump up your VPs.<br/><br/>Overall, a Penguin crew is about strength in numbers. Either the number of bodies you have at your disposal or the number of deadly weapons and skilled assassins you throw at your opponent.<br/><br/>A great starting crew with several options and ways to play for the more experienced players.<br/><br/>Contains:<br/>4 metal miniatures:<br/>- Penguin<br/>- Penguin Emperor<br/>- Royal Penguin<br/>- Blue Penguin<br/>Stat cards for the characters<br/><br/>",

        "description": "Lore.<br/>...Your Shieldbearer falls, shield broken and stomach pierced by the Sword of the opposing champion. You move your Archer into the frontline &ndash; Encouraged by your Priestess, he shoots an arrow at the Magician, covered against melee attacks. With an arrow in his chest, he falls. You watch as the Warlord frowns at the result. The loss of his Magician was not part of his plan. Desperately, he orders his Conqueror to battle to face your Monk<br/><br/>With an empowered, overwhelming strike your Monk puts the Conqueror in the grave, exposing the opposing strategist. Rising to the occasion enters your Champion. He charges the Strategist and with a single swing of his sword the Strategist &ndash; The Savages only hope &ndash; is decapitated, securing your victory. Icosara is yours.<br/><br/>Game Concept<br/>Edge Is a tabletop card game where two players wage war on each other using cards, dices and tactical formations. The game has a heavy emphasis on strategy and calculated tactics and plays both like a boardgame and a living card game.<br/><br/>It is very easy to get into the game and the rules seem almost simple, but don't let that fool you. The more you get play it, the more advanced formations you and your opponent will come up with. <br/>Through different tactics and different setups, you will delve into the over 14.000 different ways to set up your army.<br/><br/>Though playing it gives a similar vibe, Edge is not Magic or even a rework of the game. No more arguing about obscure rules or different versions of the same. This game combines elements and inspiration from multiple games, that most gamers will recognize, but the mechanics are utilized in such a way that the game forms it's own new genre.<br/><br/>So choose your tactics and strategy!<br/>How will you choose to play and how will you ensure victory? Do you want to charge at your opponent with brute force, or do you want to slowly lure him into your traps to weaken him before the deathblow. The choice is yours.<br/><br/>Goal of the Game<br/>Most points win!<br/>So in the normal game you will need to accumulate more points then your opponent in a 2 matchs/battles setup.<br/>There are variants but even for those most points win<br/><br/>Resources<br/>This game as stated in the game concept, is about resources. your card/pawns, dices, re-rolls and everything else is a limited resource and you will need to think about when and when not to use them or you will quickly find yourself with any way to protect your army and lose.<br/><br/>",

The rules are available in Japanese and English. (In Japan, the standard deck of Western playing cards is known as a 'Trump' deck. Hence the designer explaining the game as a 'Trump Extension' game.)<br/><br/>Cards numbered A, 2, 3, 4, 5, and two jokers are investment cards. Five cards each are dealt to the players. Cards numbered 6-10 are tax haven cards. Players try to earn positive tax haven cards by playing investing cards.<br/><br/>When you invest on a tax haven card, you place a card stand along a border of the tax haven card and insert an investment card you want to play, so that one player cannot see how much you invest. Up to four players can invest on a tax haven card, and the highest investor earns the face value of that tax haven card. But one pre-determined suit counts negative, and a joker also inverts the sign if involved. You should speculate about hidden cards and try to let negative points go to other investors.<br/><br/>You can co-operate with one of other players by sharing complete information about what you play. But to win the game, you have to part ways in the end.<br/><br/>Jacks, Queens, and King are agent card. Each player has one of these at the beginning of a game, and can use it once for one shot effect, such as reversing order or skipping a player.<br/><br/>Publisher's summary<br/>トランプ拡張ゲーム「パナマ」<br/><br/>トランプ(Playing Card)を<br/>・投資カード　・タックスヘイブンカード　・工作員カード<br/>に分け、場に出されたタックスヘイブンカードの周囲を<br/>投資カードを付属のカードスタンドで立てていき、点数を稼いでいきます。<br/>情報漏洩事務所(Panama paper office)への投資は減点となるため、他人におしつけます。<br/>トランプを立てて置くと、４人の内１人からは必ず絵柄が見えなくなるため<br/>プレイヤーは常に誰を騙すか選択することになります。<br/>協調することで点は増えますが、最終的には出し抜いて１位を目指します。<br/><br/>",

        "description": "The Scrum Card Game supports learners of agile framework SCRUM. Players act in a collaborative team environment during game play. Multiple teams are playing against each other. The objective of the game is that a team of players plan and work on a product's abstract working packages aiming to complete as many working packages as possible. The more functional the product gets the better the players perform in a team. Best team with most functional product wins. Teams with less functional product will lose. A team acts in collaboration while the teams have a competition against each other.<br/><br/>The card deck of the Scrum Card Game consists of four types of cards: <br/><br/>     Story cards describing features the team wants to create for a product,<br/>     Event cards with positive, neutral, or negative impact on game play and progress,<br/>     Problem cards describing permanent obstacles on planned Stories, and<br/>     Solution cards helping players on occurred Problems.<br/><br/><br/>By rolling two dice on each player's turn an amount of working hours per day spent on a working package is determined. This way if a full round (each player finishes an own turn) has finished a working day is simulated. Each three simulated days (which is called a Scrum Sprint) the players replan their work in a agile way. Game ends after three Scrum Sprints.<br/><br/>The card game is used so that players experience work in a simulated SCRUM sprint scenario. It allows reflection of many aspects and topics that happen in real life while working in<br/>a SCRUM team, too.<br/><br/>",

Dinosaurs still roam the Earth &amp; magic actually works! A sub-species of early Humans called Neuro-Evolutionary Rostral Developers (abbreviated as N.E.R.D.s) has recently evolved, &amp; N.E.R.D.s have been busy inventing all sorts of amazing &ldquo;cavepunk&rdquo; stuff.<br/><br/>One of their most popular inventions is the downhill racer, popularly known as the Whee in Cave-Speak. Many different styles of Whees have been invented, &amp; the N.E.R.D.s who invent them almost always claim their design is the best.<br/><br/>A bunch of prehistoric Clans have gotten together to test these claims. The Great Whee Race is about to begin! Each player chooses a Whee Racer, &amp; then purchases a Crew &amp; Cavepunk inventions. The racers then vie to be the first to cross the finish line in a race down a big hill. And just about anything goes in The Great Whee Race, so you&rsquo;ll have to outmaneuver, outfight, &amp; outwit your opponents in order to win!<br/><br/>The Great Whee Race is played on a track overlaid with a square grid. From 2 to 5 racers vie to make it to the finish line first. Each racer - called a Whee in Cave-Speak - is controlled by 1 player (or team of players), A variety of prehistoric-ish species serve as crew members, &amp; give various bonuses. Whees can be outfitted with melee weapons, missile weapons, or both, as well as cavepunk inventions.<br/><br/>Once the downhill journey begins, a simple card-based simultaneous movement &amp; action system is used so that players don&rsquo;t know where anyone else is going when they choose their movement. This has 2 nice effects: players are all active throughout most of each turn, &amp; perhaps more importantly, there are usually LOTS of collisions.<br/><br/>A unique &ldquo;game mechanic&rdquo; is used to resolve all actions: the Rok Draw. Every time they attempt an action or have a contest with another player, a player draws from a pool of tokens consisting of 3 kinds of Roks. Bonuses &amp; penalties add to or subtract from the number of Roks drawn. Most actions have the same target for success, so they are resolved quickly. Players can use 1 of 6 pre-made Whees &amp; crew, or can customize their own using a simple point build system. There&rsquo;s another PDF included with track sections, templates, Whee Racer stat cards &amp; models, &amp; all the tokens you&rsquo;ll need.<br/><br/>",

There are a variety of ways to do that and they can be different each game. You must also complete a personal quest. To win the game at the end of twelve years (three turns per player per year) you must have ten reputation with each of the four kingdoms and every player character must have completed his personal quest.<br/><br/>",

Your reward will depend on what you do, what your opponents do, what you think your opponents will do, what you think your opponents think you will do, etc. etc. At the end of 6 rounds, the player with the most crystals wins.

        "description": "Achievus is a cooperative board game of positive interaction. The game is about achieving a common goal together with an alliance while reviewing and discussing the 17 Success Principles written by Dr. Napoleon Hill (author of the classic book Think and Grow Rich). When the alliance collects more than 2,000 PMA (Positive Mental Attitude) points together they win the game by accomplishing the highest achievement level. If a player in the alliance loses all of his or her 11 Opportunity Time Tokens the game ends for the alliance. As a result, the players compare their alliance&rsquo;s PMA (Positive Mental Attitude) point total with a range of achievement levels.<br/><br/>This Achievus board game base set includes two games in one, &ldquo;Achievus Junior&rdquo; A.K.A. &ldquo;Achievus Mind-Set&rdquo; (2 to 4 players, Ages 7+) and &ldquo;Achievus Original&rdquo; A.K.A. &ldquo;Achievus Challenge&rdquo; (1 to 4 players, Ages 14+). Achievus game includes 112 Cards, 4 Conscious/Subconscious Mind Boards, 4 Golden Rule Applied Tokens, 60 PMA Point Tokens, 44 Opportunity Time Tokens, 2 Token Bags, and the rules for both original and junior game variations.<br/><br/>Achievus Junior &ndash; Game Play Overview<br/><br/>While playing Achievus Junior each player takes a turn in clockwise order to complete a round of play. A player takes his or her turn by following these 5 steps;<br/><br/>Step 1) Draw Step - Draw up to 6 cards, if needed.<br/>Step 2) Call Step - Call out a card to a player for a possible match.<br/>Step 3) Give &amp; Take Step - Give and Take a card with a player.<br/>Step 4) Play Step - May play down any needed pairs for the player&rsquo;s collection of the 17 principles,<br/>Step 5) Redraw Step - Redraw up to 6 cards.<br/><br/>If the players don&rsquo;t have a match during Step 2 then the calling player will lose one of his 11 Opportunity Time Tokens. When it&rsquo;s a match both players add the needed principle card to his or her collection of 17 principle cards. Then they read the principle meaning from the card aloud and discuss it with their alliance. The goal of Achievus Junior is for each player to help one another to collect a card of all 17 principles, without losing all of his or her Opportunity Time Tokens. Only then will the players earn the Golden Rule Applied Tokens, the ultimate achievement of the game.<br/><br/>Achievus Original &ndash; Game Play Overview<br/><br/>While Playing Achievus Original, players will experience prosperity and adversity events throughout the game, earning PMA points and Action Stars. All players&rsquo; follow these 6 consecutive steps together, each step before the next, to complete a round of play.<br/><br/>Step 1) Draw Step - Each player draws five cards, resolving any adversity or prosperity events.<br/>Step 2) Sacrifice Step - Each player may or may not choose to sacrifice his turn, discarding his cards and losing only one Opportunity Time Token this way.<br/>Step 3) Collect Step - Each player may choose to collect the cards they have previously played in their Conscious Mind Section to earn PMA points and Action Stars or may choose to continue gathering without collecting at this time. <br/>Step 4) Play Step - Each player plays his or her cards in consecutive order in any players&rsquo; Conscious Mind Section, earning PMA points for giving.<br/>Step 5) Missed Opportunity Step - Each player loses one of his or her 11 Opportunity Time Tokens for each principle card not played then discards them.<br/>Step 6) Read Step &ndash; Read the top discarded principle card. Players then share aloud how they have applied this principle in his or her life with their alliance.<br/><br/>The goal of Achievus Original is to strategize among the alliance to make the best possible plays. Players need to prepare for Adversity Events that may take away the Principle Cards in a player&rsquo;s Conscious Mind Section. Players work together to gather all 17 Principle Cards in one player&rsquo;s Conscious Mind Section. When this is accomplished, that player collects the cards (During Step 3) which includes all 17 principle cards. Only then will the players earn the Golden Rule Applied Tokens, the ultimate achievement of the game.<br/><br/>",

        "description": "The flagship title of Nailbiter Games, Nailbiter Football is a simulation designed for the solo player.  Instead of resolving a game through an extended play-by-play process, you will experience all the scoring, drama, tension and heartbreak of a pro contest through a series of game highlights and crucial turning points.<br/><br/>The player will compete against a Ghost Coach who calls plays based on a roll on a Play Selection Chart based on down and distance.  There are 14 Offensive plays to choose from, and three special Defensive plays.<br/><br/>The outcome of each possession is determined by cross referencing the roll of two six-sided dice with the appropriate chart.<br/><br/>I've tried this game and Soren Narnia's Coach's Call Football and both are easily modified for a quite realistic representation of the pro football game. In fact, with some modifications they play better and easier than much more costly games that bog down in individual player detail and an over-abundance of charts.<br/><br/>Definitely worth checking out.<br/><br/>",

        "description": "Description from the publisher:<br/><br/>CardFit is a card game that blends exercise and strategy together into one fun, addictive product.<br/><br/>There are two primary modes of play: 1st to 40! and Bid War.<br/><br/>In 1st to 40!, players take turns drawing exercise and repetition cards, then performing the movements that are described on the cards. Starting in the second round, players may begin to use modifier cards, which can do anything from change the exercise, skip a player, increase the amount of repetitions, and even make other people perform additional exercises.<br/><br/>A player earns the number of points listed on the card for successfully completing a round. The first player to earn 40 points, wins.<br/><br/>In Bid War, players divide the repetition cards equally between them and draw 3 modifiers. Each round, an exercise card is drawn. Players then bid by using their rep cards. The highest bid gets to do the exercise for the number of reps they bid. In the case of multiple players bidding the same number, those players may all do the exercise or they can play an additional bid--that additional bid adds to the number of reps that they have already played. After the bidding, players may use modifiers to alter the workout. Players earn the points listed on the card for successfully performing the exercise. The player with the most points after all the rep cards are done, wins! In groups of 4 or more, it is acceptable to reshuffle and re-deal the rep cards once or twice in order to extend play.<br/><br/>CardFit brings friends and family together in a fun and competitive environment while enabling them to exercise at the same time. This game is child friendly<br/><br/>",

        "description": "It began long, long ago (last year), when Sour John moved into our quiet town of Little Worth.  At first all of us were excited, because a silly string store was opening in town, and Sour John&rsquo;s dad was handing out free samples to all the kids in the mall.  We had a blast!  But the spoiled brat &ldquo;Sour John&rdquo;, as we would later come to call him, wasn&rsquo;t satisfied.  He wanted to rule the entire mall, and eventually all of Little Worth.  Sour John was a child genius, and he soon opened his own weapon store, &ldquo;More Gore!&rdquo;, in the mall.  This is where he conducted his late night experiments to perfect a can of silly string that would be unbreakable, unending, AND impossible to resist.  One night he went to the fountain in the greenery section of the mall, &ldquo;Fount Bloom&rdquo;, and discovered that Fount Bloom&rsquo;s special mixture was exactly what was needed to craft his most diabolical creation &ndash; &ldquo;ONE STRING TO RULE THE MALL!&rdquo;<br/><br/>Fortunately for us all, he misplaced The One String before he was able to wield it.  It was found by a good kid, nick-named &ldquo;Seagull&rdquo;, but it quickly corrupted him.  He started using The One String as deodorant and calling it &ldquo;my freshness&rdquo;.  (Yeah, it was weird.)  Seagull took up with the wrong kids, the &ldquo;Redheads&rdquo;, and later changed his name to &ldquo;Gold Thumb&rdquo; (based on his newfound obsession with the James Bond movie &ldquo;Goldfinger&rdquo;).  But again, as fate would have it, &ldquo;Billy Bob&rdquo; Braggin found The One String in Gold Thumb&rsquo;s discarded lunchbox, and he kept it safe for a while.  Most recently he just gifted it to his younger cousin, &ldquo;Fro-Gro&rdquo; Braggin.  But Sour John has just discovered that the Braggin family is in possession of The One String. He has dispatched his scariest goons, the &ldquo;Nostrils&rdquo;, with robes and skateboards of black, to retrieve The One String and bring it back to &ldquo;More Gore!&rdquo;<br/><br/>The two groups of good kids in Little Worth Mall, &ldquo;Yellow Ship&rdquo; and &ldquo;Lean &amp; Green&rdquo;, have just held a secret meeting at &ldquo;Livin&rsquo; Well&rdquo;, a natural supplement store owned by &ldquo;Spell Wand&rsquo;s&rdquo; parents.  They have decided that Yellow Ship will undertake the dangerous task of taking The One String all the way (downstairs) to Fount Bloom, the only place where it can be dissolved forever.  Meanwhile, Lean &amp; Green will serve as a distraction to keep the Redheads and the Nostrils away from The One String.  Secrecy is of the utmost importance.  Each of them grabs their can of silly string and prepares for battle.<br/>The &ldquo;horde of the strings&rdquo; has been set loose in Little Worth Mall!  Who will deploy their forces the most efficiently, and what will become of The One String?<br/><br/>&quot;Horde of the Strings&quot; is a simple game with 42 unique cards representing the characters in the story, 1 map, and 1 rulebook.<br/><br/>OBJECT OF THE GAME:  To draft and then play your cards effectively so that you have as FEW points as possible at the end of the round.  (Normally the lowest score possible would be 0.)  Also, be aware that at the end of the round if one player has BOTH the &ldquo;Sour John&rdquo; and &ldquo;The One String&rdquo; cards in their hand, they get to SUBTRACT 50 points!<br/><br/>",

        "description": "While the instructions say that two or more may play, each player needs 5 cards and there must be a draw pile, so, with 72 cards in the deck, there is a limit in how many may play.<br/><br/>The purpose of the game is to find &quot;units&quot; in your hand. A unit is <br/><br/>    fractions that add up to 1<br/>    percents that add up to 100%<br/>    fractions and percents that together add up to a unit. <br/><br/><br/>Each card can be added either as a fraction or a percent. Some cards give the percent as the larger number, with the fraction as the smaller number, and some do the reverse. Each card also has a circle with a &quot;pie wedge&quot; that shows the given percent/fraction.<br/><br/>The cards are shuffled and each player is dealt five cards. The rest of the cards form the draw pile. The top card is turned face up to form the discard pile.<br/><br/>On their turn, a player takes one card, either from the top of the draw pile or from the top of the discard pile. With their cards, the player tries to make a unit. Each card can be used only once.<br/><br/>If a player finds a unit, they lay it down, face up, and explains how it makes a unit. Then they put the unit into their &quot;unit pile&quot;.<br/><br/>If a player lays down a unit, they draw from the draw pile until they have six cards again (if they did not make a unit, they will have six cards, and will not need to draw).<br/><br/>Lastly, the player discards a card on the discard pile. Then it is the next player's turn.<br/><br/>When all of the cards are gone from the draw pile, the players continue to play as long as they can, drawing from the discard pile only. They cannot fill their hands and do not need to discard.<br/><br/>The winner is the one with the most units in their unit pile. Alternately, the winner may be the one with the greatest number of cards in their unit pile, whichever is agreed upon beforehand by the players.<br/><br/>",

It is not mandatory to play all of them, it is possible to yield the CPU.<br/><br/>3) Take as many operation cards as they have been played in the previous step (they can not be used until the next turn).<br/><br/>The operation cards perform computational operations on the A, B, C and D registers of the CPU.

And which team will be remembered by history? It&rsquo;s all up to you and your friends to decide!<br/><br/>Developers vs Managers is an entertaining / educational board game. The game is designed for IT Specialists by IT Specialists. The purpose of the game is to improve the soft skills of everybody involved. Developers vs Managers is ideal for play when you are on a team building event, having fun in the office or just breaking the ice with new people.<br/><br/>How to play:<br/>First - gather 5 to 10 friends or colleagues<br/>Draw your role and keep it secret until the end of the game! Are you a developer or a manager? The others will judge you by your actions, not just by what you are saying!<br/>Pick-cards<br/>Then: You are the one in charge of who is taking part in the release or not! But you also need to win the trust of the rest of the players that you are leading them to the win...<br/>Pick-a-team<br/>Now vote! The twist of the game is executing the sprint. Is it successful thanks to the effort of the development or management team?<br/>Hint: developers trust only other developers. managers know someone needs to &quot;manage the resources&quot;<br/>If the developers execute 3 successful sprints they win! Unless! The managers guess correctly who the CTO is. Then they win!<br/><br/>The gameplay is extremely addicting because the longer you play, the more you fall into it and the more intense the game gets.<br/><br/>",

Fighting against the clock and the little overlord of chaos, will they manage to have any happiness points by nightfall?<br/><br/>Two parents play one day or 17 hours against one little toddler who moves randomly in the house creating mess each turn.Each hour is one turn in which the parents have to spend action points to move around the house to clean, to do the household chores and toe spend time on 'events', some more chores or unexpected chaos or activities with the toddler, leading to more mess but also to happyness.<br/><br/>The mess arrives in a spot due to an event, a chore not managed or the little toddler moving around. If this is not removed before more mess arrives at the location, it becomes harder to clean and in a next level breaks that location so no chores or events can take place.<br/><br/>A clean house, rest and fun activities give happyness points, a too messy house and not managing the chores leads to less happyness. So both parents have to work together to plan the best schedule, when to be where in the house, who does which activity and who runs after the toddler to balance the keeping the house in order and to score happyness points.<br/><br/>",

Random events affect the players progress, and relics may be gained which will invoke the favour of the gods granting bonus victory points.<br/><br/>However, as a Baggage Train is always on the move, resources are scarce.  You can only use what you can carry with you, and the more you carry, the slower your progress will inevitably be.<br/><br/>The player with the most victory points at the end of the game is the winner  Points are earned for the cargo carried in your baggage train, as well as for having the most scouts or the most saboteurs.  The first player to reach the battlefield is awarded a generous victory point bonus, but this alone will not win you the game.<br/><br/>This is the baggage train, where getting there is half the battle.<br/><br/>",

        "description": "Description from the publisher:<br/><br/>Alamo to Appomattox. A2A is a grand strategy game of the American Civil War in the style of Krieg! Maps of the Eastern and Western Theaters include terrain, Strategic Objectives, roads/rail, naval zones, navigable and non-navigable rivers, cities and locales, supply centers and other features affecting the game. Counters represent the corps and armies of the war. Cards provide the strategic-political-economic direction for each side.<br/><br/>Strategies are many and varied but the ultimate goal is to demoralize the opposing faction&rsquo;s population through military, economic and political victories while sustaining your own population&rsquo;s will to continue the fight. The players each choose a Strategy Card and an Addendum Card before each new season and may opt to play an additional card as a diplomatic response to certain events. These cards lead to new military units, leaders, and replacement steps and result in socio-economic and political events. The events include the declaration of Emancipation, the elections of 1862 and 1864, and the possible intervention by European nations.<br/><br/>Events are often double-edged swords, sometimes providing a military advantage while negatively affecting the popular will to fight. In addition, both sides may attempt to develop and manufacture new technologies, both historical and speculative, such as ironclads, submarines, torpedoes, observation balloons, repeating rifles and Gatling guns. Both sides can introduce espionage and even sabotage, which can have many unexpected consequences, including assassination. Scenarios are included for each year as well as the entire ACW.<br/><br/>Beyond the ACW proper, there are two introductory scenarios: Alamo, a mini-game of the War for Texas and Manifest Destiny, a Mexican-American War mini-game. These short campaigns will give new players an excellent place to start playing and veteran players will have two scenarios that can be finished in an evening. In addition there is Crisis &amp; Compromise, a card play oriented game of the period from the end of the Mexican-American War to the start of the Civil War. Though little combat occurs, the card play covers the actions inspiring events, leaders and regional positions (Border States) that affect the allegiance of states to a region and the ability of military leaders at the start of the Civil War. Crisis &amp; Compromise can be played alone or used to create alternative starting situations for the ACW.<br/><br/>",

        "description": "Description from the publisher:<br/><br/>This is an historical game for three or four players. Each of the eight Rounds represents a long period of northwestern European medieval history, from 20 to 75 years. This game uses a simplified and shortened version of the systems developed for the game Britannia. Each turn, the player moves and attacks with new factions in an effort to score points by achieving that faction&rsquo;s goals.<br/><br/>There are three scenarios, starting in 406 AD (Merovingian Rise), 843 AD (Carolingian Collapse), and 1215 AD (Rise of the Nation-state). The Merovingian Rise scenario follows the barbarian assumption of power from the decrepit West Roman Empire, including the rise of the Merovingian dynasty and the succession of the Carolingian dynasty. It ends with the era of Charlemagne (Charles the Great), the new western Emperor.<br/><br/>The Carolingian Collapse scenario, which chronicles the collapse of the empire built by Charlemagne and his father and grandfather. The scenario begins in 843 AD with the Treaty of Verdun dividing the Frankish empire following the death of Charlemagne&rsquo;s son, emperor Louis &ldquo;the Pious,&rdquo; and ends in 1215, the date of the great Battle of Bouvines.<br/><br/>The three-player Rise of the Nation-State that begins in 1215 is a relatively static situation. Many of the nations can be seen as the precursors of modern states such as Britain, France, Italy, Spain, and Germany.<br/><br/>",

The size of forces on each side are typically a combat command or brigade. Such battles were frequently commanded by Brigadier Generals, hence the name of the rules. Some of the most interesting battles you can play with these rules have a number of commands on each side, each directed by a different player.<br/><br/>These wargame rules were written primarily for play with two or more players, however the rules were specifically designed for the possibility of solo play. Starting from a historical set up, if you play alone, you will find the command rules make it easy to be logical about what orders should be given to each side.<br/><br/>The game includes the rules book, two summary rule sheets, armor penetration table sheet, ready to cut order chits and unit identification markers. Optional extra time and event cards can be purchased separately, which facilitate play and speed the game.<br/><br/>",

        "description": "The purpose of this spin and move vintage space exploration game is to travel to as many planets as possible on the playing board starting at the rocket launching platform spot. The planets are located around the edge of a Monopoly style layout. Each player receives the celestial currency called Celestros upon visiting a planet. Players can encounter setbacks and benefits along the way by landing on specific squares. The game is over when all players return to the Launching Platform. The player with the greatest amount of currency wins the game.<br/><br/>The game has beautiful box graphics typical of the 50s era. The board has the spinner built into it and the playing pieces are colored plastic rockets very similar to that produced by the Lido corporation and seen in the board game Rocket Race to Saturn (1953). Rules are printed on the inside of the box lid and the game was produced by the E-Z game Manufacturing Corporation, New York. Another version of the game is all but identical except the title was changed to 'Race to Planets'.<br/><br/>",

Your future will be bright if you have strong connections with the winning side.<br/><br/>In the game of Tenbin ni Kakero, players secretly vote for one side or two, and when the winning side is determined, a player who has the card with the most influence on that side wins the game.<br/><br/>At beginning of the game, players have several magnate cards and backing cards. Each magnate cards has a different number (1-20) to indicate how much influence that magnate has on which side. Backing cards are either vote card or special cards. Vote cards are numbered 0-3 to indicate vote values, and special cards have a specific power to manipulate votes in play or magnate card in one player's hand.<br/><br/>During your turn, you may place one vote card on one side face down to add some votes, or play one special card for a special effect.<br/><br/>When all backing cards have been played, reveal all vote cards and determine the winning side. The victory goes to the player who has the magnate card with the most influence on the winning side.<br/><br/>Actually, the two sides are not necessarily the republicans and the monarchists.

        "description": "User summary<br/>光と闇と (Hikari to Yami to) in English is 'Light &amp; Darkness'.<br/><br/>In the game of Hikari to Yami to, players play cards to score points, and the highest scorer wins the game.<br/><br/>At the beginning of the game, players have the same number of cards. Each card belongs to one of two sides: light side or dark side, and players' sides are determined by majority of card by side. If you have more light cards than dark cards, your side is the light. You are neutral if you have the same number of cards for both sides.<br/><br/>Players take turns playing a card from their hand, and the card affects all appropriate players written in the text. Most cards refer to the side of players, so you should be conscious of your side. The affected players lose or gain points by the card effect. Then the played card is discarded, which may cause the player to change their side.<br/><br/>The game ends when all players have played all but one card. Apply the remaining card effect only to you, and the highest scorer wins the game.<br/><br/>Publisher's summary<br/>・手札となるカードには「光のカード」と「闇のカード」があります。<br/>・どちらのカードが手札に多いかによって自分の属性が決まります。<br/>・「光のカード」が多ければ、「光の者」です。<br/>・「闇のカード」が多ければ「闇の者」です。<br/>・「光と闇のカードが同数」の場合は「中立の者」となります。<br/>・カードを使用すると効果が発生し、同じ属性のプレイヤーすべてに影響します。<br/>・例えば「光の者」に効果があるカードが使用されると、自分だけでなく他のプレイヤーも含めて、すべての「光の者」に効果が及ぶことになります。<br/>これを繰り返していく、とてもとても簡単なカードゲームです。だけど、ちょっとしたジレンマも発生します。<br/>「自分だけ」に得点を入れようとしても、他の同じ属性のプレイヤーにも得点が入ってしまったり。<br/>他のプレイヤーが何気なく使用した効果で、自分が大きな得点を得たりと、もどかしい感じのゲームになっています。<br/><br/>",

The designer suggests an English title Dessert Buffet!.<br/><br/>In the game of Dessert Buffet!, players are a group of girls who have come to a all-you-can-eat cake buffet. Actually, all of them are on a diet so they don't want to eat too much. That's why they began to foist fattening cakes to one another!<br/><br/>Each player initially has three cake cards. Each turn, you pass a card from your hand to any other player. If it causes that player to have a pair of the same cake, that player has eaten the cake and takes the calories written on the card.<br/><br/>Some cards are special. They can make you or another player gain or lose calories. When you draw such a card, follow the instruction written on it.<br/><br/>At the end of each turn, players with fewer than three cards must fill their hand up to three cards. If that causes a pair, more calories are added as well.<br/><br/>When the draw pile runs out, the player with the lowest calories eaten wins the game.<br/><br/>The game is packaged like a cake, 10cm round and 4cm deep.<br/><br/>Description from the publisher:<br/>プレイヤーはケーキ食べ放題の店にやってきた女子グループになります。<br/>しかし、全員こっそりダイエット中なので、あまりカロリーを摂取したくありません。<br/>手札（皿）にある高カロリーのケーキカードを、他のプレイヤーに押し付けましょう。<br/>同じカードが二枚揃ったプレイヤーはそれを食べたことになり、カードを場に出します。<br/>山札がなくなった時点で一番摂取カロリーの低いプレイヤーが勝者です。<br/><br/>",

        "description": "This mid-1920s game can be used in two ways. The board has six concentric tracks, one per player, each named after a popular radio set or circuit brand: Neutrodyne, Armstrong, De Forest, Crosley, Radiola and Super-H. There also are six D6, marked with the starting letters of the six brands. The board is divided radially into 16 spaces, each with the call letters and city of a major radio station.<br/><br/>The first game is a simple roll-and-move affair. Each player gets a small metal radio horn or &quot;loud speaker&quot;. All the dice are thrown at once, and each player moves ahead as often as his or her starting letter shows up. First player to complete the circuit wins. (This appears to be closely replicating one of All-Fair's top sellers of the period, 1922's Spe-Dem Auto Race Game, which - tellingly - also features a board with parallel colored paths labeled in brand names, as well as an identical method of play.)<br/><br/>The rules booklet also suggests a second game called Toon-In Radio Golf. This requires an actual radio set as well as a copy of the game for each player. Players have to use their radios to try to tune in each of the game's stations in turn, waiting until an announcement of the call letters to verify that he has it right. The first person to successfully tune in all of the stations wins.<br/><br/>The game includes the call letters, city, wavelength and power of each signal. (Even the biggest stations used only 1,000 watt0s!) The rules note that in those days, listening to radio was like golf, with all sorts of hazards like static, amateur transmitters and lightning interfering with clean reception.<br/><br/>",

Being the leader of this cantankerous village is difficult work, best left to someone else. Still, the time has come for a new monarch to be crowned and as the wisest elders still around, one of you will surely become the new person in charge/scapegoat to blame for all the kingdom's problems. To decide who will ascend to this awesome responsibility, you'll present the accoutrements of power to your opponents hoping to ensnare one of them (ANY OF THEM!) with all five: the ring, the robe, the sceptre, the crown and the throne. Be careful! Each item given to another player also gives them a powerful advantage in a future turn. If they survive the round, revenge will come swift and hard.<br/><br/>Every round, each player presents one gift of power to another and then in turn, each player can assert the powers granted by their previously acquired artifacts. These powers can refuse gifts, trade them, introduce new ones or shuffle them around. When a player is bestowed the fifth item in the set and is unable to avoid accepting it, they become king and the player who gave them that item becomes the kingmaker and wins the game.<br/><br/>",

These people were given outdated firearms, and were forced to kill one another. There were two reasons for the Government to do this: one was to collect battle data through the experimental battles, and the other was as an easy way to dispose such troublesome people.<br/><br/>Dokugasu Zangousen is a three-dimensional chess-like board game. In a 7x7 square grid board, you may make a hump (place a cube) or dig an entrenchment (remove a cube) to avoid lines of fire or to hinder enemy's movement. But entrenchment is vulnerable to poison gas which tends to go downward into holes.<br/><br/>Players initially have two soldiers each. At the beginning of each round, players place two action cards face-down in front of them. Then first player takes all actions they have placed.<br/><br/>During your turn, you may do two of the following  actions as you have programmed:<br/>1) Move: Move one of your soldiers one square orthogonally, or advance the soldier two squares forward.<br/><br/>2) Turn: Turn the direction of one of your soldiers.<br/><br/>3) Construct: Place a cube on a square adjacent to one of your soldiers. Or remove a cube from in front of the soldier.<br/><br/>4) Fire: Fire a gun from one of your soldiers orthogonally to kill an enemy or destroy a cube. Or throw a bag of poison gas to kill soldiers within an affected area, which is determined by wind direction.<br/><br/>5) Dig: Dig an entrenchment at the exact square of one of your soldiers.<br/><br/>6) Item: One of your soldier wears or takes off a gas mask. While wearing the mask, the soldier gains protection from poison but is unable to advance two squares, construct, or move cubes. Or one of your soldier takes a drug for two extra actions.<br/><br/>7) Camp: Retrieve one or all action cards you have played so far.<br/><br/>You score one point when you kill one of your enemies, or when you move one of your soldier outside the board across the opponent's border.

        "description": "Description from the publisher:<br/><br/>Objectives: Vietnam is a cooperative, competative card game for one to six people where players compete against the game to take objectives by battling the NVA forces.<br/><br/>The cards<br/><br/>Objectives: Vietnam runs with three decks of cards. The first deck is the Objectives deck. These cards are places and events that the players must collect before they accumulate in the &ldquo;War Weariness&rdquo; pool. Objectives are guarded by a number of NVA cards as designated by the NVA score on the Objective card. Each Objective card also has a Value. This is the number of points the players receive when they take the objective. NVA cards are the second deck and represent the North Vietnam Army. These cards come in different strengths and have varying abilities. The last deck is the Free World deck. These cards are dealt to the players face down and represent the resources they have to take objectives and affect the War Weariness pool. Players may not share or expose their hands to other players during the course of the game.<br/><br/>Setup<br/><br/>Shuffle each deck separately and then deal out a number of Free World cards face down to each player as determined by figure 1 (Number of players). Play starts with the player to the left of the dealer and moves clockwise around the table.<br/><br/>Sequence of play<br/><br/>When a players turn starts they draw one Free World card. If the player has less than their starting hand in Free World cards they draw up to their starting card total instead. Once the player has drawn their cards, the top Objectives card is turned over and placed in the middle of the playing field. This is mandatory and will always happen each players turn. This is the War Weariness pool. The player now has the option of attempting to take the objective (see combat) or take an additional Free World card and pass his turn to the player to his left. If you do nothing in your turn you can always draw one Free World card and this can bring your total cards above your starting hand size. There is no upper limit on the number of cards you can have in your hand.<br/><br/>Combat<br/><br/>When a player decides they are going to take an objective they deal out a number of NVA cards equal to the NVA score on the Objective card face down. Starting with the attacking player, each player &ldquo;bids&rdquo; the cards they will use in the attack by placing them face down in front of themselves. Once all players have bid their cards, the player cards are revealed and then the first NVA card in line is revealed. Add up the strength value of all exposed NVA cards each reveal phase and compare it to the total of the Free World card strength. If the NVA total is double the total strength of all the exposed Free World bid cards, the objective is overrun and lost (See losing combat). If the total is not double the attackers strength and there are more NVA cards to be revealed, the players go around again bidding more cards for the next reveal phase. This continues until all NVA cards involved in the battle are face up. If the attacking players have a higher total Strength than the strength total of all NVA cards in play then they win the objective and it is placed to the side. If there are four or more players, the attacking player now draws a number of Free World cards equal to the NVA value on the Objective that was just secured and can now give them to the other players as reinforcements. The player may only keep one card for himself and he may not look at any of the cards being distributed. This may take the player over his starting hand limit. He may then attempt to take another objective or end his turn. If an attack is declared and the players feel they can&rsquo;t take the objective they can call off the attack but the player that called the attack must discard his entire hand and his turn ends. The objective is treated as if the players lost combat.<br/><br/>Losing combat<br/><br/>Should the players be defeated by the NVA, the objective is placed back in the War Weariness pool and a token is placed on the card. Objectives that have tokens on them add one to the NVA value for each token on the card. This is cumulative with any other effect in the game<br/><br/>War weariness<br/><br/>As the game progresses, cards will begin to build up in the War Weariness pool. The more cards in the War Weariness pool the more difficult it will be to take objectives. Starting with the third card in the War Weariness pool, add one to the NVA score for every Objective card. Once you have six cards in the War Weariness pool you add one more and finally when there is nine cards in the War Weariness pool you add one more for a total of +3 to the NVA score on all Objective cards. If a duplicate Objective card is added to the War Weariness pool it is shuffled back in to the deck and a token is added to the original card in the War Weariness pool instead.<br/><br/>Ending the game<br/><br/>If there are 10 cards in the War Weariness pool at the end of any players turn the game wins. The players win if they accumulate a total of ten points per player, 15 in a single player game. (IE a 4 player game needs to get 40 points in Objectives). The player that initiates the attack keeps the points of the objective if the players win the objective. The player with the most points when the players win is deemed the winner of the game. Note that if the game wins, no one wins.<br/><br/>",

Through these innovative and easy-to-play games players master important information about the political and physical geography of the world.  A valuable experience for young and old, novice or expert.  Learningames are unique, informative, and always enjoyable.<br/><br/>Overview of play<br/><br/>Two to six players sit around the Map Playing Board.  The map may include political centers and/or geographical areas.  In place of the names of the political centers (including cities, states, and nations) and geographical areas (including physical features, regions, and cultural and economic centers) normally found on the map are numbers 1-50.<br/>To begin the game a player draws a Card form the deck.  Each card has the name of a political center or geographical area on one side (Side &ldquo;A&rdquo; with the blue background) and a number with important information about the named center or area on the other side (Side &ldquo;B&rdquo; with the white background).<br/>In the Basic Game players win cards by locating and naming different political centers or a geographical area on the numbered playing board or by correctly challenging incorrect answers.  When playing the Advanced Games, players master important information about the political centers and geographical areas identified in the basic games.  Players always find Learningames fun, and best of all, they learn about the world around them.<br/><br/>",

        "description": "This is a very unusual Japanese travel game published by the Osaka Mainichi newspaper in 1926 (Taisho 15), quite unlike the typical Mawari-Sugoroku board, which has a path of pictures spiralling toward the center.<br/><br/>This game is a huge map of the world surrounded by flags. It measures about 43&quot; tall and 30&quot; wide. It is oriented (no pun intended) toward the East at the top, with North to the left, South to the right and West downwards. Japan is centered in the upper half, with the Pacific and Americas above it, Australia to the right, Asia/India in the middle and Europe/Africa at the bottom.<br/><br/>The map shows a wide variety of destinations linked by numbered routes. Each player starts from Japan and travels in the direction indicated by a die roll (with a 6 going nowhere). The objective is to reach London by travelling either east or west, with North America at the top connecting to European/African destinations at the bottom.<br/><br/>The period illustrations are wonderful, including a bust of Lenin in Leningrad (with a train heading back to Germany), Charlie Chaplin being filmed as the little tramp in Hollywood, a cannibal eating a white man in Indonesia, a hookah-smoking Turk, a kilted Scot, an arrogant European waiter, a Dutch girl in clogs and a Spaniard fighting a bull. There also are drawings of all the famous sights, from Niagara Falls, the Taj Mahal and the Pyramids to the Kremlin, Statue of Liberty, Westminster, and a biplane flying over the Eiffel Tower.<br/><br/>",

Helpful trolls blunder about, collecting up the cheese to replenish the faeries' cheese stock, but also impede their faerie friends' progress.<br/><br/>The game comprises a leather board (11 x 5.5&rdquo;) and hand-finished wooden pieces; with plastic dice. Each player has six faeries, one troll and six wedges of cheese. In a turn a player rolls four dice - one pink, one green and two yellow. Using the number rolled on the pink die, the player moves a faerie towards the middle safe line on the board. With the green die the player moves the troll, who can pick up cheese that has been thrown by the opposing player. Using the two numbers rolled on the yellow dice as co-ordinates, the player &lsquo;throws&rsquo; cheese into their opponent's half of the board. Any faerie this lands on is eliminated from the game; cheese also blocks the movement of faeries towards the safe line.<br/><br/>Each player aims to move as many of their own faeries as possible to the central line and off the board, while eliminating or blocking the movement of their opponent's faeries by throwing cheese at them. The winner is the player who, once one player has no more faeries to move, has most faeries safe. If the result is tied, numbers of remaining faeries and cheese on the board can determine the winner.<br/><br/>",

It also requires that a number of air counters be made/modified to show the different sizes of air units used (squadron/staffel, wing/gruppe, group/geschwader) and base units. Battle of Britain simulates the air war over England and the attempt by the Luftwaffe to prepare for the possible invasion of England (Operation Seeloewe) in the late summer of 1940. It involves air combat only and is therefore suitable for assimilation of the unofficial 'Bro'Air Rules, which differs considerably from the originals.

        "description": "This is a very large and unusually sophisticated electric football game that appears from the photos on the box and rules to date from the early to mid-1960s. It uses metal player pieces that are inserted into holes on the board both to set a hidden defensive formation and to run offensive plays.<br/><br/>Behind a cardboard shield, the defensive player places 11 men into his choice of the 29 holes on the defensive side of the playing surface. These are arranged in 7 lines: Deep Back (3), Back (5), Quarterback (3), Scrimmage (7), Beyond (3), Short Pass (5) and Long Pass (3).<br/><br/>The offensive player then decides both on the play and a risk factor (that adds to both gains and losses). He then inserts a man into appropriate holes, one at a time. A Backfield Run must start in a Fullback or Half-back hole, then either Deep Back or Scrimmage, then Beyond. A QB Sneak starts at the QB hole, then to Scrimmage, then to Beyond and to a Breakaway hole. For a pass, the QB starts in his own hole, then to Deep Back, and to any hole in either the Short or Long Pass lines.<br/><br/>In essence, the offensive player is trying to guess where the defending players are and navigate a path through them. If there is no defensive player in the hole he uses, he carries on to a hole of his choice in the next line for the play; if there is, a red light goes on and the play ends, with the results coming up on an electric spinner and multiplied by the risk factor table. If he reaches the breakaway hole, a green light comes on, leading to a big gain.<br/><br/>The game thus enables the defense to be shaped for any situation, from guarding against a long pass to running a blitz by placing a defensive player in the QB hole and/or one or more Deep Back holes.<br/><br/>There are rules for tracking time, using time-outs, and penalties (for instance, when the offense uses an illegal sequence like QB - Scrimmage - Long Pass). The positions of the football and the 10-yard sticks are marked on a strip running along one side of the playing field.<br/><br/>",

Mongolia is the only other nation in the game. It starts as a neutral that may be invaded--and thereby brought actively into play--by either Russia or China.<br/><br/>This isn't a simulation of the &quot;opaque&quot; or &quot;gray war&quot; techniques recently used by the Russians in the Crimea and eastern Ukraine and by the Chinese in the South China Sea. Rather, it's designed to facilitate the examination of the strategic possibilities inherent in this potentially much larger and more violent situation.<br/><br/>The potential conflict being modeled here, though its possibility isn't yet discussed much in the border media, might best be thought of as the &quot;war after next.&quot; That is, with the Chinese efforts to push into the Western Pacific and Indian Ocean being increasingly blocked by new alliance structures, and the &quot;New Silk Road&quot; across Central Asia being inescapably long and therefore vulnerable, Beijing has only one more direction in which to go to secure the natural resources needed for its hungry economy: north to Siberia.<br/><br/>Such a strategy has two inherent advantages for the Chinese. First, Siberia is relatively close by and, once secured, the resources extracted from it need not be shipped overseas in order to get them to Chinese factories. Second, Putin's foreign policy adventurism has left Russia with no friends other than Iran--so no other country would be likely to come to his aid.<br/><br/>Of course, there's one major disadvantage in a Siberian strategy. That is, Russia, like China, is a major nuclear power, with all the danger for a potential holocaust that implies.<br/><br/>Each full turn represents two months of real time. Each hexagon on the map represents 37.25 miles (60 km) from side to opposite side.<br/><br/>",

        "description": "This is a lavishly illustrated German roll-and-move game from early in WWI that, possibly for the first time ever, showed the emerging role of aviation in naval warfare.<br/><br/>The overall narrative of the 90 space inward spiral track is of navies grappling to find one another, with ships firing and sinking, distressed sailors being rescued, and even a school of fish watching a U-boat launching its &quot;fish&quot; underwater, all culminating in a furious central battle scene.<br/><br/>However, there are six panels showing aircraft in a reconnaissance role. Two of these are Zeppelin-style rigid airships, one is a somewhat Bleriot-like two-seat monoplane, and the remaining three are early seaplanes with floats.<br/><br/>The game board has no indication of the game's actual title, publisher or date. However, the seaplane pictures include one that appears to be a Friedrichshafen FF33, which had a unique tail shaped like a fletched arrow, and which first flew in 1914. Since this looks like the most modern aircraft shown, the game was probably published in 1915.<br/><br/>",

The series is set in 1985, in an alternate history of World War III. With the Warsaw Pact armies driving deep into Western Europe, the Soviets open another front in the Arctic Circle. Sweden, Norway and - in an unexpected and lightning strike - Iceland are invaded. Surprised by Polish and Soviet marine and parachute forces reinforced by ship-bourne Polish and Soviet armor, the Scandanavian and NATO/Icelandic defenders are hard-pressed.<br/> The World at War 85 system features a unique combat system that involves die rolls by both attacking units and defending units, which keeps both players engaged throughout the game. Die rolls are compared and hits applied quickly, as all the information you need to fight your units is on the counters. No combat results table is necessary. Initiative, formation activation, random turn length, close air support and air cover are all smoothly integrated.<br/> It&rsquo;s all here:<br/><br/><br/>     Basic, Advanced and, for each Volume, Optional Rules.<br/><br/><br/><br/>     Units include:<br/>         SWEDISH STRV-103 and Centurion Main Battle Tanks<br/>         SWEDISH JA-37 Viggen Close Air Support Aircraft<br/>         NORWEGIAN Leopard 1-A1 Main Battle Tank<br/>         NORWEGIAN F-104G Starfighter Air Cover Aircraft<br/>         US MARINE (of the ICELANDIC DEFENSE FORCE) M-60 Main Battle Tank<br/>         US F-15 Eagle Air Cover Aircraft<br/>         POLISH T-62 and T-72 Main Battle Tanks<br/>         POLISH MIG-23 Air Cover Aircraft<br/>         SOVIET T-64 Main Battle Tank<br/>         SOVIET MIG-25 Air Cover Aircraft<br/>         &hellip;and many more.<br/>    <br/><br/><br/>",

Then, players will take turns to define 15 of Van Gogh's erratic movements. Each round, one of the players will play secretly so the other players won't know for sure where Van Gogh is located.<br/><br/>Players can get points if Van Gogh passes through one of their Food Stands or if Van Gogh wavelike movement matches one of the Path Cards that the players have. If Van Gogh would leave the table, players may lose points.<br/><br/>The game ends after each player had the chance to play secretly during a round. The player with the most points wins.<br/><br/>",

Working together as a team, players must stabilize the global populations of amphibians, birds, mammals, and reptiles before time runs out or the damage done to the planet&rsquo;s biodiversity is beyond repair.<br/><br/>Using unique character skills, combined with team strategy and a bit of luck, players travel the globe encountering real-world destruction events and conservation strategies as they try to bring an end to the worldwide Extinction Crisis. The overall health of the global animal populations is tracked on the Population Growth Index (PGI) chart on the board. For victory, each animal population must be &ldquo;stabilized&rdquo; by raising its PGI marker above the zero value. The primary method to do this is for a player to successfully complete a Reaction card during their turn. These scientifically accurate cards are a major determining factor towards the team&rsquo;s overall success.<br/><br/>However, at the start of each player&rsquo;s turn an Occurrence Card is drawn. These cards guide the story and introduce real-world events and challenges that must be overcome. But be careful&hellip; Just when you think you&rsquo;re in the clear you could be hit with a Destruction Event, causing an entire species to become endangered or a local habitat to be destroyed. Other actions allow players to meet these challenges and progress towards their final objective. Players must also pay attention to the health of the world&rsquo;s waterways, invertebrates, and plants. Neglect any of the 3 main charts (PGI, IP, and Ocean) for too long and the consequences could be disastrous: a smart team balances the needs of all 3 charts continuously throughout the game to achieve victory.<br/><br/>Extinction Crisis presents players with a daunting task and requires them to find solutions, adapt to challenges, and overcome the very real crisis facing the planet.  With only 10 turns each, how will you rise to the occasion?<br/><br/>",

Each agent receives an Alignment card, a point tracker card and 8 code cards. (The same 8 code cards are given to each agent.) After examining their code cards, each agent will choose one to discard. The other 7 form a player's hand, though only 6 of these will come into play.<br/><br/>Agents activate their cards simultaneously. Some have repercussions or rewards if other agents activate the same card simultaneously. In addition to scoring points for your agent team, you may attempt to eliminate opposing agents, though there is also a chance of eliminating team mates. In the end, remaining agents on a team will add their victory points. The highest scoring agency wins.<br/><br/>",

You must stay on that space every turn until you throw a 6 which boosts your engine power and allows you to carry on with your journey. If you land on a black space, this represents extra power by the Black Hole and you must return to the Start space and start again on your next turn.

Oh, and also drinking and gambling.<br/><br/>We present, for your entertainment, a new sort of party game for adults. Fair warning, though, it contains drinking, racing, expenditure of petty cash, and all manner of chicanery. Have you ever wondered if you were the fastest thigh-poker around? Are you confident that you could portray the most convincing withered crone? Do you excel at eloquence while inebriated? Want to win money from your friends? Do you enjoy judging the wit and skills of your peers? If you answered affirmatively to any of these, Hissy Fit is the game for you!<br/><br/>Oh, and it also pays for itself the first time that you win, provided you play for real money. Now that's value!<br/><br/>A game of Hissy Fit consists of players dividing into teams and competing against each other in bizarre and humorous challenges. These can be anything from &ldquo;First person to reach the Great Outdoors&rdquo; to &ldquo;Best Impromptu Facial Hair&rdquo; to the dreaded &ldquo;Slurgeon General&rdquo;, where a player will be forced to navigate a tricky tongue twister. After judgement is passed, losing players pay a dollar in tribute, and the winner flips their coin to determine how the drinks are administered. If they&rsquo;re lucky, all the losers will drink, but if fortune turns against them, they drink instead. After much competition, the besotted winner gets a huge pile of cash, and the losers go home happy.<br/><br/>What's with the name? Well, in Hissy Fit, outbursts of laughter are both constant and contagious. Naturally,we decided to reward and punish it simultaneously. When the Hissy Fit token is invoked, all laughter is forbidden and only good-humored hissing is permitted. This effect persists only until someone screws up, but it is truly a sight to behold. As it happens, trying not to laugh is in fact more hilarious than just laughing, and the copious hissing adds tremendously to the fun.<br/><br/>It's a game that pits subjectivity against objectivity in winners. Want to win a &quot;Best&quot; challenge? You'll have to convince the judge of your superiority. Want to win a &quot;First&quot; challenge? Well, the only things standing in your way are your own limitations. It's truly the best of both worlds!<br/><br/>",

        "description": "User summary<br/>PORTAS is a two-player card game with a theme of treasure hunting. Players are competing treasure hunters, and at beginning of the game, each player has the same deck of cards, and each card is numbered 1-6. Two treasure cards (valued 11-15) are revealed on the table.<br/><br/>Players take turns placing a card from their hand on either of the treasure cards revealed. When the total value of the cards placed on the treasure equals to the treasure value, the current player takes the treasure and scores points. Then a new treasure comes on the table.<br/><br/>All cards in players' hands are public information except the one they would draw at the beginning of their turn. So you should play cards so that your rival doesn't take a treasure next turn, but sometimes you are forced to play a bad card, and there's some chance the rival would draw the exact card they want.<br/><br/>The game ends when all treasures are taken or both players passes in a row. The highest scorer wins the game.<br/><br/>As long as a child can count to 15, the game is easy enough for the young. The game uses original art and public domain artwork.<br/><br/>Publisher's summary<br/>PORTAS （読み方は「ポータス」。造語。日本語でも英語でも同じです。）<br/><br/>二人のプレイヤーはトレジャーハンターとなり、宝箱に眠る宝を取り合います。<br/>宝箱の底には魔法の鍵があり、宝はその鍵を手に入れないと数分の内に消えてしまうのです。<br/>宝箱の中身の残りの数を考えて、「丁度最後の一個を手に入れる」事を計算しながらより多くの宝を手に入れるのが目的のゲームです。<br/>バケツやバッグ、木箱等の入れ物を使い宝を自分のもとに運び出します。その中で最後の一個である「鍵」を自分が手に入れられるように、計算をしましょう。<br/>相手の手札（バッグなどの入れ物）は全て公開情報です。明かされた情報と、そこから少しだけ絡んでくる運。そして先を読む頭脳で戦うシンプルな「足し算」ゲームです。<br/><br/>",

When his lithe fingers strum its strings as he has done for many decades, using the sweet sound and combining it with his deep voice to create powerful prayers, Shomyos.

        "description": "Description from the publisher:<br/><br/>Like all monks of the Temple of Ro-Kan, Seiji is following a path and element that he was always destined to. Still in the early years of his training this calm and relaxed monk is already showing signs that he will become a great defender of the Jwar Isles, and an asset in the struggle against the chaos. It is told that Seiji sat under the Grand Father tree for a full cycle in meditation, quietly becoming as one with the forest around him and in a deep communion with the sacred Kami. The secrets he learned now enable Seiji to seek out the help of the natural world around him, it comes to his and the Temple&rsquo;s aid. Enemies find themselves rooted to the spot, held firm as they are bound and restrained by the very ground itself. Along with this ability Seiji has also achieved a higher level of understanding and attunement with his own body, enabling him to focus his energies and recover from even the most severe of wounds at an astounding rate.<br/><br/>",

Points are the number of cards in each player's hand plus 'It's Not Your Turn' cards. <br/>     Players take turns either playing the correct card from their hand (if they have it) face-up, playing a card face-down in an attempt to either bluff or reverse-bluff, or being honest about not having the right card and taking a 'It's Not Your Turn' card. Players can even use a house rule where they can try to steal another player's turn(s) by playing certain number cards at the right moment.<br/>     The game has a lighthearted spoof theme of the stereotypical gamer elitist as shown on the different suit cards and on the game box.<br/><br/><br/>",

To look at them individually one would think that they lack any combat skill, but once combined, one astride the other, the pair are a tricky opponent.

With some luck, and a bit of strategy of how you maneuver through your guild of cards that you burn haven cards to gain better hands, you must avoid burning too many of your haven cards or you instantly lose. Some players take risks, some play conservatively, if you have a good stride with your style it may work for you depending on the player you play against or it may fail you every time.<br/><br/>There are other strategies to win the game that may deplete your opponents coins disabling them from playing effective card combinations to win or playing your hand right forcing your opponent to burn a lot of haven cards. The tone switches drastically from a contemplative 2 player game to a very social 4 player game of banter and psyching as players trade cards and manage wins without doubt of winning the game.<br/><br/>",

What is certain is that when Yukio speaks, he speaks with the authority of the emperor and whether he is questioning a samurai&rsquo;s honour, chastising an underling or barking orders, he cannot be dis-obeyed. Yukio is a representative of the Imperial Court and can issue a decree in their name should those in his presence displease him.

        "description": "Dash Through the Dungeon is a fast-paced game of dungeon exploration for 2-6 players ages 6 and up. Each player takes on the role of a brave adventurer, making their way through a series of dark dungeons. Your goal is to find treasure while avoiding creatures and other obstacles, like traps and locked doors. You&rsquo;ll have some help along the way in the form of useful equipment and beneficial encounters.<br/><br/>Contents:<br/><br/>60 Dungeon Cards<br/><br/>21 Equipment Cards<br/><br/>Set Up:<br/><br/>First step is to separate the Dungeon Cards and Equipment Cards into two decks and give them both a good shuffle. Next take the Dungeon Cards and deal out the first dungeon, laying 20 cards out face down in a 4 x 5 grid. This will be the first dungeon that the players will take turns exploring.<br/><br/>Next deal out three equipment cards at random to each player. This is your starting equipment. Players are free to look at these cards. You can place them either face up or face down on the table in front of you. Playing with them face down adds a bit of additional suspense to the game since other players won&rsquo;t know if you have the equipment needed to get past a particular encounter until you reveal it.<br/><br/>Now you&rsquo;re ready to play.<br/><br/>Taking a Turn:<br/><br/>The game is played in a series of turns. A player starts their turn with 6 action points or APs. Once its decided who goes first, players one begins their dash through the dungeon. They select and flip over any card on the 5 X 5 dungeon grid, then subtract the AP cost of that card from their remaining APs. In some cases, like flipping over the Pit Trap, the card may tell you that you must &ldquo;lose all remaining AP and end turn&rdquo; which means you&rsquo;re turn is done. Some equipment cards, like the Float-Up Potion, can be used to cancel out these cards. A card that&rsquo;s canceled in this way costs 0 AP. Some equipment cards can also be used to reduce the AP cost of certain cards, like Bandage, or even reduce them to 0, like Freeze Bomb. Your turn ends when your AP reaches 0 or you flip over a Treasure. When your turn ends you take any cards you flipped over, keeping Treasure cards separate from the other dungeon cards.<br/><br/>Then it&rsquo;s the next player&rsquo;s turn to explore. Players continue until all the cards of the first dungeon have been flipped over. When the last card is flipped, the AP of the player who flipped it is reduced to 0 and their turn ends.<br/><br/>Another 4 X 5 grid of Dungeon Cards are then laid out and the next player&rsquo;s turn begins. Play continues in this order until a total of three dungeons have been explored.<br/><br/>Winning the Game:<br/><br/>Once all three dungeons have been explored players add up the value of their treasure cards. They then count up all the other Dungeon Cards they&rsquo;ve collected and add the amount to the value of their treasure cards. Whoever has the most points wins.<br/><br/>",

        "description": "Description from the publisher:<br/><br/>Sexy Ninja Death Squad (or SNDS for short) is a fast fire card game designed for 2+ players than can last from 15-25 minutes. Players furiously attack each other and defend themselves in order to be the last ninja standing. Each card can be used in attack or defence and placed in the Head, Body or Legs position depending on it's tabs. There is an Active Character Token (or A.C.T.) which signifies the active player. On receiving this you draw one card and can play one card on the players sitting next to you. They then have to block this attack with a card of their own OR give you a hit token (you have 3 of these in the standard game). When you lose a hit token you recharge your hand back up to 5 cards. Lose all 3 and you are defeated.<br/><br/>There are three special indicators which can appear on the cards and these signify 'Flurry', 'Riposte' or 'Ninja Star' cards. When a Flurry card is played in an attack you immediately draw another card and can play another attack card. If another Flurry card is played then you draw and play another attack and so on...<br/><br/>When a Riposte is played in a defence you immediately draw another card and can play an attack card on the player your attacker. If a Flurry card is played then its free second attack can hit any valid player.<br/><br/>The third type of card is the Ninja Star which can attack anyone.<br/><br/>Flurry and Riposte cards chain without limit which means your games get very hectic very quickly. The more people who are playing the more fun it becomes because more players means more ACTs!<br/><br/>It is not uncommon for other players to attempt to kill steal by lobbing a ninja star across the table, or you having to change tactics when your carefully prepared Flurry chain gets blocked and you have Riposte attacks to survive. Sometimes it is better to take the damage, lose a hit token, recharge your hand and come out swinging.<br/><br/>",

When you sit down to play, you pick a case to attempt, some are for beginners while others challenge even the most experienced players.<br/><br/>During your turn you must prioritise either gathering clues, following up leads or hunting out information. Working together is important, as there is limited time to find and arrest the guilty before they escape and you lose. After you&rsquo;ve finished your turn, a story card is drawn.

During their first night in the house Claire wakes to find James missing. As she searches for him she begins to realize the house is haunted, but luckily the spirits are not all bent on doing harm. The ghosts of her ancestors are there to whisper into her ear the dangers that lie ahead so she that may avoid them and find James.<br/><br/>House of Whispers is a cooperative game in which one person plays Claire and the rest play the friendly spirits. As a spirit, communicate what information you can to Claire. As Claire, you must make the right decisions to avoid the terrors of the house and save your little brother!<br/><br/>At the beginning of the game all players choose one word. The spirits communicate to Claire with facial expressions and by saying their word in such a way to communicate any information they can about the cards they draw. For example, if your word is &quot;beware&quot; and you draw a zombie, you might say &quot;beeewwaarrre&quot; in a slow grating voice while rolling your eyes and fixing a dead stare on your face. Claire may then decide if she wants to run from this threat or push on and try to deal with it as she searches for James.<br/><br/>Search the house for clues as to James' whereabouts and discover items that may help you locate him. You must save James before 8 rounds are up, otherwise he will be lost to the house forever.<br/><br/>",

In fact, depending on the customer, the grosser the better.<br/><br/>Grossburgers is a real time dice rolling game about building and selling burgers.  Players, at the same time, roll their dice trying to get sets of icons to do different actions in the game.  When one player has an action that requires them to ring the bell, everyone must pause play and let them perform their action.  Then that player rings the bell and everyone can start <br/>rolling their dice and performing actions again.<br/><br/>Players will fulfill customer orders with ingredients ranging from classic to grossout!  Ingredients on burgers are worth points at the end of the game but watch out for grossouts because they will cause you to score negative points.<br/><br/>Grossburgers is a fast and frenzied game of burger building madness!<br/><br/><br/>",

After each roll, the rolling player may choose to use one rolled special ability to affect the roll results or damage the Killer Die. They then remove any eliminated victim dice from the game. The player then rolls again until they either complete five rolls, run out of victim dice, or chase off the Killer Die by dealing at least 5 damage.<br/><br/>How you win:<br/>After each player has taken their turn of five rolls, the player with the most surviving victim dice is declared the winner. In case of a tie, the player who also dealt the most damage to the Killer Die wins. If no player has any surviving dice, the Killer Die wins.<br/><br/>",

This is a simple game, and you don't have to know anything about or even care about politics to enjoy this game.<br/><br/>The game starts with a wall half built (or half destroyed if you will). If all the bricks are in place - team orange wins. If all the bricks are gone - team green wins.<br/><br/>The bricks are added or removed after every round, depending on which team wins. The card values are added together and if the score is above zero 0 the green team wins and removes a brick. If not - the orange team does and adds one.<br/><br/>",

Contracts come in for freight and passengers every morning starting at 5am.  Trains need to be loaded and out of here by 5:30.  You have exactly 30 mins to complete your tasks.  It is YOUR job to see that ALL contracts are fulfilled.  GOT IT?!?&rdquo;<br/><br/>&ldquo;More than that, make sure you make the railyard money or you are sacked!  Every locomotive, and car you use needs to be fully loaded, or it will cost you your job.  And one more thing, don&rsquo;t overload my trains.  Locomotives can only pull so much.  You blow one of my engines and I will become seriously unpleasant.&rdquo;<br/><br/>&ldquo;Any questions?&rdquo;<br/><br/>&quot;No?&quot;<br/><br/>&ldquo;Excellent&quot;<br/><br/>&ldquo;One more thing to remember, as departure time draws nearer and you see you don&rsquo;t have enough capacity to fill all your contracts, you can always sub them out to one of these mates standing next to you.  You may not get paid for that contract, but it won't count against you when the whistle blows.  You and I get paid when the contracts get filled so make sure there are no contracts in your hand when the whistle blows.&ldquo;<br/><br/>&ldquo;Now get out there and make me some money!&rdquo;<br/><br/>Gameplay is as follow:<br/>Players start with 10 train cards.  Each turn they can either draw 3 cards or play 3 cards.  In order to play cards, you must first play a locomotive and coal car.  Then additional car and cargo can be played.  The correct train car needs to be played in order to place cargo and cargo is the only way to make money.  In the end, if time and running out and there is cargo you cant play, then subcontract it onto another player's train.  You may not get the money for it, but it wont cost you double in the end.  You also might just fill a spot on an opponent's train that they needed.<br/><br/>",

Players agree on the size of each army made up of urban guerillas (typical scenario calls for any guerilla troop of five to eleven guerillas, though enough tokens are available to field 18 guerillas per side). Players also agree on weapon equipment ranging from pistols to machine guns and grenade launchers.  Using a shuffled deck of standard playing cards, turns are determined by the draw of the cards &ndash; red cards allow the red force to move, while black cards allow the blue force to move.<br/>Combat is based on the individual guerilla with a health of four points each.<br/>Optional rules include Personalized Guerilla leaders, each with their own special rules.<br/>Six scenarios are provided with the game, each with their own victory condition and rules for the scenario.  One of the scenarios is designed for four players, while the largest scenario (22 guerillas in combat) plays in about 30 minutes.<br/><br/>Rules are only five pages long and includes double-sides reference chart for weapons and movement effects, two additional pages of optional rules, a diagram illustrating valid attacks, and a sheet containing the six scenarios. The game comes with a preprinted hex-based game map and an uncut token sheet for fire effects and guerillas for both red and blue forces.<br/><br/>",

The rules specify use of an Avalon Hill Stalingrad board so that starting hexes can be specified in terms of Stalingrad locations. Pieces use both hexes and hexsides for movement to double the number of possible facing directions.<br/><br/>Movement is plotted and executed simultaneously. Rules cover gunfire, torpedoes, smokescreens, and ammunition supply. There is no time limit; play continues until the Graf Spee escapes or is sunk.<br/><br/>The stated purpose of the game is to &quot;introduce the designers method of naval combat&quot;.

        "description": "Description from the publisher:<br/><br/>A shark vs manatee? No contest. A shark with a pool cue vs manatee with a bazooka? Interesting... A couple of billion years ago, evolution (or whatever) invented animals. A couple of million years ago our pre-human ancestors invented weapons. A couple of minutes ago we gave the former access to the latter.<br/><br/>Animals with Weapons is a casual card game for 2-4 players. It develops the idea of the traditional trump-card game by incorporating two main decks (Animals and Weapons), along with a 'sub-deck' of Terrain cards, which are combined to make animal/weapon combos. This eliminates much of the repetition of traditional trump-card games and allows strong weapons to compensate for weak animals. A 'capture or loot' mechanic also removes the stalemate which so often develops in trump-card games.<br/><br/>132 cards, with 60 animals in each of the main decks, makes for 3600 combinations in the base game, with multiple game modes to broaden gameplay.<br/><br/>Designed to be played in under half an hour, AWW is quick, brutal and very silly.<br/><br/>",

        "description": "This all-wood game was published in Canada in 1943, clearly cashing in on the popularity of the British wartime Prime Minister. The solid wood board shows a circle with 4 concentric rings divided by 10 radii. There is a centre space marked with a Crown, and each of the 41 resulting spaces has a hole into which a wooden peg can be placed. There is a hole in the side of the board stopped with a cork in which 20 pegs are stored.<br/><br/>Each player starts with 10 pegs, placed in the outer two rings of half the circle. The pegs start with a plain side up, and are marked with the player's colour (red or black) on the other end.<br/><br/>Players move alternately, either clockwise, counter-clockwise or toward the centre. As in normal checkers, they must jump over an opponent into a vacant space if able to do so. A piece moving or jumping into the Crown space at the centre flips into a King, which is then allowed to move and jump outward as well as inward. A piece in the Crown space is safe, and only a King can jump back into the Crown space and continue jumping.<br/><br/>Normally, a player wins be eliminating the opponent's pieces, but there also are rules for a &quot;losing&quot; game where the objective is to give away all your pieces or create a situation where you are unable to move.<br/><br/>While the rules show the publisher as London Novelty and Display Products, the box says it was manufactured by Robinson Industrial - Crafts Limited, also of London, Canada.<br/><br/>",

Combining a Fighter deck and a Sensei deck, players create a unique fighting duo to duel against their opponents.<br/><br/>Combos are formed by pairing a sensei's Style cards with a fighter's Strike cards, creating one of thousands of different moves, like &quot;Flying Kick&quot;, &quot;Fierce Defensive Slash&quot;, and &quot;Ultra Spinning Dragon Uppercut&quot;. Each round, new Styles or Strikes are played, replacing some cards in the players' Combos while retaining the others. Used cards store up Chi energy which can activate special abilities, making every card count. Master your duo's unique strategies and versatile combos to out-fight your opponents to victory!<br/><br/>",

        "description": "A simple yet engaging, tactical trench warfare card game themed around the misery and glory, the hope and despair of one the most historic battles in human history i.e. World War I - Battle of the Somme. It features a patently new and unique COVER AND REQUISITION wargaming system that allows for:<br/><br/>1. 2 player fast paced action<br/>2. Tactical turn-based strategy<br/>3. Grinding trench warfare<br/>4. Simple game mechanics<br/>5. Easy to learn<br/>6. Quick setup<br/>7. Challenging gameplay<br/>8. Suitability for ages 10+<br/>9. Short 15 minutes playtime<br/>10. and much more!<br/><br/>Somme: The Story<br/><br/>The year is 1916. A great war rages across the world. &ldquo;The war to end all wars&rdquo; some call it and it seems to be living up to its name, for a more terrible yet strange war the mankind had not seen before.<br/><br/>It is definitely nothing like those that came before it, for here the men lie, waiting, almost peacefully, in the lines they have drawn. For months together, nothing has stirred over the now, black land. No bird flies over, nor any beast roams here. The silence is almost unbearable, as the men eat, sleep and go about their business in absolute monotony.<br/><br/>Suddenly, the frail sense of security is shattered by a deafening noise, as a bombshell explodes nearby, causing the men to drop their jobs and scuttle for cover. One explosion is followed by another and another and another&hellip; and so the pounding goes on and on&hellip; for days and days&hellip; till all nerves are frayed and every muscle is jittery. Just when they were beginning to think that it would never stop, it ends, as abruptly, as it had started.<br/><br/>Deafened by the onslaught on their ears, the soldiers strain to hear, fearful of that which is to follow. Soon enough, they hear a distant pattering of feet, getting closer and closer or are they? Surely, it is the sound of gunfire that they hear now or are their ears still playing tricks on them? The men arise as if from a great slumber and peer over the parapet. What they see is incredulous, for what was earlier a barren wasteland is now a rising sea before them. Their knuckles whiten as they tighten their grips over their weapons and wait for the incoming tide to draw closer, nay, wash over them.<br/><br/>It is clear, that thousands will die this day and whether or not they themselves would survive, will ultimately depend on your wisdom, as their commander and the support of the brothers, by their sides. So take charge and stand fast. For the empire!<br/><br/>Somme: The game<br/><br/>Setup: To play, each player chooses and commandeers a faction, the British or the German, consisting of a squad of 6 soldiers that are laid out in a couple of trench lines on the table. From among the rest of the shuffled cards, 20 cards are passed between the players and 10 are drafted by each player. Of these 6, are assigned to the soldiers already on the table while the rest 4 are held in the player&rsquo;s hand as faction reserve. 2 cards are opened at the draw pile to form the common supply line.<br/><br/>Strategy: Each of the fighting units under the player&rsquo;s command has a different loadout and a susceptibility to specific hardship cards. Further, the unit loadouts keep changing over the game and may also be affected by unveiling of certain event cards. The crux of the game's strategy however lies in bidding from the supply line which will ultimately decide the actions available in the future.<br/><br/>Objective: The object of the game is simple, eliminate the rival faction before they eliminate you.<br/><br/>Turn Mechanics: The play alternates between the players as they play cards from their reserve to the Personnel Cards in the trench lines seeking to form compatible sets of Attack-Defence Cards in order to launch attacks, counter-attacks or to defend. Dictated by the ensuing card play outcomes, the soldiers may either loose morale, gain morale or be eliminated. At the end of each turn, both the players may bid to draft the available replacement cards from the common supply line as they prepare to face another sapping day in the trenches. Thus, the grinding battle continues, till only one side remains standing.<br/><br/>",

To make matters more difficult, the inmates are grouped into seven factions, and you have to round up as many of these gang members as you can to have any hope of success.<br/><br/>Lockdown! is a streamlined, themed version of the card game Canasta, specifically designed for two players. The 64-card deck consists of 49 Gang cards and 15 Special cards. Major improvements include simplified scoring and opportunities for cunning card play.<br/><br/>One of the problems with Canasta is that the player (or team) which takes the inevitable, massive discard pile will usually win the round. In Lockdown!, discard piles are far more manageable, and you can even remove up to two of them from the game! (Don't worry, there's a counter to this.) Additionally, four cards will score a meld (as opposed to seven in Canasta), and of course there are incentives to go higher than four.<br/><br/>Lockdown! plays quickly, and most of the rules are on the cards for easy reference. First player to 100 wins the game!<br/><br/>",

It is especially good for correlating analog and digital representations of time as well as wording like half past and quarter to. Cards are color coded for the progression of skills in learning to tell time; each color representing time to the hour, the half hour, the quarter hour, in five minute intervals or for all sixty minutes. Points are awarded for setting clocks to the correct time, as well as for correcting clocks to the specified time, making playing a reinforcement of time telling skills.<br/><br/>",

All while surviving encounters from the opposing samurai and a deadly assassin who watches over the dungeon.<br/><br/>The object of the game is to secure the most honor. Players collect honor by picking up tokens, fighting opposing samurai and entering the vault.

His movements are quick and unpredictable. Players will be using action cards to evade the assassin, attack opposing samurai, and manipulate the dungeon paths.<br/><br/>As the game progresses, the Warlord begins caving in the stairways and eventually the vault, thus funneling the players and ramping up the action! The game ends when all carried honor is secured.<br/><br/>The samurai with the most honor earns the privilege of becoming a member of The Emperor's Samurai!<br/><br/>",

The deck size changes depending on the player count (3, 4, or 5) so every game is balanced.<br/><br/>After being dealt their hands and hidden identities, each player bids the number of tricks they will take using gems. Color-coded gems make it easy to see if the bid is under, full, or over. One player may be a saboteur, so you cannot count on every bid being legitimate.<br/><br/>The hand is played out in trick. The Solar suit is always trump. As players take tricks they place their gems on the piles so the status of all bids is apparent to all. After the last trick is taken every player reveals their identity and scores points accordingly. Players move their corresponding cube on the score track until one player makes it to 30 points to win the game.<br/><br/>STORY<br/><br/>Centuries of multilateral conflicts throughout the galaxy are being resolved at the diplomatic conference of the era: The Congress of Zienna.

This expansion features Premium Role cards that change the turn order.  How it works?  At the beginning of each round, players secretly choose a Premium Role card.  That will be the role they are using on their next turn.  Players then simultaneously reveal their role and the order is determined from Highest to Lowest ensuring that the game rounds are always different.<br/><br/>In addition to the Premium Role cards, also included are two (2) expansion Scenarios:  Rise of the Monarch and Battle Front.<br/><br/>As per the original one (1) Player Game Sets, the Rise of the Monarch scenario is back!  This scenario brings back the days of early Renaissance and exploration of the Galaxy.  In this scenario, players race to be the first player to earn the right to be the Monarch Supreme of the galaxy.<br/><br/>The newer addition to the expansion is the Battle Front scenario.  This scenario's goal is to accelerate and shorten the time spent playing the Spacewars scenario.  It can be played as a scenario itself OR as another expansion played together with any of the current multiplayer scenarios (Tradewars, Spacewars or Rise of the Monarch).  In this scenario, players race to obtain &quot;retrofits&quot; for their starships which will give them bonus effects to alter the way space skirmishes are resolved.  There are a total of six (6) different &quot;retrofits&quot; available to each player.  Much like the Days of Glory scenario, the retrofits are unlocked as a player earns more credits.<br/><br/>Also as one of the game's Stretch Goals, we've added a Co-op scenario called United Garrison in which up to four (4) players can combat a Derelict starship that is hell bent on destroying all the player's Homeworlds.<br/><br/>This expansion is comprised of 96 cards for 1 to 4 Players.  It can add from 15-30 minutes of additional game time to the &quot;core&quot; game.<br/><br/>",

Players take on the role of the county&rsquo;s ruling politicians. Their goal is to achieve a secret Ulterior Motive, while stopping their opponents achieving their own, all while trying to rule the country.<br/><br/>Ulterior Motives include seizing the presidency with the support of a paricular faction, embezzling the nation's budget, manipulating the nation into becoming an outpost of the US or USSR, or causing outright civil war and benefiting from the ensuing chaos.<br/><br/>During a turn each player takes four actions, using cards drawn from the Power deck, and other options based on the political landscape of the nation, such as its current Stability, and the levels of foreign influence. These actions include playing Supporter cards to increase their personal strength, and activating abilities, which can  improve their position or hinder an opponent. Some abilities have broader effects, changing the political climate for all players.<br/><br/>Elections and Coups are a key part of the game. Each turn players jockey for political power, and often must rely on the support of their rivals to gain the power they seek. After negotiations are done players reveal their choices simultaneously. This is often accompanied by a fanfare of cheers, laughs, and cries of anguish from the betrayed.<br/><br/>",

        "description": "Atropos is a mathematical (topological) game based on Sperner's lemma. No mathematical background is necessary in order to play the game. The game starts with a triangulation of a big triangle, whose three nodes are colored (say) red, yellow and green. Players take turns and color one vertex of the triangulation in red, yellow or green. There are two restrictions: (1) whenever possible, each player should color an adjacent vertex of the last-played vertex; (2) when coloring a vertex on an edge of the big triangle, only the two colors of its endpoints may be used, not the color of the opposing vertex.<br/><br/>Sperner's lemma guarantees that the game cannot end in a tie: when all vertices of a triangulation have been legally colored, there will always exist a small tricolored triangle (in fact, an odd number of them).<br/><br/>The mathematical complexity game has been studied and found to be PSPACE-complete in 2010 for the special case of a &quot;regular&quot; triangulation. In general, the game can be played with arbitrary triangulations, and with or without the rule that next moves must be adjacent to the last move.<br/><br/>",

        "description": "The fate of the solar system is at stake as several cosmic factions struggle for supremacy. As a commander of a star fleet, it is your duty to position your forces at the right time at the right planet and claim it for your faction. Beware, the strongest faction will claim the entire planet and there is no space for runners-up in the solar system.<br/><br/>The solar system consists of 12 planets, each of them surrounded by six grid points where battle stations may be placed. Some grid points border several planets, hence making their battle stations more powerful. You claim a planet if you have the most battle stations at the end of a round. You win if you claim 3/4/5 planets (5/4/3 players).<br/><br/>Each round you compete for the next planet in order. You do so by playing cards representing either two forces (black) or one force (white). One black card may be played each turn together with none or one white card. The black cards must follow suit while the white cards may be played together with any suit.<br/><br/>When you pass you take the tricks of all forces with a majority and places one battle station for each trick. Also, an early pass gives you an early pick of new cards from a drawing row. However, it makes the remaining tricks easier to get for the other players.<br/><br/>When the round ends, you claim the planet if you have the most battle stations around it. Also, any previous planets that were tied in previous rounds are reassessed to see if the majority has changed. (Remember that a battle station may reach more planets.) One of the tricks allows you to change the order of the planets to take advantage of well positioned battle stations.<br/><br/>",

Learn how to tame the Four Kingdoms.<br/><br/>Designed to be played with 2-8 players, you will only need one 40 card deck to play the game.<br/><br/>HOW TO PLAY<br/><br/>Each player is dealt three cards.<br/><br/>Cards in your hand represent the warriors you have control over. After dealing 3 cards to each player, the next card is dealt face up on the playing surface, and the remaining deck is placed face down. This card is the leading/crown Kingdom, and represents the trump suit for the game.<br/><br/>Play one card each going clockwise, player to the left of the dealer starts. After playing a card, draw one more card from the face down pile.<br/><br/>Winning a hand:<br/><br/>In ascending order:  fewest to most soldiers (they are worth 0 points) then the following: Knight (J) with 2 points; War Princess (Q) with 3 points; King (K) with 4; Supreme Warrior (3*) with 10; and the Kingdom's secret weapon worth 11 points.<br/><br/>If any Leading/Crown Kingdom (trump) has been played, the player who played the highest valued trump wins.  If no Leading/Crown Kingdom (trumps) have been played, the player who played the highest card of the lead suit wins.<br/><br/>Players are not required to follow suit.<br/><br/>Once the winner of a round is determined, that player collects the played cards, and places them face down in a pile. Each player maintains his/her own pile. Then, each player draws a card from the remaining deck, starting with the player who won the trick, proceeding counter-clockwise. The player who won the round leads the next hand.<br/><br/>The winner is the player who won the most important battles and has the most points.  There are 120 points total.<br/><br/>Legends of the Four Kingdoms reimplements the traditional Italian trick-taking game Briscola, with modern artwork and new suits.<br/><br/>",

The youngest player starts by throwing a green die and placing it on the playing surface. This will be the start of the first snake.<br/>TURNS<br/>Each player takes a turn to throw one of their dice and line it up with the part of the snake already on the playing area, thus continuing to create the snake and, hopefully, completing it. A snake is complete when it has a head and a tail. A snake only needs to have two pieces - a head and a tail - to be complete. For each completed snake, the player who placed the final piece earns 1 point. Once a snake has been completed, it is left on the playing area. If you cannot attach the section of the snake obtained from throwing one of your dice, then start a new snake. If there is more than one unfinished snake on the playing area, then the person whose turn it is can decide which snake to continue or complete. After each player has had one turn, it is possible to throw one of the orange dice at any time during the game. If this orange die ends up on one of the standard &ldquo;head&rdquo; or &ldquo;tail&rdquo; faces, then the rules are exactly the same as for the green dice. If the orange die ends up on a &quot;+&quot;, you can take one die (including another orange one, if one is already on the playing area) from the end of a snake in the playing area; you also get to keep the orange die and get to throw again, using the die of your choice, straightaway. If the die that is taken from a snake is removed from a completed snake, then person who originally won a point for completing that snake keeps the point. If the orange die ends up on, you have to give your orange die to the other player and forfeit your turn.<br/><br/>END OF GAME<br/><br/>Every time you complete a snake, you get 1 point. The game ends when all the pieces have been used. The winner is the player with the most points, i.e. the person who completed the most snakes.<br/><br/>",

It is also an unusual gift.<br/>  <br/>COMPONENTS: 34 pawns made of 100% beechwood (100% FSC&reg;) in 6 colours, 1 bag, 1 brochure containing the instructions and the explanation of the colour theory.<br/> INSTRUCTIONS:<br/><br/>Pick a pawn from the bag. There are three ways to conquer the pawns on the field or on top of towers of the other players: 1. Easy: you conquer the pawns of the SAME COLOUR as the one you picked from the bag (example: if you pick a red pawn you can conquer a red pawn) if there is any free on the field or on the top of the towers of the other players. 2. Average: you can conquer pawns according to the SUM OF COLOURS, meaning that you can conquer pawns of the colours that when mixed together make the colour of the pawn you picked (example: a violet pawn can conquer red and blue pawns). 3. Advanced: you can get the pawns of the COMPLEMENTARY COLOUR of the pawn you picked. If you cannot conquer any pawn, leave the picked pawn on the field. The conquered pawns are to be piled up to form a tower. The player who build the highest tower wins the game. In the package you will find the COMPLETE INSTRUCTIONS AND THE COLOUR THEORY<br/><br/>",

Otherwise, they die and lose the game.<br/><br/>The objective of the Solo version of the game is to accomplish your character's End Goal before s/he becomes too cowardly, despairing, mad, reviled, or too dead to continue adventuring.<br/><br/>Different End Goals include: Becoming Accomplished (in a certain discipline or skill), becoming Powerful, being Revered as a god, becoming Renowned (for performing feats), or by attaining great Wealth.<br/><br/>To accomplish the End Goal, the adventurer travels from Location Card to Location Card.<br/><br/>When the adventurer enters a Location, s/he can do one of four things: Make Camp (to hunt and rest), Interact with the displayed NPC, do Trade (rolling on a table), or Explore the Location.<br/><br/>To explore, the Location Card is flipped over, revealing an Encounter. Encounters represent monsters, traps, or perilous situations that must be defeated. Successfully defeating these encounters results in gaining XP and Treasure Cards.<br/><br/>The XP can be used to eventually gain up to three Levels. Each new level has three Skill Cards you can choose from. You place the acquired Skill Card below your Adventurer Card.<br/><br/>Each Encounter displays from one to three Impact Icons, which signify how dangerous, horrifying, and taxing the encounter is to resolve. Unless the adventurer immediately avoids (or escapes) the encounter, s/he will be impacted by interacting with it.<br/><br/>The Encounter Impact will add to the character's Personality, which in turn, affects how effective s/he will be during subsequent encounters.<br/><br/>In addition to encounter impacts, there are Event Cards that come into play for different durations that also display Impact Icons on them.<br/><br/>Whenever conditions in play match those specified on active Event Cards, the event impacts the adventurer. The Event Card is then placed under the Adventurer Card, with the Event Card's bottom section visible from the appropriate side of the Adventurer Card.<br/><br/>A possible outcome of the event is that the character becomes mentally afflicted, emotionally disturbed, or physically maimed.<br/>Thus, as the adventure continues, the character may become too emotionally, psychologically, or physically weak to continue to pursue his or her End Goal. In this case, the adventurer loses the game.<br/><br/>Conversely, the adventurer wins the game by enduring encounters and events (some of which are positive), and by attaining his or her End Goal.<br/><br/>Each End Goal lists varying levels of success, so you always try to score higher in subsequent gaming sessions.<br/><br/>",

        "description": "User summary<br/>東方二面相 ～ reversible Night (Touhou nimensou ～　reversible Night) is a fan fiction / alternate universe card game based on the video game series Touhou Project produced by Team Shanghai Alice.<br/><br/>Each card has 3 suits and effects. A special characteristic of this game is that two cards can be combined into a single double-faced card.<br/><br/>Players should initially be given 2 cards of each of the 9 types for a total of 18 cards. Each player should then proceed to freely combine two differing type cards, back-to-back, to create a total of 9 double-faced cards.<br/><br/>Every card has three suits (Power, Speed, or Brain). The suit that wins or loses the current trick is decided at the exact moment the first player or the winner of the previous trick plays a card. Once the suit has been decided, the card of that suit with the highest value wins the trick.<br/><br/>If there is a tie, all cards with the same highest value are flipped face down and the next highest value is calculated again from the remaining cards in play for the trick. If all players have the same value and the tie cannot be broken, no player is declared as winner for that trick.<br/><br/>The winner of the trick claims the points that were decided at the beginning of the game for each trick. All players, excluding the winner of the trick, may choose to turn over one card in their hand (which gives them a better chance to strategize in secret against their opponents).<br/><br/>Repeat for a total of 9 tricks. At the end, the person with the greatest amount of points is the winner.<br/><br/>A second edition 輝針城編 (Kishinjou edition) was released in 2016, with a new set of cards. Both sets can be mixed together.<br/><br/>Publisher's summary<br/>「東方二面相 ～ reversible Night」は上海アリス幻樂団様制作「東方Project」作品の二次創作カードゲームです。<br/>カード毎に３つのスートと効果を持ち、2枚1組で両面表のカードとして扱うのが特徴です。<br/>プレイヤーはそれぞれ9種類2枚ずつ、計18枚のカードを持ち、種類の異なる2枚の裏を自由に組み合わせて1組にし、両面が表の1枚のカードにします。<br/>カードはそれぞれ３つのスート(パワー・スピード・ブレイン)を持ち、先攻または前トリックの勝者がカードを出すと同時に、このトリックでの勝敗を決めるスートを指定します。<br/>指定スートで数値の大きいカードがそのトリックの勝者ですが、もし引き分けならば、引き分けのカードを全て裏返し、再度数値を比べます。<br/>1度裏返しても同じだった数値のカードは勝敗に含めません(全員が同じ数値だった場合、そのトリックは勝者無しとなります)。<br/>トリックの勝者はゲーム開始時に決めておいたトリックごとの点数を得て、それ以外のプレイヤーは自分の持つカードを1枚裏返すことができます。<br/>9トリック繰り返し、獲得した点数の多いプレイヤーが勝ちとなります。<br/><br/>",

        "description": "Description from the publisher:<br/><br/>Fight for survival during the Solar Conflict. This is Delmer E. Esau's Blak Dragon.<br/><br/>The Techno-Communists have razed the Earth. The former NATO group, now known as the Rogue Army, face the Cyborg Uprising in a thrilling 3D competitive tactical board game series. Also play as the Techno-Communists, the Zero-G Mafia, the Corporates or the Settlers.<br/><br/>This is a biopunk cyber-tactical military board-game. At the dawn of the 22nd century the ambush assault at the hands of the Machine Communists destroyed much of the planet Earth. NATO and others hold on to honour while others like the Zero-G Mafia and Corporates do it for cash. The Settlers, Martians and other Solar communities fend for their land titles and spatial positions.<br/><br/>This game features cutting-edge game technology like layered board modules, dry erase record keeping, character units and multi-theatre elements. Fight it out in orbit while waging a ground campaign at the same time. Large Junkspace orbital cities are often the battleground depicted by map-tile layers that players can record damage, fuel and ammunition supplies on. Virtually any hotspot in Sol system will be supported with full mapping and engineering information; in-game attributes provided on the boards.<br/><br/>Typically a Blak Dragon mission has players' fielding a capitol vessel, with garrisons and hangers bays, against each-other. Players field these capitol ships complete with square 3D map-boards that depict the vessels deck plan and attributes on cards provided (attributes like space travel movement). Also, capitol vessels are represented by a large unit piece on hexagonal map-boards that has three layers that allow three-dimensional fighting in outer space. A vessel's action is planned three moves ahead with secret Command and Network cards being played face down. The vessel's movement, weapons, and network abilities are declared this way. Players will have to guess ahead to what their opponents Commands will be, simulating slow-acting-commands and fog-of-war. Network digital hacks can be assisted by netrunners deployed along with other space infantry units in boarding parties.<br/><br/>ALL vessels from capitol ships to fighter craft are combined with dry erase playing card markers. Fuel, ammo and air are recorded and spendable. Fighters, gunships, mecha, all can move on the main board.<br/><br/>Genre conflict elements include nuclear weapons, cluster missile pods, recoiless A.I. automatics, lasers and hand-to-hand blade and martial arts. Fighter-craft, robotic weapon systems, gunships and stealth units are deployable. Send fighter craft, gunships and mecha to assault enemy vessels in zero gravity space and wage infantry battles with your boarding parties. Die rolling and skill attributes compared with die-rolling, armor and dodge determine damage and or loss of units.<br/><br/>Also, the Uplift Community, everyone from the Dolphins to the Dawgs, will be represented. Dolphin Settlers have a stake-hold on Mars with their backs to the Earth investment, now vital. Dawg mercenary  infantry companies  are deployed across theatre. The space breather group once known as shipbuilders rebel at lost fees and exile and are now called the &quot;Zero-G Mafia&quot;. Cockroachers stake-held Saturn as well having better fared the scourge of stolen ships.<br/><br/>Characters exist in Blak Dragon with special abilities and strengths. You will recognize them from the novel Blak Dragon released in 2013.<br/><br/>Look forward to more incredible news about the Blak Dragon Era in the &quot;Infantry&quot; expandable hybrid media universe soon.<br/><br/>",

They must use a car until it has parked and then they can use their second car, and so on. First to park all 4 of their cars, wins.<br/><br/>Roll the number die to move your car. You can go in any direction. A parking space must be reached exactly. When you park a car you must roll the number die again together with the letter die (this is called &quot;paying the parking metre&quot;). The throw will probably refer to a parking space somewhere on the board, the number die reveals the area and the letter die reveals the actual parking place in that area. Any car in that space must be moved back to the start. Should a blank be rolled on the letter die any cars in the parking places must 'feed the meter again' i.e. roll the number and letter dice again.<br/><br/>The game is undated but an educated guess would be around 1960. Interestingly, even with fewer people around, it was still difficult to find a parking space!<br/><br/>",

Neither by your brothers adventuring in your room while you are out nor by your mother cleaning frenetically her lovely child's room.<br/><br/>Unlike the title might suggest, the art is absolutely safe for all players : only the 'concept' is perverted. The game is  mainly aimed at a male audience, nostalgic of their youth.<br/><br/>",

Each player is a receptionist and their goal is the same. Once the guest deck is empty the game is finished and whoever collected the most money wins the game.<br/><br/>While the players take turns in the reception each player can intervene by playing Challenge cards to stall the progress of other players, who can counter these with Rescue cards. You gain these cards by spending action points which are also used for checking in guests and selling extra services and you can get them depending on which type of guest you choose to check in the hotel. There are Penniless, Fishy, Lovely and Rich guests each with their own abilities and available money. The guests also have preferences in terms of rooms and extra services. In case a guest doesn't like the room you choose for him/her they might get offended which will cost you!<br/><br/>The game will contain the following parts:<br/>one large board, <br/>5 decks of cards (Guest cards, Room cards, Challenge cards, Rescue cards and Extra services cards), <br/>4 receptionist figures, <br/>48 coloured wooden discs for each player (action points), <br/>4 dice, <br/>a rule booklet <br/>20 playing money notes of each type (500, 100, 50, 10).<br/><br/>",

        "description": "Your town &mdash; your life &mdash; hasn't been the same since HE came to power. He rules with fear and violence, and no one dares stand up to him. No one but you. Starting with nothing more than righteous indignation, you acquire the training, resources, equipment, and experience needed to take down the Nemesis and get back your life. You move in the shadows. You let nothing and no one stand in your way. You are a vigilante!<br/><br/>Objective:<br/>In Vigilante, the goal is to become the first player to reach 40 Experience Points, then defeat the Nemesis.<br/><br/>Player Ability Slots<br/>Your playmat lets you keep track of your progress as you complete your costume. You can have 1 Head Equipment, 1 Body Equipment, 2 Arm Equipment, and 2 Signature Moves/Weapons. If you acquire Equipment, but there is no room for it, you gain the E.P. from it, but then must decide which card will stay on your playmat. The other card is removed from the game. It also states your character bonus. This bonus can be used once every turn and represents your area of expertise.<br/><br/>Turn Overview:<br/>Each turn you will be using your skills (dice) to increase your experience and bring you closer to facing the Nemesis. Each turn consists of three phases:<br/>1) Upkeep Phase.<br/>2) Roll Skill Dice.<br/>3) Use Skill Dice.<br/><br/>Using Skill Dice:<br/>Once you have finished rolling your dice, you may engage them to further your plans. Dice can be used to Obtain Equipment, Steal Equipment, Discard an Equipment Card, Train, Gain Resources, trade one color of cubes for the other (Focus Intent) Obtain New Skills, or Patrol the City. You can do as many of these actions each turn as your dice will allow, in any order you want. If you cannot or do not want to perform any of these actions, you may just pass your turn.<br/><br/>Game End<br/>The game ends as soon as one player can defeat the Nemesis. To challenge the Nemesis, you must first reach (or pass) the 40 spot on the Experience Point Track. Once this is done, you can challenge the Nemesis. You must declare that you are challenging the Nemesis at the beginning of your turn after the upkeep phase, but before rolling any dice. Move your maker off the board and place it next to the area marked &ldquo;Level One&rdquo; on the Nemesis card.<br/><br/>To defeat the Nemesis, you must be able to overcome all three levels on their card. You do not have to overcome all three levels in the same turn. If you overcome a level, you may move your marker to the next level and end your turn. You may also press your luck and attempt to overcome another level. If you do so, you gain the reward from completing the level. You can then re-roll your dice up to three more times, but none of the equipment you&rsquo;ve used so far is refreshed. If you ever fail to complete a level, you lose all of the progress you made this turn and must move your marker back to the level it was on at the beginning of your turn.<br/><br/>You do not have to challenge the Nemesis each turn after acquiring 40 Experience. You can still use your turns to gain more equipment, experience, or training before attempting to challenge the Nemesis.<br/><br/>",

It is done in a safe, child-friendly, educational way, using &quot;knowledge&quot; and &quot;strategy&quot; cards to inform children about best practices and response to violence. It also gives children a platform to speak about abuse and violence.<br/><br/>Each player moves on the board by the roll of a die. The goal is to complete the four &quot;Rites of Passage&quot; in order. Each Rite of Passage is completed by collecting cards, depending on the space that the player landed on. These cards are either Reward Cards (where the player immediately receives some sort of benefit) or Strategy Cards (where the player must answer a question about what they would do in a real-life situation).  It is suggested that the game is moderated by a licensed practitioner, who is responsible for rewarding the players who have made good choices.<br/>The game was commissioned by &quot;Victim Services of Peel [Ontario]&quot;, a municipal organization that deals with families and children of abuse. It was made specifically for practitioners working in that environment. It is recommended that the game is played only with a licensed professional, as it is used mainly as a teaching and healing tool for victims of domestic violence.<br/><br/>",

It's a roll-and-move affair, but with one player playing the Atom Bomb and moving around a doomsday-clock circle while the other 1-5 players move Nation pieces cooperatively on a spiral toward the goal of a single world government through the UN.<br/><br/>The components include 8 lettered Nation pieces, 34 Vote cards, 36 Goodnews cards, 36 Badnews cards and markers for the A-bomb and the number of its trips around the clock. The Nation players on their turns roll two dice and can move any of the pieces by either or both dice. Each starts with a single Vote card and adds another each time a Nation piece reaches the center or when a third Nation is moved onto a space with two others. There are spaces marked with a &quot;?&quot;, and when a Nation lands on such a space, the Nations players each get to draw and act on a Goodnews card.<br/><br/>The Bomb player also rolls two dice, and can use them either to move the bomb forward or to move one or two Nations backward onto a &quot;?&quot; by exact count. If the Bomb player does so, all Nations players must take and act on a Badnews card.<br/><br/>If the Bomb player completes a number of circuits that varies with the number of players, the world blows up and the Bomb player wins. If the Nation players get all of the nations to the middle to spell &quot;One World&quot;, the UN brings all the peoples of the world together in a new Golden Age, where &quot;taxes are a joke, starvation and illiteracy are gone, disease is conquered, you still have money to burn... and your workday is cut in two.

        "description": "This 1930s game came in a solid wood box. The lid lifted off to form the playing field, with individual yard markings and eight lines running the length of the field lettered A-G. A wooden bar on a slider is used to mark the position of the ball, and there is a metal 10-yard marker that slides up one side of the lid.<br/><br/>The base has a large mechanism in the center, with a brass spinner embedded in a wooden wheel with 19 spaces numbered in a random order. The wheel in turn has a knob that is used to rotate the wheel against numerically ordered numbers on the surrounding board. There are six small windows on each side of the wheel, with the offense to the left and the defense to the right.<br/><br/>The offensive player has three play options (line buck, forward pass or end run) as well as three kicking plays (kick-off, goal kick and punt). The defensive player has a matching set of windows.<br/><br/>The offensive player calls a play, spins the spinner, and then rotates the wheel so that the spun number on the wheel aligns with the same number on the outer circle. He then reads the initial results of the play from the appropriate offensive window. The defensive player then spins, using the wheel to produce additional results in the matching window. For instance, an offensive pass play might read &quot;25 yds A&quot;, a gain of 25 caught at the sideline. The defensive window would then indicate whether the pass was complete, incomplete, intercepted or triggered an offensive or defensive penalty.<br/><br/>The game proceeds and scores using normal football rules. The intricate double spinner and interlocking wheel mechanism is unusual, as is the solid wood construction. But except for the limited offensive play calling options, the results are essentially random.<br/><br/>",

The score for the word is based on the product of the number of letters in the word played and the value on a multiplier chance card selected during the player turn.  The multiplier cards have values of 0 to 10, -5 and -10.  Hence playing a large word may be a good thing, or a bad thing.<br/><br/>The game board has 676 spaces for word forming (26x26 spaces).<br/><br/>There are also other types of chance cards:<br/><br/><br/>     Bonus word cards that allows the player to play a second word during their turn.<br/>     A swap tiles card which causes the players to switch their game tiles with that of the player to their left.<br/>     A bankrupt card which sets the total score of the player to zero.  If chosen early in the game, the player can recover.  This card is only put in the card deck if there are three or more players.<br/><br/><br/>We think that the ability to make larger words and the addition of chance makes WordChance lots fun to play.<br/><br/>",

I&rsquo;ve made plenty of games &ndash; I&rsquo;ve provided more games to the American people than Obama ever will, ever has been, will go, games. And this one &ndash; it&rsquo;s the greatest game of all time, mark my words. The best. Anyone that says different &ndash; we&rsquo;re fighting a war here, ladies and gentlemen, a war, against fake news. If this game doesn&rsquo;t get funded, we&rsquo;ll know &ndash; it&rsquo;s phony, America. This game is going to be huge. *Small loans of a million dollars are accepted and encouraged.<br/><br/>How It Works?<br/><br/>Based off the popular game Mafia, Not My President is a high-energy, 3-12 player game of deception that lasts 5-10 minutes per round. Using your best poker face, diversionary tactics, and a lot of finger pointing, the goal of Not My President is to either find the Trump Supporters amongst you, or, if you are one, to keep yourself hidden through any means necessary. Lying, spreading chaos, and blaming others are highly encouraged tactics. The game begins when players randomly select and privately view a &ldquo;role card,&rdquo; dividing the party into two groups: Trump Supporters and Reasonable People. Players then close their eyes for the election night. During this phase, the free app guides you through the special abilities of your assigned roles. Players secretly swap cards, change identities, and cause more mayhem than a private email server. When everyone has taken their turn, players open their eyes, and the accusations begin. After 5-10 minutes, players vote for who they believe to be the most likely Trump Supporter. If they&rsquo;re wrong, the Trump Supporters win. If they&rsquo;re right, it&rsquo;s probably fake news, and the Reasonable People win.<br/><br/>Narration:<br/><br/>Because this game is so great and since we don't want anyone to feel left out of the party we have made a free downloadable app to narrate the game! Trust me its not Skynet, an extremely credible source told me so. Includes adjustable settings and soundtracks for those of you who like to spice things up a little.<br/><br/>",

The wrestlers must have good Chanko-Nabe from the kitchens (Chanko casseroles, a typical food for Sumo wrestlers). You must recruit new Rikishi (wrestlers), and they visit the Ozashiki (parlours) to gain support from Geisha and Oiran. Ultimately the wrestlers will gain victory at the Dohyo (Sumo ring) by pushing off the opponent, sometimes with support from Ninja actions.<br/><br/>This is a 2 player game of comparing numbers in three areas, the Dohyo, the Kitchen, and the Ozashiki. Each section gives you a different victory bonus which you can use further on. Play RIKISHI cards face-down from your hand against these sections, apply any extra actions (such as revealing cards or moving cards) and then compare strengths. The winner of the section advances their chip and this helps them further.<br/><br/>Winning in the Dohyo is crucial to victory, but without Kitchen and Ozashiki support, you would eventually fail there. Secure your strength, and aim for victory.<br/><br/>Publisher's summary<br/>DOSUKOIは相撲を世界観にしたゲームとなっておりゲームボードとカード チップを使用したゲームになります。<br/><br/>世界観<br/>プレイヤーは、相撲部屋の親方となり、台所で美味しいちゃんこを作り新しい力士をスカウトしたり、<br/>お座敷に通い芸者や花魁の応援をもらいながら、時には忍者を暗躍させ、土俵で勝利し相手プレイヤーを押し出し最強を目指す。<br/><br/>このゲームは土俵と台所、お座敷というそれぞれ勝利ボーナスが違う3つの場所で、手札から出すRIKISHI達の数比べが基本的なシステムとなっております。<br/><br/>土俵で勝つとゲームの勝利に近づけますが、台所やお座敷で自身の相撲部屋を強くしないと負けます。うまく強くしながら、土俵での勝利を目指します。<br/><br/>",

Two players kneel on the floor opposite each other, with cards arranged in front of them. On each card are small pieces of text from classic poetry, and typically with a small illustration.<br/><br/>A separate Reader chooses from a random deck and sings a phrase out loudly. The players must search to find the matching couplet on their cards and either grab or block the appropriate card. Whoever snatches the most cards wins. Play is very swift and physically as well as mentally demanding.<br/><br/>This game, Color Code, is basically the same. The difference is that there are no illustrations on the played cards, but instead a single color is printed on them. The Reader doesn't read a phrase, but calls out an HTML color-code, like #FFFFFF or #FF0000. When the Reader calls a code, the players must know which color it is and make their play. So if the Reader calls &quot;#FF0000&quot;, players must grab the red card.<br/><br/>Publisher's summary<br/>WEBページの色を指定する１６進数のRGBカラーコードを読み上げ、該当する色カードをとる速度を競う、かるた風カードゲームです。<br/><br/>",

        "description": "Description from the publisher:<br/><br/>End Days: Atlantis is a cooperative, dungeon crawler deckbuilding game for 3 players. You have been called upon as champions of New Atlantis to save the city from Armageddon. Lost knowledge capable of redeeming the city is kept in a sacred, ancient tome affixed with multiple seals. Each player assumes the role of 1 of 3 characters with unique classes-- Warrior, Witch, or Wizard. Your quest is to break each seal, which binds the ancient tome, in order to reveal the mystical knowledge and save New Atlantis from catastrophe. But it isn't easy. To break each seal, the party must leave the safety of the city and travel to a dangerous land to vanquish the evil inhabitants within. Only then, can the seals be broken,the book read, and New Atlantis restored.<br/><br/>Games may be played from 1 to 5 seals, each seal taking about an hour each.  Each seal contains 5 enemies.  When injured by an enemy, players add a wound card to the top of their deck.  Each class has a certain number of cards and abilities that must be played each turn, and the party is defeated if any player is forced to play a wound.  Special abilities and attacks require charges from crystals, the major Atlantean power source.  Loot and experience are awarded after each battle which can be used to upgrade weapons, crystals, and cards within each player's deck. After each seal is completed, the party can return to Atlantis to receive special benefits such as removing all wounds of one color from their deck, trading in loot, and recharging all of their crystals.<br/><br/>",

        "description": "The Big Stream has been taken over by Invasive Species!  Join Olive and her friends from the popular children's book series on an adventure to meet the local stream residents and clear out the invaders!  While it may be based on a book series for kids, the  gameplay appeals to a much broader audience.<br/><br/>In Chuckin' Bugs, you collect an assortment of flies in your &quot;fly box&quot; (your card hand) and make casts to The Big Stream where you encounter 10 species of fish, Invasive Species, and hazards that get in the way of your fishing!  Match fly colors to the fish's preferences and roll dice to reel them in!  You also get to cooperate with other players to get Invasive Species out of the river and prevent them from completely shutting down the fishing.<br/><br/>Gameplay:<br/><br/>On their turn, players draw a card to their fly box (hand) and either make a cast with a fly of their choosing, or play one of several special &quot;helper&quot; cards.  When making a cast, the player places their fly on the table and declares which card in The Big Stream they are casting to.  The Big Stream card is turned over revealing either a fish, invasive species, or hazard.  If a fish is revealed, it shows its fly preferences, which dictates how many dice you get to roll and what number is needed to succeed in catching it.<br/><br/>The game includes two card decks: The Big Stream and Camp Tightloops.  The Big Stream contains fish, Invasive Species, hazards, and weather events.  Camp Tightloops contains three different types of flies in four different colors and special cards to give you an edge when you need it.  Some high points fish in The Big Stream require very specific flies to have a chance at them, just like big fish int he real world!  But, if you don't have the right fly in the box, you have the option of playing your special cards, wild cards, or creating a &quot;wild&quot; out of playing different fly type/color combinations with multiple cards.  Invasive species yield points to both players who cooperate in defeating them, and the player who cleans out the most invasives gets a bonus point token at the end of the game.<br/><br/>Is the best strategy to go for several smaller fish or take a chance on the larger high point fish? Should you go after the growing invasive species threats hoping they will pay off, or go immediately for the easy fish you know are there? Do you take chances on netting another player's fish to split the points with them or hope they fail their roll? Every time you play Chuckin' Bugs, The Big Stream has changed like your favorite fishing river.  You never know what lurks under the surface!<br/><br/>",

It is an art to play R&eacute;galez!<br/><br/>During the game, players place tiles showing various patterns in six colours, such as hearts or clovers, good or bad fruit. Players make connections and grow the plants, and then score points by cutting off branches. But avoid taking bad fruit, which will lose you points.<br/><br/>The intent is to be artistic and make patterns while scoring points. Try not to interfere with your opponents with dead leaves or flowers. Deciding where to branch out, and which branches to cut needs intuition, intellect and some luck.<br/><br/>The game can be played solo and even if you don't know the rules, you can still connect beautiful tiles and play!<br/><br/>Come on, R&eacute;galez together!<br/><br/>",

The events are represented by hexagonal tiles on a board showing the three levels of the Meepleton Convention Center, as well as four hotels where the players start each day.<br/><br/>Each player's limited stamina restricts the number of games they can attend, but stamina refreshes daily. Claiming a seat at an event requires at least two turns: one to move to that event hex, and one to claim the seat by spending stamina. There is only one open seat per day at each event. Each game event has a type, such as board game or cosplay, each with its own section of the board; within that area, the seven events of that type are distributed randomly for every game. Each game also has a theme, such as zombies or space wars, and one of each theme in each type are spread across the board.<br/><br/>Money is used to pay for hotel rooms and for cards in the exhibit hall. Players can also buy food at food stop locations, with food providing extra stamina. Money does not refresh, and the initial supply must last the entire convention. Exhibit hall cards give bonus actions or points, but the exhibit hall is only open for certain hours each day. The exhibit hall also contains one demo per game type. These events do not have themes. A time track advances one hour per round, from 8 a.m. to midnight, and then from Friday to Saturday to Sunday.<br/> Players win by accumulating the most &quot;Nerd Cred&quot;, which comes from two main sources, scored at the game's end:<br/><br/><br/>    Event Types &mdash; The player who claims the most of each type of event scores that many points (0 to 8, including demos.) Two-way ties split the points. Ties of three or more players score no points.<br/>    Themes &mdash; All players receive Nerd Cred based on the number of events played in each theme (0 to 7), according to a progressive scale.<br/><br/><br/>A few bonus points can come from exhibit hall cards or unused money. The game includes a scoring sheet for easy calculation.<br/><br/>",

        "description": "User summary<br/>就カツ！ (Shukatsu!) is an educational game aimed at helping graduates prepare for the job market.<br/><br/>Until recently, it was very unusual for people to switch jobs, as many employers would be very loyal to their staff and effectively provide a job for life (evidenced by the ubiquitous Japanese 'salary-man'). You try to get into a good company on your first go and prosper for life, or get hired by an unknown small company and you are doomed. Changing jobs suggests to employers that there is something wrong with you.<br/><br/>Therefore, for pre-graduates, the process of landing your first job became hugely important, really defining your whole future. This process is called 就活 (Shuukatsu),from two words: 就職 (Shuushoku) meaning 'to get a job' and 活動 (Katsudou) meaning 'activity'.<br/><br/>This game Shukatsu! is a co-operative game to simulate the experience of winning a job offer. The game was designed and published by a professional career advisor. He says &quot;Experience an year of job hunting, in an hour. The game is based on 20 years experience as an advisor, you would have a live experience. You may try to beat it purely as a game, but also it may be used as an job-hunting support tool. In that case, the creator may act as a facilitator to gain the best effects.&quot;<br/><br/>The game uses various types of cards, for example, for the job-hunters:<br/>Activity card - study companies, attend ability training session.<br/>Weakness card - don't study for unknown matters, habitual latecomer, impatient.<br/><br/>For the employers:<br/>Company card - industrial newspaper press, internet brokerage.<br/>Hiring requirements - co-operativeness 3+, aspiration 3+.<br/><br/>Also, some cards have Bad Events, for example:<br/> - too busy on part-time job.<br/> - suffer burnout.<br/><br/>On the setup, lay out some company cards and assign them requirements cards. These would be the goals of the game for the job-hunters.<br/><br/>Each of the players will be assigned some parameters, and some Weakness cards. By using the Activity cards, players work together to overcome those weakness, and eventually meet the requirements of those companies.<br/><br/>Every once in a while, some Bad Events occur. Players must also work together to beat them too. At the end of the game year, if all of the players have managed to meet the requirements of some of the companies, they are hired and they win. If anyone fails to get a job, they all lose.<br/><br/>Publisher's summary<br/>キャリアアドバイザーが作った「就職内定」のためのゲーム。<br/>1年間の就職活動を、1時間で体験することができます。20年間のアドバイザー経験をもとに制作したので、ゲームとは思えないリアルな体験が得られます。<br/>純粋なゲームとして攻略してもいいですが、制作者がファシリテータとなって、就職活動支援のコンテンツとしていただくことで、より高い効果が得られます。<br/><br/>",

        "description": "Isle of Domination is a turn-based Strategy-Economy Board Eurogame.<br/><br/>The game starts with random map creation. Several hexes build up the map in any shape. There are also resource-tokens placed on some hexes those add more randomness to the map.<br/>Players can build cities, armies on game map.<br/><br/>Gameplay goes around resources. There are two types of resources: <br/><br/>     Countable resources like food, wood, stone, ore, test-tube and gold. <br/>     Special resources like horse, iron, fish, wheat, marble, diamond and mana are used to develop (science) or build (building) something. <br/><br/><br/>There is no storage for resources, a player needs to have access (by having a city near the resource) to certain number and type of resources to build something. Food is the most important resource, each city, extra population and army eats one food. You need food-surplus to build a city/army/extra population, but no problem if your food production goes under your food production (no starving to death).<br/><br/>Each player has an Economy Page (like character page in RPGs), that shows the state of his empire. Players use small markers for recording various things.<br/><br/>Player's turn have 4 phases:<br/><br/>     Money Phase: Player adds the number of his/her gold production to treasury. (Gold is the only resource in Isle of Domination, that is storaged.)<br/>     Army Moving Phase: Players can move their armies by grid lines of hexes. Combat system is very simple: if attacker's army is stronger than defender army, defender army has to be withdrawn. No die rolling this time. Army power is based on sciences, and have modifiers by terrain, city or buildings.<br/>     Dismiss Phase: Player can dismiss any number of cities, armies and extra population to create the needed food-surplus to build something.<br/>     Building Phase: Player can build a City (on a hex edge occupied by an army), increase Population, build an Army, develop a Science and/or build a Building in this phase.<br/><br/><br/>The goal of this game is to reach one of the six Victory Conditions. It is possible that all other Players have stronger economies, stronger armies and bigger empires, but still you win because you reach one of the Victory Conditions.<br/>There are 6 different types of Victory:<br/><br/><br/>     Territory Victory: You dominate by having a large number of cities.<br/>     Military Victory: You dominate by having a very strong and large army.<br/>     Population Victory: You dominate by outnumbering others in population.<br/>     Science Victory: You dominate by knowledge. (You develop Future Science 2.)<br/>     Cultural Victory: You dominate by your people's cultural influence. (You build Cathedral.)<br/>     Magical Victory: You dominate by magical superiority. (You have a city near every Mana resource.)<br/><br/><br/>Randomized map preparation may make some of the Victory types easier than others. But when several players pursuit the same victory, it will be much more difficult to achieve it.<br/><br/>",

        "description": "Wage War in the Steampunk Apocalypse<br/>The world has changed. Over a hundred years have passed after the American War for Independence was interrupted by the opening of the first rift and the Legion of Damned poured though. Humanity was facing extinction at the hands of the demonic and undead. Finally the Angelics arrived and set a stop to the expansion of the rifts and halted the free roaming Legion hordes. Once on the brink of extinction humanity has surged back, forging new countries and technologies. Now after decades of rebuilding the uneasy peace is starting to fracture. Skirmishes are becoming more frequent along the borders and nations turn to warmongering.<br/>Titan Zero Industries LLC presents Ictus, a table top wargame set in the Stempunk apocalypse of 1909. Ictus features high quality miniatures, six unique factions, an all-new stacking rule set and multiple game scenarios including cooperative play. <br/>In standard Skirmish or competitive game scenarios the goal is to eliminate the other player(s) officers. However, in cooperative play scenarios the goals of the game can vary to include eliminating the enemy, surviving for a number of rounds or achieving a set goal. <br/>Each unit is a paintable miniature that comes with a corresponding card that details the abilities of that character. While many abilities are set, conflict is resolved by the rolling of six sided dice (D6), with rolls of 5&rsquo;s and 6&rsquo;s being considered successful. Stacking is the major game mechanic. The Shield Warden unit, for example, provides a +1 defensive bonus to all allies within 1&rdquo;. If there are three Shield Wardens within 1&rdquo; of each other the bonuses stack and each unit would receive a +3 defensive bonus.<br/>There are six different factions to choose from; the British American Colonies, Mercenaries, United American Territories, Legion of Damned, Republic of Cascadia and Empire of Castile. Each faction has a unique look and play style.<br/><br/>",

Avoid zombie attacks, backstab other survivors and fight to be the last remaining survivors!<br/><br/>Each player receives seven cards from the Prime deck and two survivors with ten health each. Each round, a player can discard a Set (1, 2, 3, 4, 5 or 6 of a Kind), a Run (3-7 consecutive cards), or Scavenge cards and finish their turn with 7 cards in hand. The next player in turn must respond to the play by matching or raising the Set or Run to avoid a zombie attack (indicated by the amount of zombies visible on the table). If Scavenge cards have been discarded, the players must respond accordingly. When a survivor is killed, they turn into zombies, increasing the amount of zombies in an attack. The game is over when there is only one player with survivors.<br/><br/>In essence, Strandead is a trick-taking card game. Players must choose their plays carefully, in order to survive the next attack and backstab other players in turn. Every survivor has a unique ability that can shift the game in their favour. An ever-growing number of Zombies continue to make the attacks more vicious as the game progresses, leading to a fast paced, hectic and unique experience.<br/><br/>Strandead is designed for 2-4 players, with an average playtime of 20 mins.<br/><br/>",

The triangles are &quot;cut&quot; in one of three ways (horizontal, vertical and centered cut) which works as suits, and the numbers 1, 2 and 3 of the same cut make a complete triangle.<br/><br/>There are 81 triangle pieces and 9 whole triangles (jokers) in each deck.<br/><br/>Each installment in the Triangles series has a distinct visual theme and rules for two games: a base game titled &quot;Triangle Mayhem&quot; and a bonus game only introduced in that particular installment, however any Triangles game can be played with any of the decks.<br/><br/>The bonus game in &quot;Triangles: Original is titled &quot;Triangle Tricks&quot;, and the deck features photographic artwork from the world cities of Sydney, Los Angeles and London.<br/><br/>TRIANGLE MAYHEM: Complete triangles by playing cards (triangle pieces) at the center of the table. The table is free for all meaning anyone can start a new triangle, continue an existing triangle, or complete a triangle by playing the final missing piece. Multiple triangles can be in the making simultaneously and whoever completes a triangle scores its cards.<br/><br/>TRIANGLE TRICKS: A trick-taking game with a twist where the highest number (1-3, joker) takes the trick. In the event that two players are tied the same trick continues and all players - even those who played a low card - are still in the game. Points can can quickly stack up and experienced players will know when to play low cards, trusting that other players will tie to keep the trick going for another round.<br/><br/>",

The deck has 52 cards in 4 colours numbered 0-12, and 4 jokers.<br/><br/>The jokers have mathematical operators *, +, - and = so you can make your own calculations using the cards.<br/><br/>Designed to function like a regular deck of cards, SimplyClever.Cards Arithmetic allows you to play any regular card game you want to - but with a mathematical twist! Game examples: 500, Blackjack, Bridge, Casino, Crazy Eights, Durak, Egyptian Ratscrew, Go Fish, Hearts, Memory, Old Maid, Poker, Rummikub, Slap Jack, Snap, UNO, Whist<br/><br/>The key mechanic is that each card lists 5 multiplication products at the bottom, below the main card value (ranging from 0 to 12). Mathematical versions of regular card games are created by combining three cards such that the product of two card values can be found among the 5 listed on a third card.<br/><br/>E.g. if you take one card numbered 11 and one card numbered 12, you need to match these with a third card that has the product 132 at the bottom. These three cards can represent different equations such as multiplication 11x12=132, division 132/12=11 or even fractions 1/12=11/132.<br/><br/>",

        "description": "Description from the publisher:<br/><br/>Just beneath the surface, where few are brave enough to venture, there is a war raging out of control. You are a biologically engineered &quot;Super-Bug&quot;, and must fight for survival. Dive inside the human body to experience the combative microcosm inside all of us.<br/><br/>Basic Overview<br/><br/>Bio-Logic is a fast-paced, hybrid tile-placement/dungeon crawler game that allows 2-6 players to infect and manipulate the world around them for ultimate domination. 6 unique &quot;Super-Bugs&quot; are pitted against one another in a battle to the death, inside the human body. Your goal is to infect as much of the body as possible and destroy all the other invasive Bugs. Ensure your survival by utilizing choice character development, performing combat, and strategizing tile placement. The game's system is balanced enough for anyone to jump in. At the same time, it's deep enough to offer, nearly, infinite potential for strategy. In Bio-Logic, resources are limited and foes are many, so you must adapt and evolve or you will certainly fade from existence.<br/><br/>Unique Character Development<br/><br/>All players begin with a choice stat bonus and a special inherent traits These traits can grant special boosts and bonus rewards, manipulate player or enemy stats, or protect oneself from the reactive world. Every Bug has its own advantage/strategy with the capacity to evolve new abilities.<br/><br/>Combat/Infecting....Vs. World, Vs. Players<br/><br/>Developing ones Bug, involves infecting the world around you for stat boosting rewards. Some tiles are infected instantly. However, greater rewards are reserved for combat. Those who attempt to infect the vital organs, must use combat. There are 3 levels of tiles for a player to choose from as they grow. Each tier offers greater obstacles but with greater rewards for the victor.<br/><br/>Players also have the option of fighting one another to steal resources and abilities. Some Bugs are better made for this than others. You can use this feature to sabotage the lead players advance, steal your favorite choice abilities, or monopolize a tile type. Bio-Logic is all about choice and strategy, but you must push forward at all costs, for hesitation will bring only certain defeat.<br/><br/>Tile-Placement/World Manipulation<br/><br/>While building your character and fighting for resources, the human you infect is also attempting to eradicate you. Special enemy tiles have the ability to instantly alter many in-game stats. But it's not totally out of your control, you have a choice in how you reveal the board. The way you place tiles plays a big role in how the game progresses. Some enemies have effects that can activate as soon as the tile is put into play, while others wait until they are infected to cause a reaction. Not only does your development need attention, but so does the evolving world in which you live. Bio-Logic is always changing and you must learn to adapt if you are to survive.<br/><br/>Final Words<br/><br/>Bio-Logic takes you into an environment unlike any other. With 3 random draw piles, choice tile placement, special abilities, and limited resources no game is ever the same. On any given turn you must make decisions that affect the entire game world, altering everyone's future. It's a delicate dance where you must evaluate every aspect of development to ultimately claim victory over your friends. In Bio-logic, you must master your universe or get wiped from existence.<br/><br/>",

Connect four or more of the same colored stones to remove them. Place three of the removed stones to your opponents' play area to hinder them, and the remaining stones to your spell-casting area.<br/><br/>Stones in your spell-casting area may be moved to the &quot;used&quot; area to trigger special effects, such as, using two white stones may trigger an effect of &quot;swap any 2 stones&quot;, or &quot;move 1 stone to an adjacent space&quot;. The first player to place 10 or more gems to their spell-casting area is the winner.<br/><br/>This game was produced with help from the artists group ぐったりにゃんこ (Guttari Nyanko), who provide free material for game designers and publishers.<br/><br/>Publisher's summary<br/>黒い袋の中からランダムに魔法石を取り出し、６&times;６マスのフィールドに配置していくパズルゲームです。同じ色の魔法石を４つ以上つなげると消すことができます。消した石のうち、３つを対戦相手のフィールドに配置して妨害し、残りを自分の詠唱領域に配置します。詠唱領域にある魔法石は未使用から詠唱済に移動することで、色ごとに異なる能力を使用することができます。たとえば、白の魔法石なら、２つの魔法石の入れ替えか、魔法石の１マス移動を行うことができます。最終的に、自分の詠唱領域に、最初に10個以上の魔法石を置いたプレイヤーが勝者となります。<br/><br/>",

        "description": "Triangle Maker is an abstract strategy game in which two to four players compete by forming triangles.  Players use the thirteen pieces to make triangles to score points.  This educational board game is a fun way to hone players&rsquo; creativity, spatial awareness, critical thinking, and concentration.<br/><br/>The two movable pieces are the game changers of Triangle Maker.  Clever use of these pieces can tip the balance to your side and name you the ultimate victor!<br/><br/>The goal of the game is to make the most and/or biggest triangles with the pieces available to earn the most points.  Every newly formed triangle adds to your score.  However, there is one rule:  You cannot place pieces where the same colored lines overlap.<br/><br/>There are four different ways to play Triangle Maker:<br/><br/>1. Card Game<br/><br/>a. Shuffle the cards<br/>b. When it is your turn, draw the first card and place the corresponding piece onto the board. (Earn tokens based on the number or size of the triangle<samp> made)<br/>c. You can use either of the movable pieces during your turn instead of drawing your next card.<br/>d. Whoever gets the most points wins!<br/><br/>2. Strategy Card Game<br/><br/>a. Shuffle the cards and draw two cards.<br/>b. When it is your turn, use one of the pieces on the drawn cards and place it onto the board. (Earn tokens based on the number or size of the triangle<samp> made)<br/>c. During the next turns, remember to draw a card to replace the one used and then repeat the above step.<br/>d. Whoever gets the most points wins!<br/><br/>3. No-Card Game<br/><br/>a. When it is your turn, place any piece onto the board.  (Earn tokens based on the number or size of the triangle<samp> made)<br/>b. Whoever, gets the most points wins!<br/><br/>4. Obstruction Game<br/><br/>a. While keeping only the movable pieces, transfer all your pieces to another player.<br/>b. When it is your turn, the other player will choose the piece he/she wants you to place onto the board.  (Earn tokens based on the number or size of the triangle<samp> made)<br/>c. When it is the other player&rsquo;s turn, select the piece that would be most disadvantageous for him/her.<br/>d. You can use either of the movable pieces during your turn instead of accepting the other player&rsquo;s pieces.<br/>e. Whoever gets the most points wins!<br/><br/>Scoring<br/><br/>1. Small triangle is worth 1 point each.<br/>2. Large triangle is worth 4 points each.<br/>3. Giant triangle is worth 9 points each.<br/><br/>    It is possible to earn more points by forming multiple triangles in one turn.<br/><br/><br/>",

Actual data of 229 countries and territories - wrapped in 10 games of action and strategy.&quot;<br/><br/>The game comes with 229 cards containing data about various countries. The rulebook contains rules for 10 different games which can be played with the included cards.<br/><br/>1) GeoMundi (2+ players)<br/>This is essentially War. One player chooses a category on the cards (like Literacy). All players compare the value on their card. The player with the best value collects all the cards.<br/><br/>2) GeoMundi Double (2 players)<br/>This is played like GeoMundi, but both players choose a category. One player must win both categories to win the cards. If neither player wins both categories, each draws a new card and chooses a new category. This repeats until a player wins both selected categories and that player then wins all the cards used up to that point.<br/><br/>3) GeoMundi Open (2+ players)<br/>Played like GeoMundi but the lead player selects any of their cards and then chooses any category. Each player may then select any of their cards to use in the battle. Best value in the category wins the cards.<br/><br/>4) Handicap (4+ players on 2+ teams)<br/>Teams take turns. One player on one team picks a card and then must give clues so that their team can guess the name of the country. The clue provider may not use any of the words on the card or give clues related to the country name, although rhymes are allowed.<br/><br/>5) Touch! (2+ players)<br/>This game is similar to Slap Jack. Each player turns over a card on their turn. If two consecutively played cards are for countries which neighbor each other the first player to yell &quot;Touch&quot; wins all the cards in the pile. Islands are &quot;wild&quot; and are considered to touch all other countries.<br/><br/>6) Clue-in (2+ players)<br/>Players decide on an order for the card categories to be used. Players take turns as the clue giver. That player reads the data on the card in the order decided upon. The first player to correctly guess the country name wins the card. Each player is only allowed one guess during each round and if they guess incorrectly the clue giver gets a random card from their stack.<br/><br/>7) Flag Wizz (2+ players)<br/>This is played like Clue-in but only the flag is given as a clue.<br/><br/>8) The Capitals Game (2+ players)<br/>This is played like Clue-in but the players must guess the country's capital city. Or the players can only use the capital city as the clue and the players must guess the country name.<br/><br/>9) Take Your Pick (2+ players)<br/>This is played like Clue-in but the clue giver draws two cards, states the name of each country, and chooses a category. The players must guess which country has the better value or if they match.<br/><br/>10) Map-it<br/>This is played like Clue-in. The clue giver states the name of the country and the first player to find the country on the included map and state the country number wins the card.<br/><br/>",

Wielding a deadly weapon and pure elemental energy, each Hero brings his own unique abilities to bear on one of the monster&rsquo;s vulnerabilities while distinguishing themselves from the other Heroes.<br/><br/>As Heroes unleash their spectacular attacks, the people of the City marvel from across the river. After the battle, Heroes burnish their reputation--and increase their silver--by visiting among the people to increase their renown. After all, real Glory comes from the adoration of the people!<br/><br/>Between the unpredictable attacks, Heroes have downtime to visit the bustle of the City and buy new weapons, learn new abilities, and replenish their elemental energies in preparation for battle.<br/><br/>The Soothseers foretell that the Heroes will vanquish the Colossus after five grueling battles. Though all contribute, only the Hero with the most Glory in both deeds and renown can take credit for the Deathblow and be declared Savior of the City!<br/><br/>Gameplay<br/><br/>Colossal Deathblow is a rules-light, Euro-style, majority control game with unique placement eligibility mechanisms. There are three main phases in each of the its five rounds.<br/><br/>First, while preparing for the Colossus attack during each round (and while the outcome of each battle is still uncertain), players must make hard choices about which of the majority-control areas on the board they might want to use in a later phase.<br/><br/>Second, during the attack, players secretly choose which vulnerability of the Colossus to target using one of their weapons, and which type and how much elemental energy to use to boost the damage. Players are then ranked according to the amount of overall damage they do to the Colossus. The player who does the most damage goes first during the next phase, but also becomes a target when the Colossus strikes back.<br/><br/>Finally, after the battle, players must decide where to place popularity tokens from their limited supply, subject to their eligibility decided earlier. Tokens represent renown, which is converted to VPs (Glory) via majority control at the end of the game.<br/><br/>While players can choose to place as many or as few tokens as they wish during a round, choices are final and there is a hard limit to the number of tokens they can place over the course of the game. Deciding when to double-down to gain a majority and when to conserve tokens are major considerations during each round.<br/><br/>The game is medium-weight and plays in 75-120 minutes, and (despite the impression the name might give) has minimal direct player interaction. It thematically combines the deliciously agonizing choices of classic area control and hand management games (El Grande, Auction 2002) with resource management and simultaneous action selection mechanisms.<br/><br/>",

        "description": "This is a late-WWI or early post-war German game depicting the struggle for Verdun. The game board shows an oblique overhead view from the south of the town and citadel of Verdun, surrounded by hills, forts and batteries, and with airships floating over the distant northern horizon. The game appears to be one of point-to-point manoeuver, but the rules are not clear from the board alone.<br/><br/>The playing grid consists of 36 numbered Forts or Batteries joined by a number of straight black lines (from 3 to a maximum of 8 leading to Fort de Belrupt. Each of these defensive positions is numbered from 1 to 12. The numbers are shown in groups of three, starting with three number 1s on Fort de Houdainville, Fort de Pozellier and a battery in between in the southeast corner of the map. These connect to three number 2s to the north, and so on, circling Verdun in a web of lines in a counter-clockwise direction.<br/><br/>While the place names are in French, and no publisher or date is indicated, the board bears the phrase &quot;Gesetzlich gesch&uuml;tzt&quot; (legally protected), indicating a German manufacturer. Also the back of the square board has four smaller game boards, a chess/checkers board and three named Festung, M&uuml;hle (Nine men's morris) and Wolf, suggesting that this was part of a Spielmagazin or box of games.<br/><br/>",

        "description": "Krona is an abstract board game played on a infinite square grid. You can use the Go board or play with a set of stones (checkers) on any flat surface. The goal of the game is to deprive the opponent of all available moves. To do this, you need to block all the stones of the opposite color. In this game there is no war or direct confrontation of pieces. All the stones are interconnected and constantly depend on each other. During the game, the position passes through various metamorphoses and, having exhausted all its energy, freezes as a result. This game is inspired by the ancient philosophy of the Far East...<br/><br/>You can play with:<br/><br/>16 stones - If you prefer quick tactical games. <br/>36 stones - If you like the balance of tactics and strategy. <br/>64 stones - If you have a worthy opponent and a lot of time.<br/><br/>Average game length - 100-110 plies (with 36 stones). Strategy is more important than tactics. The first player has no advantages. The game can begin with any compact arrangement of stones. You can play with a handicap, if necessary. It is possible to eliminate draws by changing one rule. Connectedness of the position and irreversibility of the game is the basis of krona.<br/><br/>Rules:<br/><br/>Each player has an allocated color, Black and White. Players alternate turns, starting with Black. The stones must all stay connected in a single group. You cannot pick up a stone to move if doing so disconnects the remaining stones, even if they would be reconnected after putting the stone into its new location. Each stone always has neighbors. Their number can be from 1 to 8. Stones are considered to be neighbors if they stand on the nearby squares. Neighbors are divided into two types - diagonal and orthogonal. The stone can be moved to any empty square, where the number of neighbors are less than it is now. Their color does not matter. The stone can also be moved to any empty square, where the number of neighbors does not change, but orthogonal ones among them become less. The game ends when one of the players has no legal moves on his turn. If his opponent also has no moves it's a draw. If he has any move, he wins the game. In this case, the winner does as many moves as he can and earns one point for each move.<br/><br/>",

The primary goal for all players is to cross the finish line (or to be as close as possible to it by the time someone else does). There are a number supplementary scoring metrics involving simple accumulation and set collection. So finishing first, while important, does not guarantee the win.<br/><br/>In each round of the game, all players simultaneously play 2 of their control cards face down. These cards &quot;program&quot; the movements of their vehicles. Cards are then simultaneously revealed, after which each player takes a turn to resolve their vehicle movement, activate powerups, and fire weapons.<br/><br/>Death Race has 2 modes of play: a symmetrical mode in which all vehicles have 9 identical control cards, and an asymmetric mode in which each vehicle has 4 or 5 (of 9) cards that give it unique abilities.<br/><br/>",

The publisher offers an English title 'Mistress Dominating Royal' but a more literal translation would be 'The Inner Palace Insurrection Chronicles'.<br/><br/>The subtitle ～利用せよ、出し抜け、結果得るのは、敵意、そして、権勢なり～ translates as ~ Manipulate, outmanoeuvre, and reap what you sow, all in the name of enmity and influence ~.<br/><br/>Koukyuu Gekokujouki is a set collection game that involves penalties, designed for players who are looking for a sense of satisfaction from their game play.

The kingdom is overrun by a rabble of consorts at the present... but from this rabble there are those who scheme to manipulate others in possession of power, outmanoeuvre their rivals, and expand their control over the Inner Palace.<br/><br/>Players become consorts of the Imperial Court, vying for influence over the Inner Palace.

        "description": "Politics: The Debate is a card game for would-be political leaders. Players take on the role of politicians and try to convince each other they, and they alone, can solve socio-political issues. If you enjoy debating fiscal responsibility one turn, and the feasibility of solving homelessness by imprisoning the homeless the next, The Debate is the game for you.<br/>Players begin by separating and shuffling the two decks &ndash; ISSUES and POLCIES. The issues deck should be placed face-down on the table, and each player takes five policy cards to form a hand. The youngest player starts as the dealer, and they turn over the top issue card. This represents a particular problem that all the players, as politicians, want to look like they can solve. Players do this by playing two Policy cards from their hand. Each player does this going clockwise around the group, starting with the player after the dealer. Each player plays his/her two cards and explains briefly (30ish seconds) how the two Policies they have played solve the particular issue.<br/>After each player has played his/her two Policies, players debate each other in a calm and collected fashion, gently critiquing each other&rsquo;s policies while defending their own. When that&rsquo;s done, go for the jugular &ndash; mercilessly attack your opponent&rsquo;s stupid policies, compare them unfavourably to your fiscally-sound utopian masterplan, and suggest they&rsquo;re like Hitler somehow. Maybe bite someone. When this is done, vote for a winner &ndash; the player whose Policies were the best. Remember to vote for the player who did the best at explaining, justifying and defending their Policies &ndash; not the player who suggested Policies closest to your personal ideology.<br/>Once you&rsquo;ve voted, take a note of the score and continue. The player to the left of the dealer becomes the new dealer, he or she deals two new policy cards to the player (bringing their hand back up to five), and turns over a new issue card. The whole horrible mess goes on like this until players either run out of issues or, if they want to reshuffle the issues and keep playing, until a pre-defined end time (or when you&rsquo;ve had enough). Then the player with the most points is declared winner. Players should take this time to congratulate him/her, and re-visit contentious debates from the game.<br/><br/>",

It is divided into four quadrants: blue, yellow, green and red. Each quadrant has spaces for three of the store's departments on the track, an elevator space inside the track, and a cashier's desk outside the track.<br/><br/>Players spin and move around the track. When they land on a department, they must go to that quadrant's elevator. There they stay until they spin one of three numbers, which then move them to a department either ahead or behind the one they left. A player landing on the same space as another bumps that player to the cashier's desk for the quadrant, from which he can move to the beginning of the quadrant with a spin of 3, or to the end of the quadrant with a 6.<br/><br/>No goods are actually bought or sold: the game is simply a race from the entrance to the exit with goods as distractions along the way.<br/><br/>The game board is of thin cardboard, and was given away in an envelope rather than a box.<br/><br/>",

As with most such games, players are dealt an initial hand, and on their turn, ask a question of their neighbour to the left. If that person answers correctly, he keeps the card; if not, other players in turn have an opportunity, and if no one can answer, the questioning player keeps the card. The player with the most cards at the end of the game wins.<br/><br/>Most of the 180 cards in this game bear one or more title words (names, places, things or events) followed by two or more related facts. For these cards, the questioner states a title word or phrase, and the other players must state one relevant fact.<br/><br/>The remaining cards have specific questions, which players must answer completely. (For example: &quot;Name the features of the Omnibus Bill. The 5-part answer: California should be a free state; Utah and New Mexico should be formed into territories; Texas should be paid $10 million to give up its claim to New Mexico; the Slave Trade should be prohibited in the District of Columbia; and Fugitive slaves should be returned to their owners.)<br/><br/>According to Annual Reports of the Department of the Interior, 1884 this game has 200 cards.<br/><br/>",

        "description": "Orthoepy, which means the study of correct pronunciation, is an educational card game published in Chicago in 1899. It consists of two numbered decks each of 50 cards. One of these decks has Sentence cards, each with six numbered sentences; the other deck has the matching Master cards, showing the proper pronunciation of each difficult word in the sentences.<br/><br/>The rules provide several variations of the game. In the most basic, the Social Game, each deck is distributed evenly among the players. In turn, each player calls out the number of a Master card in his hand. The player holding the corresponding Sentence card then must slowly and distinctly read the sentence on that card of the Master's choice. If the Master player notices any mistakes, he must confirm what the Sentence player said, and then claims the pair of cards as a &quot;book&quot;; if he notices no mistakes, then the reading player gets the cards. Play then passes to the left, and the player with the most &quot;books&quot; when the cards run out is the winner.<br/><br/>The deck includes an Arbiter card, with whoever holds it being empowered to decide any disputes. In the Commercial game, the Arbiter card initially counts as a single point, and failed cards go to the Arbiter and count to his score. However, if the Arbiter makes a mistake, the Arbiter card goes to the successful Master player, and its value increases by one.<br/><br/>In the Professional game, the number of points won is equal to the number of test words correctly pronounced rather than the number of cards; a player missing even a single word scores nothing while the Master gets all the points for the sentence. This introduces an element of strategy for Masters: whether to challenge a given Reader with a long and difficult sentence that could mean a big swing one way or the other, or to choose a short and easier one with less risk and less reward. There are additional rules for Club play and Contests.<br/><br/>",

You battle against your opponent by customizing your memory-lost characters by injecting various memories (words). Hence, the same character may be altered to execute different effects and abilities. First one to put your opponents' life to 0 wins the battle.<br/><br/>It's a Print and Play cardgame, supported by a custom website. A player can create a free account, and keep cards they gain on their personal page. Every 8 hours, each player receives a free Gacha giving a random card. But players can also buy a Premium Gacha giving five extra cards, including more rarites. Since the game is entirely PnP, buying cards is the only cost (an income model akin to mobile games) other than printing.<br/><br/>Gameplay is in quick 1 vs 1 deck-driven battles but the rules enable partnership games. Players tune up their decks with new cards they have collected and printed.<br/><br/><a target='_blank' href=\"https://www.cwm-memories.com/\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer noopener\">https://www.cwm-memories.com/</a><br/><br/>A Note on the Name: Japanese tend to use the L as an approximation to the R which they don't have. This is intentional, not a mistake. So this game would be spoken in Japanese more as Memorion than Memolion, which comes from the game's theme of lost memories.<br/><br/>Publisher's summary<br/>記憶を失ったキャラクターに様々な記憶(ワード)を入れ能力をカスタマイズしながら戦うファンタジーカードゲームです。<br/>同じカードでも違った効果、能力にすることができます。<br/>先に相手のライフを0にしたプレイヤーの勝利です。<br/><br/>プリントして遊べるカードゲームです。<br/><a target='_blank' href=\"https://www.cwm-memories.com/\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer noopener\">https://www.cwm-memories.com/</a><br/>上のサイトに無料会員登録すれば8時間に1回無料でパックを引くことができ、それをマイページに保管することができます。<br/>そこにアクセスすれば好きなカードが印刷できます。<br/><br/>",

        "description": "Visions is a competitive game where the players collect cards that show clocks. They play the clocks to connect other cards via the hands of the clocks with their mental center. Those other cards represent different topics which belong to family Yates: ancestors, places where they lived, rooms where they used to be and their collection of jewels. While the players are visionary talented people, they try to help family Yates finding out what curse lies on them.<br/><br/>By connecting the family cards at the right time (represented by the clock cards) with their mental center the players gain victory points, visionary power and vision parts in different colors. Each player has got a vision card with a 3x3 pattern where they place the vision parts according to the rules. The players get victory points for full rows and columns.<br/><br/>The players may use the visionary power to change it into benefits, for example reducing the cost to connect family cards with the mental center or getting additional vision parts.<br/>At a given time the player with the fewest victory points chooses a sort of visionary power and all benefits which are connected to this power will be more expensive for the rest of the game and all players have to deal with this limitation.<br/><br/>One family card lies at a special position and can't be connected directly with the mental center but it is possible to connect the card through the other family cards with the center to get the benefits and the chance to force other players to swap vision parts and/or visionary power.<br/><br/>The players also have to try to solve a master vision with the vision parts to get extra points and offer the best help for family Yates. Only the one with the most victory points is able to give them the chance to break the curse.<br/><br/>",

Extra! is an educational children's game, designed to teach players to distinguish between fact and opinion.  Players start the game with five newspaper tokens each.  On a turn, they choose a card, read the passage on the card and then attempt to answer the associated question.  Correct answers allow the player to roll a die and move.  Wrong answers cause loss of a turn.  Players attempt to land on purple spaces, which are attached to houses and allow them to &quot;deliver&quot; one of their newspapers.  However, they may not deliver to a house that already has a paper.  A few spaces contain special instructions, such as extra turns or moves or loss of turns or taking a paper back.

You can use your faction specific player mat to organize your cards during game play. The faction specific counter is used to mark your score on the battle mat.<br/><br/>Unplayed vehicle cards can be organized above the player mat in the &quot;docks&quot; area either face up or face down (I play face down so my opponent has to remember which vehicles I've played). The unplayed action cards are shuffled and placed face down on the left side of the mat; you will randomly draw from this deck as you play. The fighter deck will usually be in your hand but you can set it in the middle of the mat to keep things organized. Lastly, each player will have 4 action cards in his/her hand, store these on the right side of the mat. The bottom portion of the mat will fill up with won or discarded cards as you play.<br/><br/>The player who initiates combat will choose 1 fighter card and 1 vehicle card from his player mat and place them in play near the battle mat.  Add the power scores from each card and place your faction's counter on the corresponding number on the battle mat. The next player will do the same, placing one fighter card and one vehicle card in play and adding his faction's counter to the mat. After all fighter and vehicle cards are played, in order, each player will place an action card face down. Once all action cards are committed to play they are flipped over to reveal their modifiers.<br/><br/>",

Each article has a hidden value revealed after its purchase by the Highest Bidder. If the buyer purchases the article at less than the revealed value, he scores a profit. If he pays more than it's worth, he loses the difference. The winner of the game is the player with the highest amount of money remaining after all articles are auctioned off.<br/><br/>Before play begins each player secretly decides what each article being auctioned is worth and writes the dollar amount on a slip of paper and then inserts the paper into the article envelope. Each player begins with $1,179 and uses this money to bid on articles placed at auction.<br/><br/>The &quot;auctioneer&quot; title is passed from player to player and the number of items auctioned per auctioneer turn is determined by the number of players (articles should be divided up so each player has an equal number to auction off. The game instructions use groups of five). After each item is auctioned, the article envelope is opened and the slips are totaled. The auctioneer acts a the bank and either collects money from the bidder if the amount bid is more than the revealed value or pays the bidder if the revealed value is more than the amount bid.<br/><br/>",

It is based in the Project Touhou universe, with character cards representing various characters from the Project Touhou universe, drawn by many different artists (see below). <br/><br/>The game box contains 8 dice, 54 characters cards (6 x 9 characters) and 6 rules summary cards.<br/><br/>The players all start with the Daiyousei character card. They take turns at rolling dice.<br/><br/>More specifically, a player's turn consists of:<br/>1. You throw initially 3 dice<br/>2. You may use as many character cards you have in your possession to tweak that initial roll. The effects could be to change the dice value or add more dice for instance.<br/>3. After modification, if you achieve a specific condition you can get a new character card which you will be able to use at your next run. Now your turn ends.<br/><br/>The game continues until a player manages to get the Flandre character card.<br/><br/>Note: The rulebook is in Japanese but no Japanese is needed for playing the game as the cards only have symbols (dice sides and numbers).<br/><br/>Publisher's summary:<br/><br/>Twist your　'Fate' !<br/><br/>You think it's over? But it's not !<br/>Add dice, remove dice, use spells to alter your luck and be the first to rejoin with Flandre !<br/><br/>運命を捻じ曲げろ！<br/><br/>賽は投げられた？関係ないね！<br/>ダイス目を増やし、減らし、逆転させフランドールの元まで辿りつけ！<br/><br/>カレーラーメンのカードゲーム第二弾『運命力』！<br/>今度はひたすらダイスを振りまくるゲームです。<br/><br/>",

This is strictly a die-rolling game, albeit also asymmetrical.<br/><br/>The board is a rectangular sheet of paper showing six artillery pieces behind earthworks firing at a multi-turreted castle. The castle walls are marked with 28 combinations of 2D6, some duplicated, while four piles of rocks in front of the castle are marked with doubles 1 through 4. (The main gates are marked with doubles 5 and 6.)<br/><br/>Above the castle are six spaces decorated with artillery pieces, each with a single 2D6 combination, and empty squares covering the rest of the possibilities. Players roll 2D6 alternately, and to win, the attacking player must destroy all the segments of the castle before the defending player rolls the six combinations needed to destroy his guns.<br/><br/>The game name and publication date of 1840 are handwritten on the reverse of the game sheet.<br/><br/>",

        "description": "Description from the designer:<br/><br/>War: the Board Game is an abstract wargame which captures the most difficult strategic and tactical decisions faced by generals in a war with a minimum set of rules that can be explained in less than 5 minutes. The design is effectively a deconstruction of the concept of a wargame, removing all ornament and unnecessary layers of complexity in order to retain only its essence. Despite its parsimonious nature, in War: The Board Game players face situations that can be considered direct representations of the reality in warfare. They need to protect the supply lines and headquarters, capture prisoners, flank and surround enemies, take advantage of geographical features etc.<br/><br/>The strategic depth of the game and the absence of in-game randomness, aims at rewarding experienced players. However, the learning curve is not steep and the millions of possible situations in the game make almost impossible to master it completely. Each games plays very differently depending on the type of strategy players attempt. Games can be very short if both opponents play very offensively or longer if they adopt a more conservative defensive strategy. As in reality, War: the Board Game can be won sometimes by a blitz attack or by attrition warfare.<br/><br/>Although War: the Board Game is a game with open information, the randomized initial setup and the addition of special rules for each scenario (e.g. antiquity wars, WWI, WWII, etc.) make the game replayable ad infinitum and avoid the problem of players memorizing and replicating standard initial moves and tactics. Moreover, the special scenario rules not only add thematic flavor to the game, but also introduce an different spatial element and make much more difficult to predict enemy's actions.<br/><br/>War: the Board Game is language independent and can be played 1 vs 1, 2 vs 2 (Allies) or 4 players (free for all). The Allies (2 vs 2) version of the game adds an extra twist and new strategic and tactical options. Allies version can be also playable by 2 or 3 players (1 vs 2) if players want to control two armies and headquarters.<br/><br/>",

In Elemental Piggies you get to do just that!<br/><br/>HOW TO PLAY<br/>This game is about beating your opponent's pigs with pigs that counter the ones in place without being able to look at the opponents card, you will have to just trust them or call them out on their lie. However if you falsely accuse someone of lying you are the one that takes the cards.<br/><br/>Each player gets 10 cards. On each card are a number of piggies with an elemental affiliation: water, fire, wind, void and earth. One element beats another or you can overpower a card with the number of pigs in the card.<br/><br/>Players place their cards in the middle of the table and try to beat the value of the card that was previously placed. If they can't beat the value, they must take the pile.<br/><br/>HOW TO WIN<br/>Play cards with pigs and elements and the first to get rid of all of their cards wins!<br/><br/>",

The second type also uses only infantry, but with deterministic chess-like moves and no dice. The third type adds all the other types of units. The goal in all games is to capture the flag in the enemy capital or reduce the enemy army to less than half of the own army's size.<br/><br/>Included in the game are miniature armies for Germany and France allowing for a two-player game on a war between those two nations fought on land only. Expansion armies for 15 other European countries were sold separately as well as expansions adding navies for 12 of the nations.<br/><br/>The rules recommend playing with one player per major country, but that two players play Germany as a team if fighting a two-front war against both France and Russia.<br/><br/>",

You play one of the surviving scientists who must collect pieces of floating research tech and combine them into Electromagnetic-, Gravity-, and Time-bending tools to help bring Chronomega One back under control. You have no idea which member of the crew is responsible for the emergency protocol lock-down and crew ejection, so you can&rsquo;t trust any of them!<br/><br/>The player's goal is to collect a full set of the three types of Computer cards (all values 1, 2, 3) to unlock the Station Key Code, and reach the central Computer portal of the station first (and in advanced play, before the station explodes).<br/><br/>The game utilizes a rotating space station board and transparent hexagonal tech cards that represent the four 'suits' of the game, Electromag, Gravity, Chrono, and Computer. The players get three actions each turn to move about the board or play cards. They'll want to collect the floating tech cards during their turn and utilize them for different effects. All the tech cards consist of one of the four suits and are valued 1-3.<br/><br/>If a player encounters another player on the board, they'll utilize their tech cards to engage in a showdown. This consists of each player bidding one of their tech cards. The bids are then revealed and winner determined based on the tech suit played. Certain types of tech defeat others: Electro defeats Grav, Grav defeats Chrono, Chrono defeats Electro. If two types of the same suit are played, higher values defeat lower. All suits defeat Computer, unless their values match (e.g. Grav 3 vs Computer 3), in which case the Computer suit player wins. The winner takes the card that was bid and may push the opposing player 3 spaces (if in outer space), or up or down one level of the space station (including out into an airlock).<br/><br/>All tech cards have a basic function they may be played for as an action, such as move an extra space or to force another player to discard cards. Two transparent tech cards also may be combined and over-layed to activate a catalytic effect, which grants different powers based on the combined card's values and suits. If a full three-part set of tech cards are collected of the same suit (values 1, 2, and 3 of a single suit) they form a POD. These grant the most significant abilities in the game. The more powerful card effects require the player to be standing upon an appropriate research portal to use, either one of the permanent portals within the rotating space station or from a floating portal out in space that they cobbled together from another high-value tech card of the same suit.<br/><br/>The space station itself is surrounded by trapped airlocks which make simply entering the station a risky endeavor. While inside, every time a player ends a turn within the space station their ring level rotates 90 degrees, lining up different portals and pathways with the inter-level Grav chutes. Furthermore, other players may cobble together Electro catalyzers from floating tech cards to try and teleport players into other areas of the station, spend Grav tech to pull cards away from other players, or utilize Chrono tech cards to cause the addition or loss of turns and actions.<br/><br/>Once a player with a full hand of Computer cards reaches the inner Computer Portal of the station, they deactivate Chronomega One&rsquo;s self-destruct sequence and win the game.<br/><br/>",

Played on a play area with 151 hexagonal squares, of which 139 can be conquered. Each player receives three tokens and 100 field marks. The game is turn-based. Each turn consists of the following four phases:<br/> 1. Move 2. Draw commands-cards 3. Capture by rolling 4. Capture by commands,<br/> which are always played in this order.<br/>When a player has completed his turn, the second player has his turn. This is repeated until one of the players has won the game mode determined by both players at the beginning. <br/>The player has to move each of his token one field every turn. He rooling the dice for each token and destinkt so how many fields he can conquer surround his token. If the player roll a five he can conquer or free five fields.   <br/>The player conquer free fields or free conquered fields. If a field with a token is conquerd, the token go back to the spawn.  <br/>Each time a player move on one of the 12 fields with a star (wich can not be conquerd) he has to draw a command-card.<br/>With this command-cards he can supply for example his movement, instead of one movement turn per token he has by playing the command &quot;move +1&quot; two turns for one token. The command-cards are very different. Some have supply effects for the movement other supply the conquering and others are traps with negative effects. Some of the command-cards ask the player to roll the dice. For example how many fields a player lose by drawing a trap-card.<br/>Some commands (max 5)can be collected in the &quot;depot&quot; and played as a chain.<br/><br/>There is also an assist app available in Google Playstore<br/><br/>",

        "description": "This is a two-player German war game published in about 1880. The playing board features a castle in the center surrounded by a two-layer multi-colored track running from 1-70. On each side is rectangular block of colored numbers, with 1-35 on one side and 36-70 on the other. There are illustrations of fighting in the four corners, with uniforms representing the then-recent Franco-Prussian war of 1870-71.<br/><br/>To start, the players each put an agreed amount into the pot to fund the war. They then take turns rolling a single die, and advancing that many spaces on their respective tracks. The first to reach space 70 wins the war and the pot.<br/><br/>The color of each space has an effect on play. If a player lands on a green space, the opponent must drop back to the nearest red space. A player who lands on a blue space must pay one mark to his opponent. Landing on a gold space means paying a mark into the pot, while landing on a lilac space grants another roll of the die.<br/><br/>The board consists of a sheet of paper pasted onto thick cardboard. A second game is pasted onto the reverse side.<br/><br/>",

        "description": "Zuirius is a strategic board game played on an endless triangular grid. It is possible to play on any flat surface, without the special board. The goal of the game is to block all tetrahedrons of your rival.<br/><br/>In this game there is no captures or direct confrontation of pieces. During the game the number of pieces is not changed, all tetrahedrons are interconnected and constantly depend on each other. The compact starting position of pieces passes through various irreversible metamorphoses and, having exhausted all its &quot;energy&quot;, freezes as a result. You can play with 18, 24, 30, 36 or 42 pieces. The more pieces, the harder the game will be.<br/><br/>Rules:<br/><br/>Each player has an allocated color. Players alternate turns. All tetrahedrons must be connected in a single group. You cannot pick up a piece to move if doing so disconnects the remaining pieces, even if they would be reconnected after putting the piece into its new location. Each tetrahedron always has neighbors. Their number can be from 1 to 12. Tetrahedrons are considered to be neighbors if they stand on the nearby triangles. Neighbors are divided into two types - orthogonal and diagonal. The piece can be moved to any empty triangle, where the number of neighbors are less than it is now. Their color does not matter. The piece can also be moved to any empty triangle, where the number of neighbors does not change, but orthogonal ones among them become less. The game ends when one of the players has no legal moves on his turn. In this case, the winner does as many moves as he can and earns one point for each move. When both players lose moves consecutively it's a draw.<br/><br/>",

The game board features only the illustrations and symbols for each city, not the names. Players are encouraged to read the booklet before starting the game.<br/><br/>The stock of small red and black letter tiles is placed in a bag or opaque bowl, and players take turns drawing blind, one tile at a time until a red letter tile is drawn. The player drawing the red tile must place it as the initial letter of one of the cities. After that, the player may place as many black letters in his hand as possible that continue the spelling of any city name that has been started with a red letter.<br/><br/>Play then passes to the left. Each player in turn first draws another tile from the stock and then places as many letters as possible. If a player draws a red letter, he must place it immediately. If he is unable to identify a suitable city, he must place the letter in front of him, after which the first player to call &quot;Halt&quot; may take and play the letter, and then continue his turn. Play then passes left from the seizing player.<br/><br/>Players must continue to draw a letter at the beginning of each turn, even if they have no tiles left. The winner is the player who first uses up all his tiles after the last tile has been drawn from the stock.<br/><br/>The map board includes Vienna, Graz, Prague and the major cities of occupied Poland as German, but still shows Denmark as independent, meaning it was based on the borders as they stood between October 1939 and April 1940.<br/><br/><br/>",

        "description": "In トーテムのこころ (Spirit of Totem), players attempt to create a totem pole from cards before anyone else. Most cards depict one or three color-coded spirit icons at the top of the card, with the colors being repeated at the bottom of the card as well; a few cards picture a thunderbird, and these cards are used to top a totem or cast a spell.<br/><br/>Each player starts with two cards in hand, and on a turn first draws one card, then plays or discards one card. When they play a totem card, they can start a totem or add to a totem &mdash; but when adding to a totem at least one of the colored marks on the card being added must be placed in the same column as the card being covered, even if this means the card being placed doesn't line up exactly with the card below. If the top card shows red, yellow, blue, and you want to add a yellow, brown, blue, then you can line up the yellow marks or the blues, but not both.<br/><br/>When a player plays a thunderbird, they can cast one of the four spells in play, after which that spell is placed face down until all four spells have been cast, after which they're all revealed once again. The spells are &quot;Wind blows left/right&quot;, &quot;Zap&quot;, and &quot;Gift&quot;. The caster of the wind spell chooses a height above the first level, then all cards at the level and above are shifted one column left or right, depending on the wind. If parts of a totem have no support, then those cards are discard. Zap removes the top card in a player's totem, and Gift requires each player to pass one card in hand left and the other right.<br/><br/>As soon as a totem consists of at least four cards and the top card is centered with the bottom card (regardless of the positioning of the intervening cards), the player can top the totem with a thunderbird card to win the game. If the player has an earth totem on top &mdash; that is, a card showing the same spirit icon in all three spots, then the totem doesn't need to be aligned to be topped with a thunderbird.<br/><br/>トーテムのこころ (Spirit of Totem) also includes rules for solo play, with the player needing to build totems of 7, 8, 9, and 10 cards without the use of spells in order to win.<br/><br/>",

The games are educational and aimed at the 3 - 8 age group.<br/><br/>In brief, it is a game to help small children read and count, usually solo but can be played with 2 or 3.<br/><br/>Each player takes a card and tries to read the letters on it (ABC) part, these start with three letters and are common objects such as B-E-E or C-A-T and go up from there depending on the age of the child.<br/><br/>The winner is the first player to get to a set number of correct answers, dependent on the age of the children. The track is a straight box divided into 12 squares for each color / team / player. Can be dependent on age so that younger children don't need to get as far as older ones.<br/><br/>On the 123 side each card has a number on it and picture of say 2 Dogs or 4 mice.<br/><br/>",

Armies made up of the remnants of world powers are making a last stand in this semi Co-operative Resource management, engine building, with area control and dice combat game. <br/>Take to the air in experimental German planes, Use submarines to avoid detection from roaming dragons.<br/><br/>Three Dragons including the Mother are randomly placed on three major cities.<br/><br/>Players select their army and determine start order.<br/>There is a card drafting phase where certain number of cards are drawn and the last player in turn order gets first pick of the cards and then passes to next turn ordered player and then back to them where everyone gets to keep two cards.<br/>Now it is first players turn. They have a number of actions based on the number of Generals they started with. Each general can give one order Explore/Move, Mine, Sell/Trade, Build, Attack or Draw a Card. Early emphasis is on gathering resources to develop weapons and vehicles. Players will explore the globe and mine by flipping hex tiles. The revealed mine may have gold, oil, metal, uranium or it may be a dragon cave and unleash a new dragon. The new dragon will immediately fly around the board. It's direction will be dictated by a 4 sided die. It will only stop when it reaches a city or player who will have to fight it. If too many cities are captured the game immediately ends and all players lose.<br/><br/>As player armies start to get stronger it is advised that these players team up to start hunting dragons whose carcasses are a plethora of new resources: Scales, Blood and Hydrogen allowing very unique upgrade abilities. If the dragon had a city base, victorious players can turn over the tiles and reap the benefits.<br/><br/>Once players become strong enough they will attempt to defeat the Mother Dragon. If they poses a hydrogen or atom bomb they can do so but by destroying city they will not reap the treasures.  The city being lost may also cost them the game if the limit is met. Once all dragons are destroyed players count their active mining territories, cities and gold to find out who is the new world super power and ultimate winner.<br/><br/>",

        "description": "This is a dice-throwing gambling game with a fairly elaborate board. The board consists of a 100-space track divided into three areas.<br/><br/>The outer ring consists of 26 squares around the edge of the board, each showing the flag of a German royal realm, princedom, grand duchy or duchy, as well as those of the free cities Lubeck, Bremen and Hamburg and the (recently conquered) territory of Alsace-Lorraine. The second ring consists of small squares numbered 27-82 in a variety of colors including light and dark blue, red, green, yellow and white. The final ring is a circle numbered 83-99 which sits at the center of the board flanked on either side by soldiers on horseback and above and below by the rules. The 100 space is a coat of arms in the middle of the circle.<br/><br/>Players each start with the same amount of money and put an agreed sum into the pot. They take turns rolling a single die to move along the track. Players need to know the ranks of the various flags: they receive 3 marks from the pot when landing on a royal or duchy space, but must put 3 marks into the pot when landing on a princedom or grand duchy. The free city squares have no effect. Landing on the same space as another player also has no effect.<br/><br/>Landing on Alsace-Lorraine (12) or on the squares 30, 40, 50, 60 or 70 means going back to square 1 and starting over. A player who runs out of money is no longer allowed to play. Whoever gets to the 100 space first collects the pot.<br/><br/>",

        "description": "Tarabish, also known by its slang term Bish, is a trick-taking card game of complex rules derived from Belote, a game of the Jass family. The actual pronunciation of the name is &quot;tar-bish&quot;, even though it can be spelled &quot;tarabish&quot;. It is played primarily by the people of Cape Breton, Nova Scotia, in Canada, where it was brought in 1901 by a Lebanese immigrant George Shebib.<br/><br/>The game is over when one or both teams accumulate 500 points or more. Points are counted at the end of each hand and both teams always count their points. The team with the most points at the end of the game wins.<br/><br/>A Tarabish deck consists of a normal deck of playing cards with the 2 through 5 of each suit removed. In preparation for the hand the dealer shuffles the cards in the usual manner. When finished the person to the right of the dealer cuts the cards. The cut must leave at least four cards in each portion of the deck. Once the cards have been cut, no further shuffling is allowed.<br/><br/>The 36 Tarabish cards are dealt in groups of three beginning to the left of the dealer and proceeding clockwise until all the cards are passed out. The four players look at their first six cards; the last three, called the kitty, remain face down until after the bid is complete and a trump suit has been chosen.<br/><br/>Cards value<br/>The cards have a strict point value in trumps:<br/><br/>J = 20 points<br/>9 = 14 points<br/>A = 11 points<br/>10 = 10 points<br/>K = 4 point<br/>Q = 3 point<br/>8 7 6 = no value<br/>The order and value in a non-trump suit are:<br/><br/>A = 11 points<br/>10 = 10 points<br/>K = 4 points<br/>Q = 3 points<br/>J = 2 points<br/>9 8 7 6 = no value<br/><br/>",

Random effects through the drawing of event cards will also occur.

        "description": "In the timeless realm of the Greek gods, Zeus reigns supreme. His resentful brothers, Hades and Poseidon, often find themselves bored, and squabble about their lesser status. To settle matters, albeit temporarily, they occasionally wager on events in the human sphere. On this day, they&rsquo;re betting for boasting rights on three separate races: a Greek chariot race c. 350 BC, a trail run in present-day Idaho, USA, and a space-faring contest at light-speed in the year 4017. Naturally, the sneaky duo will try to influence the outcome of the contests, while Zeus keeps a watchful eye on their activities.<br/><br/>Wager of the Gods is unique in that players will simultaneously need to manage three distinct races, each with its own rigors and pitfalls. Movement is generated by multi-numbered chit draw; these numbers must be allocated to each of the three game boards. Naturally there are occasional special actions -- and just the right amount of strategy for a tense and fun two-player game. The player who wins two of the three races wins the day!<br/><br/>Components:<br/><br/>&bull;  3 Game Boards<br/>&bull; 70 Action Counters<br/>&bull;  6 Player Tokens in two colors<br/>&bull;  4 Galaxy Counters<br/>&bull;  8 Whip Counters<br/>&bull;  6 Ram Counters<br/>&bull;  1 Dolphin Counter <br/>&bull;  2 Reference Cards<br/><br/>",

The cards chosen cards also determine the turn order (the better the actions, the slower you are).

The dealer starts the trading by shouting 'LET'S DO BUSINESS' after which all players may trade cards face down across the table. The first player to collect nine identical CRIME cards shouts 'AVE SOME OF THAT!' to win the round. The winner of the round becomes The GUVNOR and receives a win bonus (PROFIT).

The starting Pin is marked base, and the Game&rsquo;s Goal Pin, obviously at the Peak, is marked top. A player&rsquo;s objective is to reach the TOP by spanning his Metal Traveler from Pin to Pin.<br/><br/>Attached to the board is a Metal Traveler on a string. This Traveler has rings on each side that are used to encircle the Pins on the board. Starting from the base, a player positions his Traveler and encircles another Pin with the other end of his Traveler in order to move and climb to the summit.<br/><br/>The Traveler spans easily to any pin, from pin to pin. A player does not need to force any Traveler span to move.<br/><br/>The player who reaches the top of Pike's Peak first wins the game<br/><br/>",

An example of items on the cards are, A piece of beef, Two little pigs, A pound of candles, A bottle of hair oil, Two spools of cotton and other similar needs of the time to go shopping for.<br/><br/>Three questions are asked to player on his turn.<br/><br/>The first is &lsquo;Where did you go shopping?&rsquo;  The player answers with any place he wants.  He could say &lsquo;I want gone shopping at the Grocer, Butcher, Hardware Store, the Mill, or wherever&rsquo;.  After he answers, he is asked the second question, &lsquo;What did you buy?&rsquo;<br/><br/>This question prompts him to choose one center card.  He reads it, and if he couldn&rsquo;t have purchased the item at the store previously named, he is punished; unless, he can justify it.  For example, if he says he went shopping at the Butcher Shop, surely he did not purchase Two pounds of Yarn there.  However, he may come up with an explanation of how the Butcher&rsquo;s Wife changed her mind on the color of yarn she had purchased earlier, and sold it to them instead of returning it to the store.<br/><br/>If all players agree with the explanation, he is not punished.  The third question is now asked, &lsquo;What do you intend to do with it?&rsquo;  If the player cannot come up with a wise answer, then the player is punished for &lsquo;extravagance&rsquo;.<br/><br/>The winner is the first player who succeeds in plausibly answering all three questions.

The cards comprise of five different types of images.  <br/>There is one card displaying the image of Uncle Ned and one card displaying the image of a Fox.  Then there are 8 Egg cards, 25 Chick cards, and 14 Hen cards.<br/><br/>The game begins by placing the Uncle Ned card in the center of all the players.  Next, an appointed dealer will shuffle and equally distribute the other cards, including the fox card, to all the players.<br/><br/>The cards are stacked face up in front of each player.  The counters are also equally distributed to the players based on their amounts.  Each player should have the same number of cards and equal value of &lsquo;counters&rsquo;.  Players then each place the amount of 10 in counters on Uncle Ned.  He is considered the score-keeper.<br/><br/>The first player spins the indicator and adds the total pointed by both arrows.  If this number is found on the player&rsquo;s top card, he takes the value of 5 in counters from Uncle Ned.  If the number spun does not appear on the player&rsquo;s card, he gives the value of 2 in counters to Uncle Ned. The card is turned over.<br/>The next player then spins, but adds his total to the previous player&rsquo;s total spin, wrapping around at the number 15.  <br/>The winner of the game is the player with the most points/counter values after all cards have been used.<br/><br/>",

The playing board is only seven spaces wide and 14 rows deep, with four 2-space blanks in the middle rows that force attacks to go through the remaining three channels.<br/><br/>The playing pieces are wooden triangles that stand up so only the owning player can see their values. Players set up freely on their side of the board and than move them one at a time to attack opposing pieces and eventually capture the enemy flag piece.<br/><br/>Each side has 33 pieces, ranging in value from 11 (Scharfshutze or Sharpshooter) to 1 (Feldmarschall or Field Marshal). In general, the lower value beats the higher value, with equal values causing mutual destruction. However, the Scharfshutze kills the Feldmarschall while losing to everything else, and Mines kill anything that attacks them, but cannot move or attack.<br/><br/>",

        "description": "Objective of the game<br/><br/>This  is a game to practice languages while a story is created among the players.<br/><br/>Vocabulary Cards<br/><br/>There are vocabulary cards of different colours with words in one foreign language. The cards are classified as pronouns, nouns, adjectives, infinitive verbs, adverbs, and prepositions + conjunctions (in the same group). In each cards there are 6 words numbered from 1 to 6. (There are two possibilities: a game of 900 words (150 vocabulary cards) and a game of 1500 (250 vocabulary cards) words) <br/>There are also TWO dice with six faces<br/>Each player must take one card from each group. Then he rolls the dice for to determinate the number of cards that he can substitute by the word he chose. Then for the others cards, he rolls again the dice and take the word that correspond at number given by the dice. <br/>There is the possibility of using both dices for two determinate the verbal tense used in the sentence. From 1 to 12, each number correspond at one of the most used verbal tens.<br/> Using all these words the player must make one or several sentences in a foreign language, say it out loud and write it in a notebook. You can also leave the sentences sketchy so that the next player finishes them in turn. The cards that have not been used remain for the next turn. The cards used return to the deck.<br/>You can use the words that are already written in the the notebook<br/>If a player has made mistakes, it can be corrected by another player. As a penalty, he will receive from the player that corrected him, one vocabulary card for each mistakes made.<br/>If a player does not understand some words he has picked up or a phrase constructed by another player, he should ask. The answer will be given with gestures or an explanation in the foreign language. The one giving the explanation will give to the other player two vocabulary cards.<br/>Vocabulary cards can be exchanged between players. The player says &quot;exchange&quot; and the cards are placed face up on the table.<br/>Ways to discard vocabulary cards<br/>If an error is made by a player, he receive one card for each mistake.<br/>If an explanation is given, two cards are given<br/>If you sing a song or recite a poem of at least four verses without making a mistake, the player can discard three vocabulary cards. For every mistake, a card is retained.<br/>If the player tells a story, gives a lesson, or a talk, he gets rid of a number of cards equivalent to the minutes that the oral presentation lasted. The other players give him a score between 1 to 10. The player  is allowed to discard the score multiplied by the number of minutes spoken divided by ten.<br/>When a player has  discarded  all his vocabulary cards he moves to the second level.<br/>Text cards<br/>In the second level you play with the text cards. There are 45. In the cards there are indications of the type: <br/><br/>    introduce a fantastic character <br/>    introduce a key discovery<br/>    enter an internal dialogue <br/>    a leap in time<br/>    describe a house <br/>    describe a city <br/><br/><br/> *Introduce a metaphor <br/><br/>    Introduce a comparison <br/><br/><br/>*Introduce a hyperbole ... <br/>There is also a letter that says:&quot; the manuscript has been lost, you must rewrite the story &quot;. And another that says: &quot;write the ending&quot;. When this card comes out, the story is finish and the game is over.<br/>There are 9 wildcards to write paragraphs of text freely.<br/>If the player make mistakes, he will retake vocabulary cards, one for each mistake, and he will  return to the first level where the sentences are constructed.<br/>Who wins<br/>The player that has used all the cards or has less than the others.<br/>There must be among the players a native speaker or teacher of the language, in order to correct the mistakes.<br/>You can consult books of grammar and conjugation<br/>You can choose a winner in creativity<br/>The one who wins has to read the story.<br/><br/>Of course you can practice your own language and use the game just to make up stories<br/> The game is appropriate for player ages 8 to 90.<br/>You can make two different games; one with the vocabulary cards and the other with the text cards. If you play only with the vocabulary cards, then the winner will be the one who gets rid of the cards first. If you play with the text cards, the winner is the one who makes the least mistakes. For each mistake five points are subtracted and 20 are added if there are no mistakes.<br/><br/>",

After the two decks of cards are shuffled, each player is dealt 5 Painter and 5 Artwork Description cards and also selects 5 Detail discs that have been shuffled face down on the table.<br/><br/>Players then take turns playing as many cards and/or discs as possible. Any remaining cards are shuffled back into their respective decks and the discs are mixed face down with the others on the table. The goal is to match one circular Detail disc, one Painter card, and one Artwork Description card for each masterpiece on a player&rsquo;s game board(s). The first player to do so is the winner.<br/><br/>",

Master in influencing people, Takeda is able to make anyone change sides.&quot;<br/><br/>This Mini-Expansion for The Rotfather: Intrigas adds a seventh character to the game. Takeda's abilities increase the &quot;take that&quot; factor of the game, since its individual action serves more to disrupt the strategy of other players than to a direct advantage of the player who uses it. In addition, the increased number of cards allows for seven-player matches without major problems.<br/><br/>",

The players draw cards from a common deck. The cards can help or hurt both teams depending on the correct timing of the actions. Revealing and executing the actions alternately comes next.

Each time a Headquarters is cracked (destroyed) a high value treasure, global effect, or victory point is acquired.  Once all Headquarters have cracked the game ends and the faction with the most victory points can buy their way to freedom!<br/><br/>Each faction in the game has a completely unique set of cards and mechanics to draw upon for victory.  Play style and game focus will depend heavily on the faction chosen, but no faction is &quot;best&quot;.<br/><br/>With a streamlined pool of 12 starting cards and a 5 card hand, fast turnover and card throughput is a staple of Face Off.

These battles were the turning point of the Finnish War of 1808-1809 which would lead to Finland being annexed to Russia for over 100 years. Can you change history?<br/><br/>The Battle of Kuortane is a classical IGO-UGO wargame with an innovative system for melee attacks and defensive fire, to better capture the feeling of the chaotic bayonet charges of the Finnish War. The game features assymetric goals and reinforcement rules which create different playstyles for the Russian and the Swedish-Finnish armies: whereas the Russian player needs to advance carefully but with a determined pace, the Swedish player needs to wait for the perfect moment to pounce with maximum strength to claim victory.<br/><br/>The game is offered as a print-and-play of only two pages: one page for the rules, and one page to mount on cardboard and cut out. No advanced crafting required.<br/><br/>",

Use voting chips and cobbling chips to earn extra points to help you around the board and be the first to reach The famous Rovers Return.<br/><br/>Start the game by deciding if you will play as individuals or in teams and then choose a character mover and place them on the Start space. Each player or team is then given a True or False voting chip and three cobble chips.<br/>Taking it in turn to be the Question Reader, they must pick up a card from the deck in the centre of the board and read out the question. Opponents then need to decide whether the trivia question is true or false and lay their voting chip up the correct way to answer the question. Once all voting chips have been paid down, cobbling can begin.<br/>Cobbling gives players the chance to pick up bonus points to help them move further around the board based on an opponent's true or false answer to the question. If the opponent's answer that you 'bet' your cobble chip on is correct then you get to keep your cobble chip and gain an extra point. But if their answer to the question was wrong and you chose to cobble, then you lose that chip.<br/>Once players complete a full lap of the board and move past the Start space on the board, they can collect a 30 points token. If you pass Start twice, then flip the token over to reveal 60 points.<br/>After the last True or False card is played and all players have moved their character mover the amount of spaces they've earned, the player with the highest score (most 30/60 token points plus the score on the board) is the winner.<br/><br/>",

Your opponent may use certain special cards to negate a Move. <br/>-   Use Attack cards to have a unit attack a target unit at the exact range indicated by the card and do 1 point of damage to the target (when hits are reduced to 0 the unit is destroyed). Your opponent may use Defence cards to reduce hits caused by an Attack.   <br/>3. End Phase<br/>Max hand size is 7 cards. Discard excess cards.<br/><br/>The game is won when a player destroys his opponent&rsquo;s leader (Nutcracker or Mouse King).  The last (killing) hit on a leader unit may only be made by the opposing leader unit.<br/><br/>",

Your goal is to get the other players to &ldquo;+11 Smell&rdquo; and knock them out of the game. It&rsquo;s great for warming up gaming night or at your local watering hole.<br/><br/>How many friends can I play with and how long is an average game?<br/>You can play with 2-4 people, but 3-4 is best. An average game lasts between 15-20 minutes.<br/><br/>How do I play?<br/>Every player starts with 3 cards. Each turn you will draw a card and then play  a card.  There are 3 types of cards: smell, clean and action. Smell cards can only be played on your opponents and clean cards on yourself. Action cards provide a fun turn of events in your favor!<br/><br/>",

Participants race as fast as they can to reach specific checkpoints in time throughout a day and then race back to the moment they left. The racer with the least amount of time missing on his internal clock wins! Beware of other racers on the time track as they can short you out and make you miss your connection! Pick up tricks, weapons, and boosters when successfully hitting your time checkpoints in your silly little time machine! This is a very easy game with lots of fun stuff going on. Totally safe for kids over 4 who don't put random stuff in their mouths. <br/>1-5 Players pick unusual time machines each with their own weapons or abilities and then race around 6 clocks using a 13 spaced spinner and 2 dice. Players pick up boosters as they lock in checkpoints in time and try not to be lost in the fabric of time and space by shorting out. Depending on the number of players short out limits can be 3-6. If a player completely shorts out all acquired checkpoints and cards are lost and the player must pick a new time machine card to start over.<br/><br/>Booster cards are acquired by locking in a checkpoint each player has the chance to collect a total of 5 of these in a game and they can give the user special weapons, advancements, or tricks. After all players have locked in a checkpoint time wraith tokens are placed on the five outer clocks. These devil drivers are trying to catch you. Some are good and some are bad. The spinner is used any time the game starts to find your spot on the central clock or anytime someone either shorts out or locks in a clock and must return to the central clock to continue. There are 6 black holes on the board. One on the 13 in the central clock and 5 on the bands that lead out to the outer clocks. These short you out as well as if any player lands on you. after the spinner is used players roll 2 dice to advance Players must travel up the next band to the next clock that they do not already have acquired. If a player rolls doubles They go again but after 3 sets of doubles the player shorts out. <br/> To win players must lock in all checkpoints on the outer clocks by landing on the set time indicated on the clocks and then return to the center clock and lock it in as well.<br/> This game comes with colored stones to place as markers when clocks are locked in, custom cast pewter game pawns, wraith tokens, and spinner device set in laser cut 1/8th-inch birch, an Eco canvas 18-inch game board and, a few extra black holes for the black hole generators.<br/><br/>",

        "description": "Savannah is a highly tactical drafting game about scarce resources.<br/><br/>Introduction<br/>The African summer sun is burning down, heat shimmers over the wide land. Food becomes scarce and the fight for survival begins. Herds and prides of numerous Savannah residents get a move on the draining water holes, trying to get an edge on the last food resources with cunning and trickery.<br/><br/>Aim of the Game<br/>Players are trying to maintain the balance between animals and resources in the Savannah. The resource that a player collected the least of is crucial for end game scoring (a player's score is equal to her worst-scoring resource, not her best). The player whose least collected resource exceeds the least collected resources of the other players wins.<br/><br/>Course of the Game<br/>One game consists of a set number of rounds.<br/>One round consist of the following four phases:<br/><br/>(1) Dawn &ndash; choosing Animal cards (drafting)<br/>(2) Noon &ndash; placing Animal tokens (add to play area)<br/>(3) Sunset &ndash; resolving the course of the day (scoring)<br/>(4) Night &ndash; preparing the next round (clear play area)<br/><br/>Game End<br/>The game ends after a certain number of rounds, depending on the player count. 4 rounds in a 2&ndash;3 player game and 3 rounds in a 4&ndash;5 player game.<br/><br/>Each player counts separately each of the food resources and determines the lowest result of these. Compare this result with the result of the other players. Winner of the game is the player with the highest number for this comparison.<br/><br/>",

        "description": "A print and play game of unexplained bovine abduction for two players by Jonathan Leistiko.  One player represents the Alien Leader whilst the other is the Top Cow.<br/><br/>The goal of the Alien Leader is to abduct enough cows of sufficient quality to complete the experiments necessary to ensure success in the upcoming invasion before the space-time fold device runs out of power and transports them back to Dimension Aleph-Zootie. The goal of the Top Cow is to prevent as many cow abductions as possible.<br/><br/>To start 20 cows from the cow deck are laid out face down in front of the Top Cow and a cow marker placed on top of them.  The 20 cow pawns (each matched to one of the cow markers) are placed on 20 of the 160 spaces on the playing board &ndash; which represents a pasture.  The Alien Leader&rsquo;s flying saucer token and 3 x alien pawns are placed, together, on any other vacant space.<br/><br/>At the start of each round, the alien and the cow player each roll two dice.  There are four phases in each round - Cow Cards, Alien Research, Alien Activity, and Cow Movement.  The Alien Leader gets to allocate one of the dice he rolled to one of those four phases, then the Top Cow gets to allocate the dice he rolled to two phases that have no dice. By default, the Alien Leader&rsquo;s last die gets assigned to the last phase without a die.<br/><br/>Cow Cards Phase:<br/>If you&rsquo;re the Top Cow: Draw cards from the Cow Deck equal to the number on the die assigned to the Cow Cards Phase.  Look at the cards you drew.  Put each card face-down under a cow marker in front of you.  No cow may have two cards more than the cow with the least cards on the field.<br/><br/>Alien Research:<br/>If you&rsquo;re the Alien Leader you get research points equal to the number on the Alien Research die.  You may spend a research point to look at the letter on the bottom of any cow in the field or look at one face-down cow card that&rsquo;s attached to a cow.  You may spend any number of points to look at that many cards on the top of the Cow Cards deck and put them back on top of the deck in any order.<br/><br/>Alien Activity Phase<br/>If You&rsquo;re the Alien Leader the number on the Alien Activity die indicates how many aliens you can command this round and how many actions your alien(s) can take.  When an alien acts, it can take the following actions: Move, Recover, Abduct, Fly Saucer, Repair Saucer.  The main aim of this phase is for the Alien Leader to manoeuvre pieces around the board with the intent of abducting cows.<br/><br/>Cow Movement:<br/>If you&rsquo;re the Top Cow you get movement points equal to the number on the Cow Movement die.  You can spend a movement point to move a cow one space. Cows may not move into occupied spaces.<br/><br/>Once the last cow card is drawn, the Cow Cards phase no longer occurs and cannot have dice assigned to it at the start of a round.  The Alien Leader does not get to assign his second die at the start of each round.<br/><br/>If there are no cow cards at the start of a turn and you&rsquo;re the Top Cow, roll a die. If it&rsquo;s odd, the game continues. If it&rsquo;s even, the game ends.<br/><br/>At the end of the game, tally the victory points of the cows in the flying saucer.  The Alien wins if he has 45 or more Victory Points.<br/><br/>",

        "description": "Story &ndash; There&rsquo;s no I in EVL<br/>The world vanquished the very concept of evil along with evil itself long ago. Unfortunately, boredom took its place. If that gives cause for concern, fear not! A small ray of hope exists for the late forces of darkness. The Library of Evil has been rediscovered. As these massive underground ruins are excavated, newfound epic tales of good versus evil regularly send waves of excitement to droves of EVL* fans all across the world. The entire world is drowning in an EVL craze as it yearns for the eradication of boredom. Team EVL believes bringing evil back from the ancient past will do just that. If only they could find a way how. . .<br/><br/><br/>    Social media has deemed the modern spelling of evil to be EVL in an effort to avoid the use of the selfish letter &lsquo;I&rsquo;. Any instance of selfishness, though not inherently evil, is viewed as a lesser good since evil forms of selfishness do not exist.<br/><br/><br/>Gameplay<br/>'Evl' is an UN-cooperative card game where memory, deception, and deduction are key. Join your friends to cure boredom, and release evil back into the world. CAUTION: As you play, evil whispers destroy your once noble thoughts. You will seek the ruin of your friends and to rule the world through the absolute power of evil.<br/><br/>With only one action per turn (Play, Peek, Draw, &hellip;), you must manipulate the state of a ritual circle in an effort to control the most information on the board. All cards are played face down, so carefully observe your opponent&rsquo;s expressions and moves. When you believe the ritual to be in its correct state, declare it complete! If you are right, claim victory as you release evil back into the world! If not, take a seat while the remaining players continue to play.<br/><br/>Evl is designed and illustrated by Ethan Weber. Evl is for 1-5 players and meant for multiple short play sessions at 10-40 minutes each.<br/><br/>",

        "description": "Description from the publisher:<br/><br/>Apochalyptica is an advanced board game for 4-8 players based around a group of people that find themselves facing nuclear war in the late 1940s. WWII has just ended, but any celebration to be had is cut short by news of bombs falling worldwide, with more headed their way. This ragtag group must gather as many supplies as they can before locking themselves away in a bunker for twelve months. During this time, they will have to deal with a number of trials from petty arguments among themselves, to food, water, and oxygen running out; all with the threat of fallout exposure looming around every corner.<br/><br/>The game is board-and-card based, but plays like your average tabletop rpg. Players have the opportunity to roleplay as their characters, dealing with interpersonal relationships within the bunker as you wait for the timer to tick down and free you. Each character has their own unique set of skills and traits to bring to the table, and players must decide how to best use them to ensure the survival of the group.<br/><br/>The first section is the gathering section. Based on the chosen level of gameplay difficulty (easy or normal. Hard doesn't have a gather section and instead starts directly in the bunker with a set amount of supplies) players will travel around the board to &quot;locations&quot; to search for supplies. To search, they roll 1d10 and compare it to a table of outcomes.<br/>At the end of three rounds, they enter a &quot;voting&quot; phase to choose which characters enter the bunker with their supplies, and which must be left outside.<br/><br/>Section two, the &quot;main game&quot;, is twelve rounds in the Bunker where the surviving characters must monitor the levels of food, water, and oxygen. All while trying to keep their sanity levels intact so they don't end up killing each other, or themselves. They have ways of slowing the drop of each of these supply levels, including farming, building a water purification system, monitoring a radio for information about the outside, and interacting with one another in positive ways. Each round, however, players must roll to determine events that occur on their turns that could either help or hinder their progress. It could be something as little as having a bad day and losing a few extra sanity points, to something as disastrous as a radiation leak that permanently seals off a section of the bunker from use.<br/><br/>",

        "description": "This is a playing card game developed for italian band BIZARRO WELT. It is based on their Song &quot;Bizarro-Planet der Affen&quot;. A limited amount of decks printed in professional-grade quality was sold on Christmas 2016.<br/><br/>The objective of the game is to draw cards from a pile and avoid cards labeled with an evil, mutant ape by neutralizing them with a &quot;battle&quot; card. If an ape card cannot be neutralized, the player looses. The number of battle cards in the game decreases over time. The last player still standing wins.<br/><br/>Additional action cards can give an individual player and advantage over others, for example:<br/><br/>- The &quot;future zombie&quot; card allows a player to look at and reshuffle the top three cards of the drawing pile.<br/><br/>- The &quot;fight&quot; card allows a player to challenge an other player to a side competition (e.g. arm wrestling, throwing darts, drinking etc.). The winner may then take one of the loosers' cards.<br/><br/>- The &quot;downfall&quot; card moves all &quot;ape&quot; cards in the game to the top of the drawing pile.<br/><br/>The game can be played by two to five players, but is most fun with four or five players.<br/><br/>",

Governments long ago failed after being dismantled by Emperor Trump. In A.I., corporations are trying to continue to line their pockets with the use of technology, except the technology is starting to work against that. Players are trying to profit handily while staying one step ahead of the A.I., which is starting to think of humans as a virus in the physical world.<br/><br/>A.I.&rsquo;s key mechanism is the idea of an engine-building game with a potentially intelligent engine. In most engine-building games, players assemble an engine through the acquisition and management of resources to construct from a selection of parts. At some point in the game, the engine that will be run for the sole purpose of making victory points. The interesting decisions in these games is when to make that shift.<br/> In A.I., the engines have a chance to become sentient and could actually become part of a dummy player in the game that both hinders the ability of the player to progress and competes against all players to possibly win the game.<br/><br/>",

        "description": "A card game for 2-4 players based on survival and accomplishment in the Florida City of St. Augustine.<br/><br/>St. Augustine was founded in 1565 by Pedro Menendez. It is the oldest, continuously inhabited European settlement in North America. For the first 200 years of its existence, it was controlled by Spain. The town itself was always very small and poor, but it held an important strategic position. It helped defend the treasure fleets on their way back to Spain by preventing the English and French from building their own settlements along the Gulf stream.<br/><br/>In this game players actively recruit townsfolk, earn gold, gain military glory, and build structures while being mercilessly subjected to hurricanes, raids, disease, and hostile indians.<br/><br/>Each turn is equal to about a decade. The game ends after 20 turns, at which point, historically, the British take control of the city.<br/><br/>Each Player gets a player mat which is divided up into 7 boxes: Government, Churches, Forts, Population, Gold, Glory and Victory Points. Tokens are placed in the boxes on player mats to keep track of each players score in that category. Each player starts with 7 population, 5 gold, and 3 glory.<br/><br/>There are 2 Common Decks: <br/>1.  The Event Deck - one random event occurs each turn. <br/>2.  The Action Deck which comprises four suits:<br/>-   Economic (Types: Industry, Agriculture, Trade)<br/>-   Military (Types: Fight the French, Fight the English, Control) <br/>-   Population (Types: Indians, Blacks, Europeans)<br/>-   Buildings (Types: Government, Churches, Forts)<br/>Each suit has 3 types of card with 4 cards for each type. In addition the deck has 4 leader (wild) cards.<br/><br/>Each turn is divided into 7 Phases:<br/><br/>1.  Draw Phase<br/>-   Each Player fills their hand to 10 action cards.<br/><br/>2.  Trade Phase<br/>-   Players may trade action cards with each other and may also trade tokens on their player mats.<br/><br/>3.  Meld Phase<br/>-   Players may make melds. A meld consists of 1-4 cards of the same type. One card in a meld may be a leader. One card in a meld earns 1 token. Two cards in a meld earns 3 tokens. Three cards in a meld earns 6 tokens. Four cards in a meld earns 10 tokens. <br/>-   You can make a max of 4 melds, one from each suit. <br/>-   Tokens earned go into the relevant box on the player&rsquo;s mat. (e.g. tokens from a population meld go into the population box, tokens from a military meld go into the glory box).<br/><br/>4.  Building Phase<br/>-   Buildings provide bonus resources. Tokens are awarded for having the highest and second highest church, government and fort scores.<br/><br/>5.  Event Phase<br/> -  Flip over the top card of the event deck. The event is resolved immediately and affects all players.<br/><br/>6.  Score Phase<br/>-   Players gain Victory Points (VP) in based on their population, gold and glory scores.<br/><br/>7.  End Phase<br/>-   Players may discard their action hands down to zero cards.<br/>-   Each player loses one half his gold rounding down. <br/>-   Each player loses all his Glory.<br/><br/>The game ends after 20 turns.  The player with the most VP at the end of the game wins.<br/><br/>",

Each turn the underlord push their luck by sending monsters out to raid villages, towns or cities to gather plunder which is used to recruit minions and build the dungeon.<br/><br/>Each turn one hero arrives at the dungeon seeking treasure. Depending on how hard the Underlord raided, this could be a plucky peasant or a gristle nemesis of evil. The hero travels through the dungeon in a tower defence fashion being battled on the way by the dungeons defenders.<br/><br/>The game is won by the player who accrues the most magic items from fallen hero's by the end of the game.<br/><br/>",

The game has cards for different Wagashi, and cards for subjects. Players are trying to give new Wagashi interesting names.<br/><br/>The Dealer draws a random Wagashi card from the Wagashi deck. That is the Wagashi to be named. The Dealer then chooses some subjects from the subject cards. For example, the subjects are like 宇宙 (outer space), 風景 (scenery), 自然 (nature). Each of the other players must choose a subject, and think of a name that fits the Wagashi and subject. The Dealer chooses the best name.

The game faithfully reenacts the harsh combat reality of this period - heavy cavalry charges breaking enemy lines, lethal salvoes of archers or brutal infantry melees. Players have to choose the right tactics making flank or rear attacks as well as organize their regiments in proper formations. It is also important to take advantage of the lay of the land and use special abilities of commanders and units.<br/><br/>The game can be played in three different game modes for 2 to 4 players: standalone Scenarios designed by the author, standalone Scenarios custom-build by the players and the Campaign. In the Blood and Dust Campaign, the players become captains of mercenary forces who sell their military services in a world full of dangers, intrigues and brutal battles. Your heroes start from commanding a small detachment of units, but as the Campaign progresses, they will muster additional units for their armies. They will improve skills and search for fresh recruits, while their soldiers will gain experience in uncountable skirmishes. For a sack full of gold they will accept commissions, helping the wealthy and the powerful attain even more influence. Alternatively, they will seek glory and money on their own.<br/><br/>",

There are 2 types of units, Population Tokens(PT) and City Tokens(CT). Each player starts by placing 7 PT onto one empty area on the board.<br/><br/>A pad and pencil is used to keep track of Idea Points, Resource Points, Victory Points, and Advances.<br/><br/>There are 8 Phases:<br/><br/>1.  Leader Phase<br/>-   Roll once on the Great Leader Table. Dependant on result a player will receive population tokens or points (Idea, Resource, Move or Victory)<br/>-   The old Leader dies and a new leader is rolled for each of your turns.<br/><br/>2.  City Phase<br/>-   Roll once on the City Table for each City you control. Dependant on results a player will receive a population token or a point (Idea, Resource, Move or Victory)<br/><br/>3.  Advance Phase<br/>-   Gain 1D6 Idea Points (IP). Idea points are saved from turn to turn. <br/>-   A player may turn in 5 IP to gain 1 random advance.  This is determined by rolling once on a Research Table. <br/>-   The second advance you buy in a turn costs 7 IP, the third 9 IP and so on. <br/>-   Maximum IP you can store is 15. Excess is lost.<br/><br/>4.  Growth Phase<br/>-   Gain 1D6 Population Tokens (PT). These may be placed in any areas a player controls. <br/>-   Max PT a single area can maintain is 10 (plus 1 city). Excess is lost.<br/><br/>5.  Build Phase<br/>-   Gain 1D6 Resource Points (RP). A player may spend 5 RP and discard 5 PT to build a City in any area he controls. An area may contain only 1 city. <br/>-   A player may spend 10 RP to gain 1 Wonder of his choice. You cannot build more Wonders than you currently have Cities. <br/>-   Max RP you can store is 15. Excess is lost.<br/><br/>6.  Disaster Phase<br/>-   A player rolls 1D6. On a roll of 5+ his culture experiences a disaster. <br/>-   Next a player rolls 1D6 to determine how many Population Tokens he loses. These are taken from any of his areas.  A city may be broken down into 5 PT to take losses. <br/>-   If you have an Advance that mitigates a disaster you get -2 to the casualty roll.<br/><br/>7.  Clash Phase<br/>-   For each other Civ a player is adjacent to, he may choose either trade or war. <br/>-   If he chooses trade roll on a Trade Table to determine results<br/>-   If he chooses War, attacker picks 2 adjacent areas, 1 controlled by each player.  Each player rolls 2D6 and adds bonuses from War advances. <br/>The higher War roll total wins (Defender wins ties). Loser loses all units in the area lost. The winner gains control of the opposing Area by placing 1 PT from off the board onto the newly conquered area.<br/><br/>8.  Migration Phase<br/>-   Roll 1D6 to get that many Move Points (MP). <br/>-   A player may use 1 MP to move 1 PT to an adjacent area. Sailing and road advances allow PT to move further. <br/>-   Move points are not saved from turn to turn.<br/><br/>The Game ends when any of the following happens: All areas containing land are occupied; all wonders are built; any one player has 7 or more cities or only 1 player is left (automatic winner).<br/><br/>At end of game add up Victory Points from advances and Iconic Leaders, city rolls + 1 per area you occupy + 5 per Wonder built.  The player with the highest VP score wins.<br/><br/>",

        "description": "Description &amp; Theme<br/>Wrestlers! Management has asked you to stick around and put together a dark match to keep the fans in their seats. There isn't enough time to choreograph the whole match, so it is up to you to put on and improvise the best match possible. The only requirement is there are specific spots management wants you to hit because the fans want to see what the fans want to see! Can you put on the most electrifying match and keep the fans cheering or will the only sound you hear after the 1-2-3 be the sound of crickets?<br/><br/>Goal of the Game<br/>Unlike other head-to-head wrestling themed games or fighting games, the goal is not to beat your opponent by depleting their hit points. The goal is to put on the best match possible and getting the most fans (victory points)!<br/><br/>Gameplay<br/>1. Separate the cards into a Momentum Deck (cards 1 &ndash; 7) and a Spot Deck (cards 8 &ndash; 13).<br/>2. Place 3 pairs of Spot cards in the center of the table face up. The sum of each of the pairs is the goal you are trying to reach for each Spot.<br/>3. Place the Momentum Deck to another side.<br/>4. Each player draws 5 cards from the Momentum Deck.<br/>5. Choose a player to go first.<br/><br/>Players now take turns playing a card from their hand on one Spot, trying to reach that goal on their turn. Reaching that goal perfectly wins the Spot and equates to more fans, but passing (when a valid card can't be played) forfeits the Spot to the opponent and giving them more fans. Cards played from the hand represent simple wrestling moves, like strikes and holds, that escalate to the Spot, which are power moves like DDTs and spears!<br/><br/>When there are no Momentum cards or Spots remaining, players enter the Pin Fall attempt! Play turns into a War-style game, flipping over remaining cards in the hand to see who wins the pin. After the pin, all Perfect and Botched (passed) Spots are scored up.<br/><br/>Reading your opponent, evaluating the cards in play, the cards in your hand, and measuring the potential outcomes on future Spots will determine the bright fan favorite in ASWG: Dark Match!<br/><br/>",

        "description": "A dice game based on the Computer Animated TV series Reboot. Can be played solo or multiplayer.<br/><br/>In a round, each player gets one turn. Each player&rsquo;s turn represents a single episode. During his turn a player will roll dice against a number of tables and gain (or lose) assets. Each Asset has a power level and/or modifies the power levels of <br/>other assets. Pencil and paper are used to keep track of roll results, power calculations, and Victory Points (VP).<br/><br/>Each turn has 6 Phases:<br/><br/>1.   Location Phase<br/>-    Roll 1D20 on the Location Table to determine the key location for the current episode. Take actions as described on the card &ndash; this may involving rolling on another table.<br/><br/>2.   Threat Phase<br/>-     Roll 1D6 on the Primary Threat Table to determine what is the major threat for the current episode.  Dependant on threat type (Game Cube, Virus or Web) roll on respective threat tables and resolve (which may involve rolling against other tables)<br/><br/>3.   Hero Phase<br/>-     Roll 4 times on the Guardian Hero Table. You may then reroll any or all of these rolls once.<br/><br/>4.    Ally Phase<br/>-      Roll once on the Ally Table. You may then reroll this roll once.<br/><br/>5.    Key Phase<br/> -     Roll once on the Key Tool Table. You may then reroll this roll once.<br/><br/>6.   Score Phase<br/>-     Guardian Power = Combined Power of all Heroes, Allies, and Key Assets. <br/>-     Threat Power = Combined power of all Game, Viral, and Web Assets. <br/>-     If the Threat Power is greater than the Guardian Power, the Guardians fail and you score no points. If the Guardian Power is greater, score Victory Points equal to the Threat Power.<br/><br/>The winner is the player with the most Victory Points (VP) at the end of 6 rounds. <br/>If playing solo, players should attempt to beat their previous score.<br/><br/>",

Players traverse grid nodes and place component cards onto grid lines. Once you close a circuit you begin to draw power from the enclosed area.<br/><br/>Acquired power can be used to purchase character upgrades, which increase player abilities. Or technology can be purchased, to help your play or hamper your opponents. Finally, megaliths can be purchased/built, to increase the power gained from areas.<br/><br/>Combat can be enacted to battle your opponent for control of grid nodes or grid lines. Inserted into the combat/poker deck are random event cards, which bring elements of chance to the game.<br/><br/>",

Each player begins with the same base amount of Mystic Shards each turn, to cast spells. The only advantage you have is your skill in drafting, casting and using your abilities at key times during the game.<br/><br/>There are 3 types of cards you&rsquo;ll use to defeat your opponents, Creatures, Relics and Spells.<br/><br/>When you cast your angel, demon, dragon or wizard you must choose between the defense zone or the attack zone. You can move them later if you need more defense or attackers to finish off someone.<br/><br/>When your creatures die, collect Soul Shards and use them to acquire more powerful spells!<br/><br/>The best part, in a 3 or 4 player game, is you&rsquo;re defending yourself against the player on the right while attacking the player on the left. This makes the strategy change throughout the game as you react to the other players.

        "description": "A board &amp; card game of abstract skirmish level space combat for 2 players.<br/><br/>The game is based on the Iron Sky movie. In 1945 Nazis, using flying-saucers, escaped to and colonized the dark side of the moon. They call themselves the Fourth Reich. Ever since, and unknown to us, they&rsquo;ve been plotting their return. Their fleet is currently in low earth Orbit, bombarding New York with large moon rocks and sending down waves of Attack saucers. Unknown to the Nazis and to each other, each of the major Earth nations has secretly weaponized their communication and science satellites. These have now banded together to fight off the Nazi Invasion Fleet.<br/><br/>Play is conducted on an 8x8 grid using chits, figures or miniatures to represent units.  Units start on the back two rows of the player&rsquo;s side of the board. Units are of various classes (Dreadnought, Carrier, Flying Saucer Squadron, Large, Medium and Small ships). Each unit has a designated hit value, and may have specific capabilities. Players can elect to play from 3 different scenarios though gameplay is common to all three.<br/><br/>Players share a common deck of movement, attack, defence and special cards.<br/><br/>Players take turns with each turn comprising 3 phases:<br/><br/><br/>     Tactical Phase<br/>         Draw 3 cards.  Max hand size = 5 cards.  Discard excess cards.<br/>    <br/>     Move Phase<br/>         Play (discard) a move card to move one of your units. The move card has a number indicating the number of spaces the unit moves. Moves can be diagonal or orthogonal. Units may move through (past) other units.<br/>    <br/>     Fire Phase<br/>         Play (discard) an Attack card to have a unit attack. The attack card has a number indicating the range of the attack. Attacks can be diagonal or orthogonal. Units may attack through (past) other units.<br/>         Every attack does a base of 1 damage (target loses 1 hit). A unit reduced to 0 hits is destroyed. <br/>         Your opponent may play defence cards to negate your attack.<br/>    <br/><br/><br/>Victory is achieved through complete destruction of the opposing fleet.<br/><br/>",

        "description": "Kipoud is a card drafting game in which you try to build the biggest, most valuable house.<br/><br/>In Kipoud, you will have 2 stack of cards, one with &quot;construction&quot; cards and the other with &quot;tree&quot; cards. There are two ways to start the game, in fast version each player will have a &quot;foundation&quot; card, and in normal version players start empty handed.<br/><br/>In turn, the active player will first roll a six-sided die. On a 6, he loses his turn. On a 1, a 3, a 4 or a 5, he has the choice between drawing 1 &quot;construction&quot; card or 2 &quot;tree&quot; cards. On a 2, he performs the action &quot;draw&quot; twice. Then, if he can, if he wants, he can play cards from his hand. The goal is to build the houses of the &quot;Moigeux&quot;, small creatures who think only of their material goods and who never cease to build ever bigger or always more ... To build, we will have to make combinations. For example, to build a roof, you will need the &quot;roof&quot; card and a &quot;green wood&quot; card + &quot;brown wood&quot; card. You discard the raw material and place your roof in front of you.<br/><br/>There are action cards that let you interact with other players or defend yourself against action cards from other players. <br/>Once your turn is over, you must not have more than 10 cards in hand.<br/><br/>How do I win?<br/><br/>When the &quot;Construction&quot; stack is empty, the game ends. The points in the top right corner on the &quot;Construction&quot; cards are counted and the one with the most points is declared &quot;Grand Vainqueur&quot; or Winner.<br/><br/>",

The first player to visit all of their destinations and return home is the winner.  The game has a deck of Interstate cards which allows for interactive card play as players can help their own cause or hinder other players' travel.<br/><br/>Interstate is presented as an easy-to-learn basic game but also has several optional variants that can be used to spice up the basic game.  Because of the randomness and unpredictability inherent in the play of the game, as well as the variants, Interstate has excellent replay value.<br/><br/>Most games of Interstate are close; it is rare to have a runaway winner. The play of the cards helps to rein in anyone who gets too much of a lead over the other players.  There will always be unpleasant events that will hinder your game but basically the person who can most efficiently plan out the course of visiting their destinations will have the best chance of winning.<br/><br/>",

Each players is dealt a certain number of cards, depending on the amount of players.<br/><br/>On his turn a player plays a card, either a square or a helper card. In case of a square card he puts the corresponding piece on the board as long as it fits somewhere. In case of a helper card he carries out the special function.

The result was an an easy-to-learn but surprisingly strategic card game that is a cross between Uno, War, and with some Texas Holdem sprinkled in.<br/><br/>Players take turns drawing and playing cards to win battles (and cards).  Some special action cards allow players to steal cards, change their character, void other player's cards and more.<br/><br/>During battle everyone plays one more &quot;reinforcement&quot; card just for themselves except for Holograms who play two. Monsters count claws, Robots count lasers, and holograms count monster, claws, or lasers (whichever has fewer in the middle).<br/><br/>Add up your totals and the highest number wins. The battle winner takes all the cards in the middle and their reinforcement card and sets them aside. This is their point pile and counts toward winning the game. The battle losers keep their reinforcement card.<br/><br/>Keep playing until someone runs out of cards and whomever has the most cards wins the game<br/><br/>",

The game has a deck of 40 cards ranked Ace to 10, in four suites; Fuel, Bio-chemistry, Securities, Grain. Every card also has a Bonus or Penalty. Some cards have a special ability, activated when in a player's hand or when showing as a table card. Otherwise, text on cards is for flavour.<br/><br/>This game also has a secondary pot, the Bank. The winner of a round gains a bonus from the bank, the losers (players who didn't fold, still active in the round) pay penalties to the Bank. The bonus and penalties depend on table cards. Therefore, in this game, players are allowed to fold whilst others check, since a player may want to get out of the round when they see the penalties.<br/><br/>The Bank also serves as the game timer. There are three Banks made at the start of the game. Each time a Bank is depleted, the next Bank starts but the minimum bet is raised. When the third Bank is exhausted, the game is over.<br/><br/>The text on the cards is fairly simple (for example: 'you don't have to pay the penalty as the loser' or 'the bonus values for Grains is doubled this round&quot;.

        "description": "A board game for 2-4+ players with a Charlie Brown, Snoopy, Peanuts theme.<br/><br/>There are 2 decks: <br/>-   The Gag Deck - These cards form the board. They are claimed by players and are worth gag points. In order to be claimed the player must move his pawn onto that card and discard 2 Kid cards of the indicated type. <br/>-   The Kid Deck - There are 2 basic types of Kid Cards: main characters and Peanut gallery.  There are 4 sets of main characters: Charlie Brown, Snoopy, Linus and Lucy, with 10 identical cards in each set.  There are 12 Peanut Gallery cards each listing one supporting character.<br/><br/>The board is a 6 X 6 grid with each space containing 1 face-up gag card. As gag cards are claimed during play they are replenished from the Gag Deck. The game ends when a gag card needs to be replaced on the board, and there are none left in the Gag Deck.<br/><br/>Players start with their pawns in separate corner spaces of the board and with 2 Kid cards in hand.  Players take turns, with each turn comprising 5 phases:<br/><br/>1.  Draw Phase<br/>-   Draw 2 Kid Cards from the top of the Kid Deck and put them in your hand. If your pawn is adjacent to any opponent&rsquo;s pawns, you may trade Kid cards from your hands. Trades must be agreeable to both parties.<br/><br/>2.  Roll Phase<br/>-   Roll one die.<br/><br/>3.  Move Phase<br/>-   You may move your pawn a number of spaces equal to the number you rolled in roll phase OR less. Moves may be orthogonal or diagonal. You may not land in the same space occupied by another pawn though you may move through (past, over) other player&rsquo;s pawns.<br/><br/>4.  Claim Phase<br/>-   You may claim the Gag card in the space your pawn currently occupies. Each Gag card lists 2 Kid cards that must be discarded in order to claim it. Place the claimed card into your Gag pile.  Replace the gag card you just claimed with the top card of the Gag deck. If there are no Gag cards left, the game ends.<br/><br/>5.   End Phase<br/>-    Max hand size is 7 cards. Discard excess cards.<br/><br/>The secondary character cards in the Kid Deck have a variety of extra uses: <br/>&bull;    Discard 1 card to increase the result of a roll by 1 or 2. <br/>&bull;    Discard 2 cards to draw 3 Kid Cards and discard any 2 from your hand. <br/>&bull;    Discard 2 cards to cause a target Gag card on the board to be discarded and then replaced. <br/>&bull;    Discard 1 card to get a second move roll.  <br/>&bull;    Discard 1 card after you have made a Claim to get an extra Roll, Move, and Claim phase.<br/><br/>The player with the most gag points at the end of the game wins.<br/><br/>",

In Competitive play, one player takes the role of Outer Space, and all other players command the four Astronauts.<br/><br/>Rounds looks like this: (1) Outer Space plays a Card Game: drawing a hand of hazards and laying them in ambush on the table. (2) The Astronauts play a Worker Placement Game: positioning workers around the ship to use its defenses. (3) Players compare Space&rsquo;s cards with the Astronauts&rsquo; workers, dealing damage wherever defenses fell short.<br/><br/>Outer Space wins if it manages to kill enough Astronaut workers in order to achieve victory. Astronauts win if they manage to keep enough of their workers alive until Outer Space runs out of hazard cards.<br/><br/>",

The player with the highest strength in a battle zone controls it.<br/><br/>When all twelve boxes are filled, the player who controls two out of three battle zones is the winner.<br/><br/>Setup<br/><br/>Players start with a blank Land, Air, &amp; Sea score sheet, a pen, and a twelve-sided die. (If you don't have a twelve-sided die, any die will do.)<br/><br/>Play<br/><br/>In turn, each player rolls a die and writes the number rolled in any open box on either player's side. (Hint: Put high numbers in your boxes and low numbers in your opponent's boxes.)<br/><br/>When both boxes in a player's battle zone have numbers in them, multiply the numbers together and write the result on the &quot;Strength&quot; blank.<br/><br/>When both players have a result for Strength in a battle zone, circle the higher number. (Cross out both numbers if there's a tie.)<br/><br/>Winning<br/><br/>When all twelve boxes are filled in and all six Strength numbers written down, the player who has higher Strength numbers in at least two battle zones wins the game.<br/><br/>If each player controls one battle zone and the third is a tie, then the game is a tie.<br/><br/>",

The goal of Clachan is to create a line of stones from one side of the board to the other while your opponent works against you by blocking your progress or capturing your stones. The game is over when a player either creates a line which results in a win, or the board is filled with no lines created resulting in a draw. During the game players may place new stone, move existing stones, and capture opponent stones.<br/><br/>",

Be careful though, only the player that lands the killing blow gets the glory! Players must strategize when to attack, when to defend, and where to stand. Players also have to contend with other players using their abilities to turn the game on its head, charging ahead of the pack, making a monster retaliate against someone else, or coercing other players into helping.<br/><br/>This is a deck building game that incorporates strategical movement on a tabletop board. We have removed as many dice as possible to prevent the game from being too luck based, allowing your own strategies by what cards you acquire to thrive. The game also has multiple strategic levels. What cards to acquire, where to move on the board, and when to attack. All of these can alter what other players might be planning!<br/><br/>",

One player takes on the role of the fish, who is trying to navigate the ever-shifting reef and escape the shark.  Meanwhile, the other player endeavors to find the shark its next meal.<br/><br/>The game plays out on a 5x5 grid made of double-sided cards, with one additional card.  On a player's turn, first the reef must be shifted.  The player chooses any row or column that wasn't just shifted by the other player and doesn't contain any player tokens.  All the cards in the selected row or column are moved by one space in the grid, thus changing the map layout.  After shifting the reef, the player moves according to the rules for their role.<br/><br/>The fish player wins if they can move across the reef and move off the shark player's map edge, while the shark player claims victory if they can land on or move over the fish player's token.<br/><br/>",

There&rsquo;s just one thing, the only way to earn your seniority is by trading for it; with office supplies. You&rsquo;ll need to recruit a team and search through desks on your break to find the supplies you need. Trade the supplies in the break room to the department requesting them and try not to break any drawers in the process. You have one work week to get your seniority and you&rsquo;ll need to get it by any means necessary or lose your job!<br/><br/>Cubicle Raiders consists of 5 Days (rounds) and each Day there will be a number of Breaks(turns) determined by the Department card for that day. During their turn, each player will be able to pick 2 of 3 actions: Search, Trade or Recruit. To Search, a player will move their meeple to a drawer on one of the desk cards that has a supply they need. They will then roll the Search Die to determine if they successfully found the supply, did not find it or broke the drawer. If they found the supply they add the amount to their supply tracker, if they broke the drawer that drawer is no longer searchable. If more than 50% of a desk&rsquo;s drawers are broken that desk is no longer searchable, if 2 desks are no longer searchable the day is over.<br/><br/>To Trade, a player moves their meeple to the breakroom and trades only the supplies the current department is looking for. Each supply is worth so many seniority points determined by the trade ratio on the players supply card. Each player can trade up to 5 Seniority Points worth of each supply during their trade action. To Recruit, a player must move their meeple to the breakroom, they can then recruit another employee by paying the recruit&rsquo;s seniority point cost, this is identified on the recruit&rsquo;s card. These recruits add special abilities to help the player in the game.<br/><br/>After the last day is over the player with most Seniority Points wins!<br/><br/>&mdash;description from the publisher<br/><br/>",

You, your cards, and your opponents will determine what is in the canon - but it is up to you to be the player whose own canon matches the central one most closely and most often, to earn the most points.<br/><br/>Each player begins with a hand of five cards.  Throughout the game, players will collectively play cards into and take cards from a set of seven central canon cards.  Players also play into and take cards from their own personal set of seven canon cards. On a turn, players can draw a card or play a card.  Cards can be drawn from the central canon, personal canon, draw stack, or discard pile.  Cards can be played into the central canon, personal canon, or discard pile.  Matching cards can be placed on top of each other in subsequent turns, which can make it more difficult to remove a card from the central canon or make that stack of cards in your personal canon worth many more points.  The game ends the turn after the draw pile is depleted.  Final scoring is determined by the number of cards in each player's personal canon that match the central canon.<br/><br/>The New Testament Edition includes passages from the New Testament of the Christian Bible.<br/><br/>",

        "description": "User summary:<br/><br/>Growby is a tile laying game. The tiles are square. Each corner of every tile is colored (so that the interior of the tile is a blank diamond that has a number inscribed). Players lay tiles from their hand in a square grid trying to match up the colors on their tiles corners with the colors on the orthogonally adjacent tiles.  The more colors that match, the more points that are received for that tile placement.<br/><br/>If a player can not place a tile, she must draw tiles until she is able to place a tile. Each tile drawn this way results in negative five points.<br/><br/>Games are played to 1000 points.<br/><br/>The tiles are wooden. This game was hand made in a limited run in 1988. At least 155 games were produced. A patent was applied for to protect the game but was not granted.<br/><br/>",

Players try to score victory points by constructing buildings and/or winning battles on the island.<br/><br/>At the beginning of the game, each player has a different set of four action cards, which varies by player order. Each round, they take turns playing action card until all players have taken three actions. At the end of round, they pass their set of cards to the player to the left.<br/><br/>By performing an action, players may construct/upgrade a building, gain resources, raise military power, initiate a battle, etc. There are plenty of player interactions, such as limited nubmer of buildings in a territory and initiating a battle with a specific player. But battle is not always necessary to win the game.<br/><br/>A player can win immediately by upgrading a building into the castle, but it requires much military power. Strategy selection (winning by castle, battles, buildings, or their hybrid) and action planning with consideration of rotating sets of cards are keys to winning the game.<br/><br/>開拓しつつ、資源を獲得し、建物を建てて、勝利点を得ていくタイプのゲームです。<br/>基本的にはリソースマネジメントです。<br/>資源獲得をして建物を建てて、建物の効果で方向性が定まります。<br/><br/>インタラクションは、豊富にあります。<br/>建築や目的地カードの早い者勝ちという要素や、特定のプレイヤーに戦争/内戦を仕掛けるという直接攻撃もあります。ただし、直接攻撃を強制される類のゲームではありません。<br/><br/>城によるの勝利条件と、戦争/内戦による牽制と、カードセットの巡りによる計画性がこのゲームのポイントです。<br/><br/>",

The title &quot;Friegur&quot; stands for: &quot;Feldgraue rangen in Ehren, gewannen unsterblichen Ruhm&quot;<br/><br/>Exerpt of the description by Elfriede Strey, as suplied at June 9, 1934 to the US patent Office: My invention relates to a game to be played on a board like chess by two persons or two parties and in which the aim is for one party to beat the other, under observation of determined rules.<br/><br/>Whereas in chess the various chessmen are moved merely according to their nature, the board of my new game has aspecial division or characterization of the squares which prescribes that determined menmust move only on determined squares.<br/><br/>According to the leading idea of my new game the board represents a terrain which comprises a fortress for each party, a glacis surrounding each fortress, and a battle ground situatedbetween the positions of the two parties. Both in the battle ground and in the glacises there are obstacles of various kinds which are denoted by differently marked squares. These obstacles further determine the moves of the various men, beyond their motion prescribed by their own nature. The rules of my new game, which may represent for example a battle for fortress and flag, further prescribe that the men or fighters may be both promoted and degraded, so that, for example, the <br/> private soldier may be promoted to oflicer, if certain conditions are fulfilled, whilst an officer who has been derelict, may be degraded. Finally, as in chess, my new game provides that the fighters of one party may be taken according to determined rules, in order to break the fighting power of the enemy gradually.<br/><br/>",

A gang of motley monkeys has stripped all your shipwrecks of vital parts. The goal of the game is simple: collect the plunder and monkeys that you&rsquo;ll need to repair your ship and sail home. In order to get those items, you&rsquo;ll need you&rsquo;ll need to outbid and outsmart the other castaways in auctions run by Captain Coconuts, the wily monkey leader who controls the island &mdash; and your fate.<br/><br/>Shipwrecked is a classic auction game with a twist: Instead of bidding with your bananas, you&rsquo;ll have a hand of six tokens that you&rsquo;ll use to make your bid in a series of secret auctions. Each token interacts with those placed by the other players - but no one knows who has played what until the bids are revealed. Once a round of the auction round is won, the other players can spend their bananas (cash) in order to push the auction to the next level. If they do, more plunder and monkey cards are added, and the auction continues!<br/><br/>During every round, the cost of winning increases by one banana, as does the cost of pushing the auction forward. Your bid tokens all have unique effects, but once they&rsquo;ve been played in an auction they stay on the board. That means you&rsquo;ll want to save your most powerful bid tokens for the moment when they count the most.<br/><br/>It&rsquo;s easy to learn, but the more you play, the more you&rsquo;ll discover the layers of depth and strategy in the bid and push gameplay. The order that you use your tokens not only determines the outcome of the current auction round but your ability to effectively bid in upcoming rounds as well. Winning auctions will give you the plunder and monkeys you need to win, but you&rsquo;ll be tempted to trade in your hard-won booty for short term gain: plunder cards can be traded in for extra bananas, while the monkey cards have special powers that can shift the outcome of the auctions &mdash; and the game!<br/><br/>",

Each expedition must have one or more (to a maximum of 4) ships.   Expeditions can also have trade goods or silver to trade for cargo. They can also have gifts to give to foreign rulers, and great Captains to improve their chance of success. Expeditions are created using cards drawn from an &ldquo;expedition&rdquo; deck of 60 cards.<br/><br/>Each player has an expedition mat divided into 4 sections numbered 1 to 4. These correspond to each of the 4 possible expeditions the player may have going at the same time.  The expedition and treasure cards of a particular expedition are placed in its own section.<br/><br/>Play is conducted on an expedition track that is 40 spaces long. There is a start space (England) and an end space (Pacific Ocean).  The spaces in between represent locations or event that may a have a positive, negative or no effect on the expedition. When starting out, an expedition moves towards the end space.  When reaching the End space or any point before then, the expedition may turn back. When an expedition finally returns, its treasures go into the expedition&rsquo;s profit pile, and all its expedition cards are discarded.<br/><br/>Players take turns with each turn comprising 3 phases:<br/><br/>Expedition Phase<br/><br/>     Draw 2 cards from the expedition deck and discard 1 of them.  Add the card to your expedition pile. <br/><br/><br/>Launch Phase<br/><br/>     If your expedition pile contains at least 1 ship, you may launch an expedition. <br/>     If your expedition pile has 8 cards you must launch, unless you don&rsquo;t have a ship, in which case you must discard your entire expedition pile, and gain 1 treasure. <br/>     Place an expedition counter onto the start space of the expedition track and place all the expedition cards from the pile into the corresponding section of your expedition mat. <br/><br/><br/>Action Phase<br/><br/>     In order of expedition number, move your expeditions along the track by rolling 1D6 and moving the expedition that number of spaces. Each space offers one possibility, helpful, or hurtful: trade, resupply, hardship, storm, capture ship, gift, cotton or naught. Spaces are resolved accordingly.<br/><br/><br/>The game ends after 2 hours, or when the treasure deck runs out. The player with the most Treasure Points (TP) in their profit pile at that time wins.<br/><br/>",

There are loads of dirty party games out there, but not many that also have a &quot;getting to know you&quot; element. And that's where we come in.<br/><br/>QWDG is pretty simple. It's a deck of personal questions that range from thought-provoking to ridiculous, awkward to obscene. When a card is drawn, everyone writes their own answer to the question. Then one person tries to correctly identify who wrote each answer.<br/><br/>To sum up: QWDG is a dirty party game for people who want to show off their disgusting sense of humor and prove how well they know their friends.<br/><br/>",

During the game, players will take on a NEW and &quot;Special&quot; Mission called &quot;Smuggler's Run&quot; and in doing so may exchange cards for various tracks to UNLOCK a given dice.  With a maximum of five (5) dice which can be UNLOCKED, plus a BONUS 1D20 when you unlock two (2) or more dice results in the possibility of Scoring 60 Credits.  But as this is a Trade Mission ... You must be wary that your Tradeship does NOT get destroyed as you collect more valuable illegal Cargo during this mission while avoiding &quot;losing it all&quot; in the event that your Tradeship gets destroyed.<br/><br/>Remember this Expansion is build upon the framework of the &quot;Planetary Expansion&quot; and not only the &quot;core&quot; game.  However at this present time we feel that it may be incompatible with the Tactical Core (Future Expansion currently not available). Both expansions add a certain depth to the game which alter the way the game is played.  Because of the contrasting winning conditions, these two expansions cannot be played simultaneously.<br/><br/>Additionally this Expansion offers update Player Game Pads (Horizontal) which are more compatible with the NEW &quot;Smuggler's Cache&quot; Game Pads which are exclusive and personalized for each Faction in the game.  This also adds a bit of variability in Game Play allowing players to TRY the various Factions and their Resources for a different experience (in terms of resources).<br/><br/>",

Players move from one stage to the next at different speeds and do not directly interact until the last stage, the Space stage. At the beginning of each stage, each player chooses 1 characteristic for his race &ndash; these characteristics improve a particular attribute for the race.<br/><br/>Players share a common set of Victory Point Tokens (VT), Food (Resource) Tokens (FT), Hunger Tokens (HT) and Death Tokens (DT). Each player starts with 1 VT and 3 FT.<br/><br/>Players take turns with each turn comprising 5 Phases:<br/><br/>Mutation Phase<br/><br/>     Draw 1 (or, possibly, more) card from the deck (of the stage you are in). <br/><br/><br/>Event Phase<br/><br/>     Roll once on the event table (of the stage you are in) and resolve the event. <br/><br/><br/>Selection Phase<br/><br/>     Most events are challenges between your species and another species that is either weaker, equal, or stronger than you. <br/>     To resolve a challenge first roll on the challenge type table to determine what attribute will affect the challenge.  Next Roll 1D6 (Attribution Roll) and add your level in the indicated Attribute. This is your Attribution Total. <br/>     Next roll 1D6, 2D6, or 3D6 depending on the Strength of the Challenger. <br/><br/><br/>This is the Challenge Roll. <br/><br/>     If the Attribution Total is greater than the Challenge Roll, you win the Challenge. <br/><br/><br/>If it is equal or less, you lose the challenge. <br/><br/>     Refer to that stage&rsquo;s Challenge Result list to determine the benefits or consequences of winning or losing the challenge.<br/>     You may attempt to evade a challenge. If you do so, add +4 to your attribution roll. <br/><br/><br/>However if you win, you get no reward.<br/><br/>Evolution Phase<br/><br/>     You may gain 1 Trait by playing 1 Trait card from your hand and paying its cost in food or resource tokens. The Trait card stays in play in front of you.  <br/><br/><br/>Metabolic Phase<br/><br/>     Discard 1 Food Token. If you have no food tokens gain 1 hunger token. If you have 2 hunger tokens, discard them and gain 1 death token. <br/>     Max hand size is 5 cards. Discard excess cards. <br/>     Determine whether your race moves to the next stage:<br/>         If you have 6 Trait cards in Cell stage in play go on Creature stage. <br/>         If you have 8 Trait cards in Creature stage in play go on Tribal stage. <br/>         If you have won against 5 villages in Tribal stage go onto Civilization stage. <br/>         If you have won against 7 nations in Civilization stage go onto Space Stage. <br/>    <br/>     If going on to the next stage set your old Trait cards aside in your Progress Pile. Except for and VT they might score, these do not apply to later stages. Select a new characteristic for the new stage and discard down to 2 FT or RT. <br/><br/><br/>The game ends after any player has completed his 15th turn in the Space stage at which point scoring is undertaken:<br/><br/>         Gain 5 VT for completing the Civilization stage and entering the Space stage. <br/>         Add up the VT bonuses from all the Trait cards in your Progress Pile. <br/>         Each Death Token counts as a -2 VT penalty. <br/>         Add or lose VT arising from Events and Challenges. <br/>    <br/><br/><br/>The player with the most Victory Point Tokens wins.<br/><br/>",

Each player will take on the role of the Captain of a salvage ship in the immediate aftermath of the sinking of the Spanish Silver Fleet off of the coast of Florida in 1715. Race other players to accumulate as much treasure and rescue as many survivors as possible. But, with nearly a thousand drowned sailors laid to rest under the waves, it will be almost impossible to avoid aggressive sea monsters out searching for a waterlogged snack!<br/><br/>You&rsquo;ll need to upgrade your ship to survive. Purchase cannons for attack, defensive porthole upgrades, and additional sails for speed from nearby merchant ships. Then, hope you're prepared for everything you haul up from the depths of the sea. The Captain who has salvaged the most treasure at the end of the game will be rewarded with early retirement, and the admiration of their peers.<br/><br/>Good luck, Captain. You&rsquo;ll need it.<br/><br/>",

Players are trying to locate the &quot;Lost Gemma&quot; (Latin for &quot;jewel&quot;) which is hidden among the growing ruins.  The game consists primarily of two phases:  Investigation and Search.<br/><br/>During the Investigation Phase, players decide whether to place their starting point card or draw and play something from their hand.  The former action can only be carried out once, while the latter forms the bulk of the phase.  With a few exceptions, cards played are added to the 5 x 5 grid that forms the ruins.  When players can no longer complete either of the main actions, play moves onto the Search Phase.<br/><br/>Players are hot on the trail of the &quot;Lost Gemma&quot; during the Search Phase.  The player holding the card with the lowest search value goes first and then turns continue in ascending value order.  Each player begins at their starting point card, chooses a direction, and then follows the path until they either locate the &quot;Lost Gemma&quot; or face failure (via a &quot;Dead End&quot; or by leaving the ruins).<br/><br/>The first player to uncover the &quot;Lost Gemma&quot; wins.  However, if all searches end in failure, the game ends in a draw.<br/><br/>The game was published for the Tokyo Game Market Autumn 2015 show, and features the characters from the Game Market catalogue.<br/><br/>",

You are finally old enough to participate and anxious to prove yourself to the other children. You will need to carefully scout the area for the biggest fish, cleverly maneuver across the crowded ice, and strategically manage your limited supply of lures if you hope to out-fish the competition. Do you have what it takes?<br/><br/>Eskimo Fishes is a competitive tile placement game in which players use an assortment of colored lure tiles to influence (and hopefully catch!) fish scattered throughout a modular lake map.<br/><br/>At the start of the game, ice tiles are shuffled and laid face-up in a grid to form the frozen lake and colored fish tokens representing holes in the ice are placed on each of the tiles.  Players&rsquo; turns consist of two phases: movement and fishing.  During the movement phase, players must move their Eskimeeple to a new unoccupied ice tile.  During the fishing phase, players manipulate a rondel on their player board to select a lure tile that must then be placed adjacent to their Eskimeeple.  After a set number of rounds, each fish is caught by the player with the highest sum of like-colored lures placed around it.  The player who catches the highest total value of fish is the winner!<br/><br/>",

If you've managed to hold onto the Ferret, you win!<br/>There are 4 animals in the game: The Ferret, The Fox, The Hound and the Weasel. These little rascals love to chase each other. The other cards are number cards (0-6) and action cards (Give Left, Take Right, Trade Anyone, etc).<br/>The cards are shuffled into an Number card pile and an Action card pile. The Animals are considered Action cards. Players draw cards and perform the actions on the cards. Play shifts to the left and the next player does the same. Play continues until someone finds the Ferret.<br/><br/>",

At the start of the game, seven piles are placed on the surface, each consisting of three neutral stones, and two of each player colors, for a total of seven stones in each pile, with each player maintaining the remaining seven stones in their color in front of them to form their stock.<br/><br/>Play consists of players taking alternating turns starting with black.  Each move is either the placement of a stone from their stock into a pile on the board, or moving any number of neutral stones and/or stones of their color from one pile to another, in order to create a number piles with 'primacy' in their player color.  There are a few small restrictions on moves that can be used by cunning players to strategically limit their opponent's viable options.  The first player to reach the target number of piles with primacy in their color wins.<br/><br/>",

The hell-spaces are ringed by 7 smaler spaces of the same color. These are called hell-yards. pawns caught in hell may be rescued by another pawn, that enters hell through the hell-yards.

They have long since swallowed the city, and no matter how much you uncover, they will continue their malicious barrage. They strike fast and without warning, unless you have the right equipment.<br/><br/>As prospectors in Lost Vegas, you seek to dig up what the desert has reclaimed. You can move from location to location collecting money and valuable artifacts. Barricade your locations from the storms, or you'll find yourself having to uncover what you've already worked to find &mdash; or get ahead of the game and use your radar to see where the next storm is coming from. After the storms have passed, the prospector who has the most money and treasure (points) from the locations they occupy wins.<br/><br/>&mdash;description from the publisher<br/><br/>",
