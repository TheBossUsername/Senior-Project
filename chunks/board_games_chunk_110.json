The object of the game is to be the last hamster left in play. There are several hazards that make this challenging:<br/><br/><br/>     The Conveyor Belt: You must keep moving up the Conveyor Belt or you'll get dumped off the edge into... <br/>     The Alligator Pit: At the end of the Conveyor Belt is a pit with one or more hungry alligators in it. If it comes down to a battle between a hamster and an alligator, my money's on the reptile. <br/>     Other hamsters: Other hamsters may try to push you into the Alligator Pit to increase their odds of being the last one in the game. Be careful! <br/>     Fatigue: The stress of constant exertion will wear down even the heartiest hamster. You've got to stop running eventually you know... <br/><br/><br/>Instead of using dice, Run, Hamster, Run! has players put chips in a bag to determine the outcome of contests. This use of chips creates a strong focus on resource allocation. As the hamsters take damage or become fatigued, they lose chips from their pool, further emphasizing the importance of careful resource usage.<br/><br/>",

Players then take turns fishing with the rod, with each player having two chances to catch a fish and reel it out of the box, before the next player takes a turn. The game ends once all the fish have been caught, and the player with the longest line of fish wins.<br/><br/>Another version of Angelspa&szlig; from slightly older players brings a die into play. On a turn, a player rolls the die before fishing. If she rolls a color, she tries to catch a fish of that color while looking in the box. Catch an &quot;out of season&quot; color, and you have to throw the fish back. Roll a starfish, and you choose the color; roll an octopus, and you toss one fish held by an opponent back in the sea; roll a boot, and your turn gets booted! The first player to collect five fish wins.<br/><br/>",

        "description": "The board is 5x5 with holes which are initially covered with reversible O/X pieces, all on the O side. Then a card with letters which align with the holes is inserted in the base. The first player uncovers two letters, making sure his opponent sees them too, then replaces the plugs, X side up. Play continues with the players alternating. After the third pair of letters has been revealed, each player may guess a word every turn. To do so, announce the word, then expose the letters (from the Xs) in the correct order. If correct, the player keeps the pieces removed and those letters can no longer be used. If incorrect, remove 2 points from the guesser's score. Once all letters are X side up, continue the process but flip the pieces back to the O side. Play continues until all the pieces are back to the O side or both players decide to give up. Score 1 point per piece.<br/><br/>",

        "description": "Based on the Swedish version of the TV show &quot;American Gladiators&quot;, where the players compete in different activities.<br/><br/>The game is for 2-4 players and is played out over 7 rounds, each one represented by a different minigame. In a two-player game the players take turns being the challenger or the gladiator. If the challenger defeats the gladiator in a turn they get markers/points which are used in the last turn. The winner of the last turn is the winner of the entire game.<br/><br/>\t\t\t\t<br/>\t\t\t\t<br/>\t\t\t\t\tThe different minigames\t\t\t\t<br/>\t\t\t\t<br/>\t\t\t\t\tGatloppet (The Gauntlet)In the Gauntlet the challenger tries to outwit the gladiator, while the gladiator tries to predict the challenger's next move. The challenger starts the game by picking cards of two different types. They then play one card at a time, the gladiator trying to match them. The challenger gets to move forward every time the gladiator fails to predict which card the challenger played. If the challenger gets to the finish line before running out of cards, they have won the round and get points depending on how many cards they have left in hand.<br/>\t\t\t\t<br/>\t\t\t\t<br/>\t\t\t\t\tDuellen (The Duel, orig. Joust)The Duel is a card based color matching game where the players simultaneously try to build ladders by combining cards with the same colored symbols on them. The game ends when one player can't continue their ladder. Points are awarded depending on how many cards are left in the player's hand, less than 5 yielding the maximum score. The challenger won't get any points if the gladiator finishes their ladder first.<br/>\t\t\t\t<br/>\t\t\t\t<br/>\t\t\t\t\tRingarna (The Rings, orig. Hang Tough)The Rings is a tactical challenge played out in six turns. The challenger must move over to the gladiator's space or reach one of the eight scoring squares by playing movement cards. The gladiator's role is to catch the challenger by ending up on their space or to prevent them from reaching the score tiles by blocking their path.<br/>\t\t\t\t<br/>\t\t\t\t<br/>\t\t\t\t\tV&auml;ggen (The Wall)In the Wall the challenger tries to reach the top before time runs out or the gladiator catches them. It is played out over seven rounds. In each round the challenger calls out how many spaces they want to move in that turn. They then spin a spinner numbered 1 to 12. The challenger gets to move if the spinner shows the same number or higher. In round 4 the gladiator takes up the chase following the same movement rules but using the gladiator's spinner numbered 4 to 15. The minigame ends after seven rounds or after the challenger has either been caught or reached the top.<br/>\t\t\t\t<br/>\t\t\t\t<br/>\t\t\t\t\tRekylen (Recoil, orig. Snapback)In Recoil the challenger tries to steal markers from the game board by moving their piece to the desired color. To accomplish this they must have the correct colored card in their hand. If they don't they can chose to play the card turned face down and spin the spinner to try to get the correct color. The gladiator then tries to respond with the same colored card or by spinning the spinner to the same color in order to protect the marker. The minigame is over when the gladiator has played all of their cards.<br/>\t\t\t\t<br/>\t\t\t\t<br/>\t\t\t\t\tAttackboll (Attack Ball, orig. Powerball)In Powerball the challenger tries to place cardboard chits in the receiver by balancing them on a cardboard &quot;spoon&quot;. The gladiator has a slightly larger &quot;spoon&quot; with which they try to block the challenger. The minigame ends when the time runs out.<br/>\t\t\t\t<br/>\t\t\t\t<br/>\t\t\t\t\tHinderbanan (The Obstacle Course, orig. The Eliminator)The Obstacle Course is the final minigame, the winner takes it all. Players take turns trying to match symbols on a track by turning over cardboard tokens, a bit like Memory. The player with the most points from previous minigames starts and gets a number of markers equal to the difference between the players' scores. That player gets to keep turning over tokens until they fail. If they fail and have no markers remaining, the next player gets to start turning over pieces to try to match their symbols. If they do have any markers, they discard one and keep turning over tokens until they are out of markers. The player who first matches all of their symbols wins the entire game.<br/><br/>",

        "description": "The Sesame Street 35 Years Anniversary Game is a trivia board game released by Rose Art in 2004 to celebrate the 35th Anniversary of Sesame Street. The game features two types of question cards, for &quot;kids&quot; and &quot;adults&quot;. Players navigate around the circular board while answering timed questions. The &quot;kids&quot; questions are designed to be simpler and focus more on the more recent years of the show's history and characters or topics taught by Sesame Street. The &quot;adult&quot; questions tend to cover a more broad span of the show's history and characters. Questions are based mainly on characters and other &quot;on-screen&quot; information, and there is little attention given to behind-the-scenes or production information and history. There are multiple choice, single choice, and true or false questions. Some of the questions are accompanied by a picture of the relevant character or object.<br/><br/>",

        "description": "&quot;Grab a color...but don't touch the sides!&quot;<br/><br/>This is a simple electronic dexterity game for all ages.  <br/>Twenty-eight plastic, chrome-plated rods are placed in holes through a conductive play field. The holes are about a quarter-inch wider than the diameter of the rods, and there are holes under the holes to keep the rods centered and vertical.  A handle with conductive, spring-loaded, plier-like pincher is wired to the base unit.  When the circuit is completed between the play field and the pincers, a loudish explosion sound goes off and a small light goes on.  The top of the rods are slightly flattened and have a piece of tape on the flat sides.<br/><br/>The game consists of rolling a big die marked with the three colors, and then using the pliers to pull out a rod of that color without touching the edge of the play field hole, ala Operation.  The instructions instruct players to grab the rods by the edges (non-taped) of the flattened top, I suppose to ensure a solid contact between the rod and pincher.<br/><br/>It's not that easy.  You have to watch carefully that you're pulling the rods out exactly vertical, and there's little &quot;feel&quot; using the pliers to judge the force you're using.  The circuit is very sensitive and doesn't let you get away with much.  The explosion sound was surprisingly loud the first time I tried the game, not at all like the Operation buzzer - startled the crap out of me.  Same thing apparently happened to the kid pictured on the box...  <br/><br/><br/>",

Each column has a blank space on either end (starting spaces), one blue space with a picture of a grenade, one red space with a picture of a bomb, and 4 spaces with a picture of a different target (there are 6 different targets).<br/><br/>You move up and down the columns according to dice rolls (each pawn staying in its column) trying to collect weapons. When two of your tokens land on matching weapon spaces, you collect a weapon - take a blue chip for a grenade and a red chip for a bomb. You collect two weapons (chips) of the appropriate color if you end your movement with all three pawns on spaces picturing the same weapon. If you land on your opponent, send them back to their start space.<br/><br/>Before rolling the dice on your turn, you can turn up a target card. Up to two target cards may be face up at one time. Each card shows a picture of a target and the 'cost' in weapons to successfully attack it. If you don't have the the weapons to successfully attack it, you lose all your weapons. If you 'Double land' (as described to collect weapons) on a target that is face-up, you attack it. You 'pay' the proper weapons to collect the target card. If you turn up a 'sabotage' card, you lose all of your weapons. First to collect 6 target cards wins.<br/><br/>",

        "description": "In this game, each player is an inhabitant of one of the continents. At the start of the game, each player will receive an assignment, which will involve visiting some location on another continent. When a player reaches his destination, he gets another assignment. The first player to complete all four assignments related to his continent wins the game.<br/><br/>Players travel across the board by throwing one or two dice and moving the exact amount shown. Players cannot pass each other, except on the airport spaces. If a player lands exactly on top of another player, that other player is returned to his home town. In addition, on some squares a player must draw a Route Card or an Action Card that will trigger some special effect.<br/><br/>The assignments represent certain questions that the player is supposed to find an answer to, such as Does apartheid exist in Latin-America? When a player completes his assignment, he receives a card which contains the answer to that question.<br/><br/>In the advanced version of the game, General Problems are added, which concern problems that aren&rsquo;t linked to one of the continents. Each player receives two cards describing such a problem. Cards describing the solutions are distributed among the players. In addition to completing their assignments, the players also need to find the solution to their General Problems. Certain locations on the game board offer the option to ask another player for the solution card, as do certain Action Cards. (One of these locations is New York, as headquarters of the United Nations.)<br/><br/>The expert version of the game adds the United Nations Securtiy Council to the game. Players visiting New York can now call for a meeting of the Security Council. During such a meeting, the players vote on the positioning of UN Armies. These armies block player movement. No player can pass them (but by landing on top of them, they can be removed).<br/><br/>",

Several copies were discovered in Zsch&auml;pe's garage in the course of a razzia against neo-Nazi activists in the city of Jena on January 28, 1998. According to newspaper articles referring to an official secret service report, it was sold by Andr&eacute; Kapke to fellow neo-Nazis as a solidary fundraising for 100 German Marks after the trio's disappearance into illegality. Kapke, however, diverted those funds. In the framework of the NSU trial, the game is used by the prosecution as proof for Zsch&auml;pe's political committment and her alleged active involvement in the murder of 9 immigrants and 1 police officer, as well as other capital crimes supposedly carried out by the NSU.<br/><br/>The aim of the game is to &quot;clean&quot; cities (the &quot;streets&quot; in Monopoly) of Jews. Instead of 4 railroads, there are 4 different concentration camps. There are fields for SS and SA (chance and community chest), gasworks (waterworks), and a field depicting Hitler.

If you choose the easy question and get it right then you get to the next place, but your turn is over. If your answer is not right, you won't get forward at all, so the only way to progress in the game is to know (or guess) the trivia correctly.<br/><br/>Winner is the first player to get &quot;Under the Clock&quot;. &quot;N&auml;hd&auml;&auml;n kellon alla&quot; (or, in it's full form, &quot;N&auml;hd&auml;&auml;n Stockan kellon alla&quot;) is a Helsinki saying and means &quot;See you under the [Stockmann] clock&quot;. The clock in question is the overhanging clock by the main entrance of the Stockmann department store, which has been a city landmark and a well-known meeting point in Helsinki since 1965. Thematically, the players have agreed to meet each other &quot;Under the clock&quot; and the first one to arrive made it in time, while the others will be late.<br/><br/>The game is fully Finnish/Swedish bilingual on purpose, down to every single detail; this is stressed out in the rules, to emphasize Helsinki as a bilingual city with both of the official languages of Finland, Finnish and Swedish.<br/><br/>A version of the game set in Tampere, the second biggest city of Finland was published in 2017: Nähdään Kosken Rannassa, and one set in Turku, the former capital and now the third biggest city of Finland, in 2019; Nähdään Täl Pual Jokke.<br/><br/>",

        "description": "In Scrabble, players use their seven drawn letter-tiles to form words on the gameboard. Each word laid out earns points based on the commonality of the letters used, with certain board spaces giving bonuses. But a word can only be played if it uses at least one already-played tile or adds to an already-played word. This leads to slightly tactical play, as potential words are rejected because they would give an opponent too much access to the better bonus spaces.<br/><br/>In Clue, players move from room to room in a mansion to solve the mystery of: who done it, with what, and where? Players are dealt character, weapon, and location cards after the top card from each card type is secretly placed in the confidential file in the middle of the board. Players must move to a room and then make an accusation against a character saying they did it in that room with a specific weapon. The player to the left must show one of any cards accused to the accuser if in that player's hand. Through deductive reasoning each player must figure out which character, weapon, and location are in the secret file. To do this, each player must uncover what cards are in other players hands by making more and more accusations. Once a player knows what cards the other players are holding they will know what cards are in the secret file. A great game for those who enjoy reasoning and thinking things out.<br/><br/>In Sorry!, players race their four game pieces from Start around the board to Home. By turning over a card from the draw deck and following its instructions, players move their pieces around the game board, switch places with players, and knock opponents' pieces off the track and back to their Start position.<br/><br/>Yahtzee is a classic dice game played with 5 dice. Each player's turn consists of rolling the dice up to 3 times in hope of making 1 of 13 categories. Examples of categories are 3 of a kind, 4 of a kind, straight, full house, etc. Each player tries to fill in a score for each category, but this is not always possible. When all players have entered a score or a zero for all 13 categories, the game ends and total scores are compared.<br/><br/>",

        "description": "A typical Flip Cup game can be played any number of ways depending on how many player are participating. Each player takes one large blue cup, six small red cups, and one black chip. Shuffle the challenge cards and place them face down on the table. A challenge card will have an activity for the player to complete. For example, the classic challenge card has a player take 6 red cups and put them on the edge of the table and who ever flips all 6 over first wins. A challenge card is randomly drawn from the stack and players take turns reading the cards. It is highly encourage to discuss the goal of the card so that players understand how the challenge works. If indicated on the card, players set up cups on the table before they begin. When they are ready the opposing players simultaneously say &quot;Let's get this flippin' party started!&quot; and begin. The first player to finish the challenge and yells &quot;Done!&quot; is the winner.<br/><br/>For smaller groups, the player with the most wins after facing other player is the Flip Cup Champion. If there is a tie, then the two (or more) players compete against each other in a Flip Cup Championship round.<br/><br/>For tournament-style play, draw three cards randomly and compete in a best of three for each round. Winners advance to the next round until only tow players are left standing, competing for the Flip Cup Championship. The Championship is one card only: draw a card at random and take your best shot at the title!.<br/><br/>",

        "description": "Myth &amp; Goal is a miniatures board game of fantasy football for 1-2 players, designed by James Hewitt and Sophie Williams. In the game, each player takes control of one of many unique teams defined by classic fantasy races, such as elves, dwarves, and orcs, and faces off against each other in a sport inspired by American football. While each team features players with their own strengths and weaknesses, players also choose a focus for their team that further defines how that team functions in the game.<br/><br/>Players use actions with their players to attempt to either throw the ball through the goal for points, or have a player run it into the goal for even more points. The team with the most points at the end of the game wins.<br/><br/>Using streamlined rules, custom dice, and highly detailed plastic miniatures, Myth &amp; Goal delivers an exciting and fast paced fantasy football experience that players won&rsquo;t find anywhere else. The modular team creation ensures that every player can easily find their desired playstyle combined with their favorite classic fantasy races. Players can also use the free agent rules to build their own custom all-star teams using different combinations of players from all available teams. In addition, players can watch their teams grow and develop using the league rules or practice their strategy on their own against an AI team using the solo game rules, both included in the core game.<br/><br/>&mdash;user summary<br/><br/>",

        "description": "This game, based on the famous book, is different from the 1975 version. You move along the board landing on Record Spaces. Some require a simple dice roll to break; for example, on &quot;Mostest Eating Baked Beans&quot; you roll 3 dice (1 red and 2 white) and if the red die is the highest of the 3 dice you break the record. If, however, you land on a Longest, Shortest, or Highest Record space, you must use the &quot;Record Maker&quot;. This is a shuffleboard device where you flick a disk down a track with numbers on it. If you set or break the record using it, the Scorekeeper writes down the number so other players will know what score to beat. When you break a record you receive the Record Card for that space - either from the Scorekeeper, or the player currently holding the card. The first player to reach the END HERE space with at least 5 Record Cards is the winner.<br/><br/>",

        "description": "Impartial game played with the 4x4 board full of one kind of pieces. A player may remove one or more adjacent pieces from a row or column. The loser is the person who takes the last piece off the board.<br/><br/>Note that the person who makes the last move loses. Making the last move to lose is misere version for most games, but the &quot;normal&quot; goal for this game.<br/><br/>A number of &quot;folk art&quot; versions of the game with a wooden board and marbles were found on the web. Computer program versions are also available.<br/><br/>The 4x4 game has been completely solved and it is a second player win.<br/><br/>\t\t\t\t<br/>\t\t\t\t<br/>\t\t\t\t\tHistory:The game was evidently invented by Piet Hein (also known for game Hex) in the late 1940's. It isn't clear if the game was originally conceived on an NxN board or a 4x4 board.  The game is in the public domain.<br/><br/>The first major publicity for the game was probably in Martin Gardner's Scientific American column in the February 1958 issue. The column and reader's responses were later re-printed in his first book collection of columns, &quot;Hexaflexagons and other Mathematical Diversions; The First Scientific American Book of Mathematical Puzzles and Diversions.&quot; Mr. Gardner notes that reader's analysis left no doubt that the 4x4 game was a second player win even though no simply strategy was found.<br/><br/>",

BloodLust is a fast playing card game for 2 to 10 players using the vampire genre. Beautiful cards, rules, and board bring the game to life.<br/><br/>Players add to their bloodline by staying out on the hunt, but the longer you stay out the greater the possibility of daylight; if you're out when the sun comes up then you could lose it all. Use your powers to best your opponents, or to help them, your choice.<br/><br/>Each player takes a character card which has variable powers.  Cards are flipped from the play deck one at a time. The possibilities are a daylight card, which raises the possibility of sunrise; a card which increases a character's bloodline; a slayer card, which injures the character or reduces the bloodline; etc.  Before each card flip players must decide whether to stay on the hunt with the possibility of additional increase or loss to their bloodline, or to get out and hold their bloodline gains for that round.  If players stay in and a daylight card is drawn that brings the sun up and any players still in the round lose all of their gains for that round.  A number of rounds are played depending on the number of players.  Players can play their powers and, depending on the situation, help or hurt themselves or other players.<br/><br/>The game plays in 30-60 minutes. It includes a box, mounted board, rules, cards, and counters.<br/><br/>",

        "description": "The Dingo Ate the Baby is a fast-paced game for 2-5 players, lasting 20-30 minutes. The goal each day is to collect enough cards within your ranch in an attempt to reach the total value needed for that day, without going over. This seems simple enough, but other players will attempt to sabotage your ranch, using animals, babies, sunlight and darkness to scare, chase, overpopulate, and even eat things within your ranch.<br/><br/>Setup:<br/>Deal a Player Starting Card, face-up, to each player. Set the matching player score markers on the Start/Finish space of the game board. Shuffle the 60- card play deck and place it face down on the game board in the space labeled &ldquo;Draw.&rdquo; Randomly determine the first starting player, who will also deal. The starting player changes each day, rotating clockwise.<br/><br/>Play:<br/>At the beginning of each day, roll the 10-sided die and set it in in a position where all can see. Add 10 to this die roll. This is the target value your ranch needs to obtain for the day. For example: If a 7 is rolled, the target value for the day is 17.<br/><br/>The starting player deals 1 card face-up into each player&rsquo;s ranch and 2 cards face-down to each player&rsquo;s hand. A player&rsquo;s hand is always hidden from other players.<br/><br/>Ranch:<br/>The initial face-up card dealt to each player is set directly to the right of the Player Starting Cards. This signifies the beginning of each player&rsquo;s ranch. The card directly to the right of the Player Starting Cards is always protected. This means that it cannot be removed by effects of other players but may be removed by a player&rsquo;s own effect. Any card played on a person&rsquo;s ranch is placed to the right of all the cards currently in that player&rsquo;s ranch. Whenever cards are removed, the remaining cards slide left to fill in any gaps.<br/><br/>Actions:<br/>When it is your turn, you can perform 1 of the following 4 actions:<br/>1. Play a card of any color into your own ranch. This card is placed to the right of all the cards currently in your ranch. If the card has an effect, the current player may resolve the effect but is not required to do so.<br/>2. Play a card into an opponent&rsquo;s ranch that matches the color of that player&rsquo;s starting card or the color of a card already in that player&rsquo;s ranch. This card is placed to the right of all the cards currently in that player&rsquo;s ranch. If the card has an effect, the current player may resolve the effect but is not required to do so.<br/>3. Destroy your own protected card. This can only be done if you have more than 1 Playing Card in your ranch. When the protected card is destroyed, the remaining cards slide left while the new leftmost ranch card next to your Player Starting Card becomes the new protected card.<br/>4. Discard a card. This allows you to draw a new card and also speeds up the current day.<br/><br/>At the end of your turn, you draw back up to two cards.<br/><br/>Special Rules:<br/>If a player plays a card in their own ranch that matches a color already in their ranch, they may choose to destroy their own leftmost (protected) card as part of the play.<br/><br/>Some card effects remove other cards from a ranch. When these effects resolve, the player playing the card chooses the target. The target can be a card in ANY player&rsquo;s ranch, not just the ranch of the player where the card was played. The target card may not be a protected card or the card immediately to the left of a special Moon card. Important: The player playing the card is not required to resolve any card effect and may choose to ignore that effect.<br/><br/>The following keywords all remove cards into the discard pile:<br/>&bull; Scare<br/>&bull; Chase<br/>&bull; Destroy<br/>&bull; Eat<br/>&bull; Stalk<br/>&bull; Stomp<br/><br/>Ending a Day:<br/>As cards are removed or discarded, they are collected in a discard pile in the center of the game board. When the number of cards in the discard pile equals twice the number of players in the game, the day ends. For example: In a 3-player game, the day ends when the 6th card is placed in the discard pile.<br/><br/>Scoring:<br/>When the day is over, the player with the highest ranch value, without going over the target value for the day, scores 1 point for each player they beat. In addition, each other player also scores 1 point for each player that they beat, so position at the end of each day is important. Players that exceed the target total when the day ends score no points.<br/><br/>Winning the Game:<br/>A standard game is played up to 15 points. When a player exceeds 15 points at the end of a day, the game is over, and the highest total (or tie for highest) is the winner. In the case of a tie, the players may share the victory or may play an additional day as a tiebreaker.<br/><br/>2-Player Rules:<br/>When playing with 2 players, it is recommended to not end a day until 6 cards have been removed or discarded instead of 4.<br/><br/>",

If you manage to get five 1s, you place five caps (see below) and take another turn.<br/><br/>The caps won must be placed in a straight orthogonal line, adjacent to at least one previously placed cap.  You lose the caps won if you can't place them.  You may even cap off part of another player's grid --this helps him somewhat, but may make the rest of his grid harder to cap off, by breaking up the pattern.<br/><br/>When playing multiple rounds, the winner of a round scores the other players' remaining cap spaces.<br/><br/>",

Every next element can be put on the field, but only where the side of the current element can touch the side of an existing element.<br/>If the side of a just-placed element touches the game field border, then the set of the connected elements scrolls in the opposite direction (or directions) if the element touches two borders. When this scrolling occurs, extra elements are deleted from the element set (they fall).<br/>The player randomly chooses the element which must be placed, and also the element which will be next. In the computer version, these elements are randomly generated by the machine.<br/>Every successfully placed element is counted.<br/>The game ends when the current element can't be matched anywhere in the field.<br/><br/>The game is designed by Jordan Tuzsuzov.<br/>Official internet site : <a target='_blank' href=\"http://devet.tuzsuzov.com/\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer noopener\">http://devet.tuzsuzov.com/</a><br/><br/>",

To do so, they must collect keys that open doors, gear that will help them on the way - for example, a rope will allow a player to use routes otherwise not accessible, a shield will protect them in combat, etc. - and face various dangers and creatures, many of which can be defeated with the correct gear. And, since this is cutthroat rather than co-op, they can of course battle each other too for the possession of keys or maiden chits - the real maiden will be in one of the six maiden chits randomly distributed in the castle's six towers, and the one who manages to bring her safely back to square one will be the winner. Good luck and - &quot;Courage and strength!&quot;<br/><br/>Note: There is a typo in this game's contents list. Trap and Ghost cards are listed as 15 each, but so far three completely separate copies have been observed that only have the same 14 cards in each deck.<br/><br/>",

Following the right (social) tactics and strategies are very important in this tiny world of irritation (with an actual irritation board) and friendship. In the end it's up to you to use the commotion, beleaguer, revenge, lucky and disaster cards in the right way.<br/><br/>The game is best played with 4 players, but 2-player rules are included.<br/><br/>",

The aim is to form continuous rows of one color, running horizontally, vertically or diagonally, until the first layer of the pyramid is complete. Once a floor is finished, the players count their points. Each layer is scored separately. Each alignment scores the number of balls that it has. Some balls scores several times if they are at the crossroads of several alignments.<br/><br/>On each floor, the plateau decreases a little more.<br/><br/>When the pyramid is completed, the players count the lines that appear on the slopes of the pyramid.<br/><br/>For two players, there are two options: Either everyone plays two colors, or players build a smaller pyramid.<br/><br/>",

To start a round, place two word cards face up on the table. (If the two words have fewer than ten letters, add another card to the table.) The start player then begins a clapping rhythm, then all players take turns calling out the letters in the alphabet to the rhythm, e.g. clap-clap-A, clap-clap-B, clap-clap-C, etc.<br/><br/>However, if a letter to be called appears exactly once in the words on the table, then the player should instead say &quot;Uuups&quot;. If a player says the wrong thing, speaks out of turn, takes too long, or otherwise goofs, that player collects an Uuups card. Each Uuuups card bears a letter on it, and that letter now counts toward whether a player should say the letter or &quot;Uuups&quot; in the alphabet recital. Players start the round again with &quot;A&quot;; if players run through the entire alphabet or three Uuups cards are handed out, the round ends and two (or three) new word cards are revealed. Once all the Uuups cards have been taken, the game ends and the player with the fewest Uuups cards wins.<br/><br/>The game includes variants to shorten or lengthen the playing time or make the game easier or more difficult. This last change involves players saying &quot;Schwupps&quot; instead of the letter or &quot;Uuups&quot; when a letter appears on the table two or more times.<br/><br/>",

        "description": "Biff Baff is the crazy Drumming-Game which will unleash your inner musician. With 13 fun and yet challenging gaming options each player can test his or her sense of rhythm. Just let loose and beat the drums along with up to three other players while discovering your own musical potential. You don&rsquo;t even require a conductor; the integrated rotary disk will lead you through the different rhythm patterns which you can choose for yourself. Different symbols for the disk ensure diversified rhythms and suspense for your games. The winner of Biff Baff will be the one who can keep the beat going the longest and is thus crowned the new drumming king. The whole game is made of wood which ensures stability and persistency. Playing the game will improve your sense of rhythm and helps building social skills for children starting at the age of three.<br/><br/>Game Explanation.<br/>The gaming board is divided into four colored sections which gives up to four players the opportunity to drum at the same time. Every section is imprinted with one blue and two red hand symbols which mark the two sounds (bass, snare). Additionally there is a white arrow which points towards the middle to the rotary disk. This disk fulfills the position of the conductor during the game. Up to six magnets can be placed on the disk which symbolize different activities like playing the bass drum or snapping one&rsquo;s fingers. To start the game one spins the disk once it stops the arrow   points to the action which has to be performed.<br/><br/>Biff Baff: Assisting development without anxiety but lots of fun! The game offers over ten types playing options depending on the age of the child which improve the following aspects:<br/><br/>- The importance of community and the role of the individual<br/>- A sense of rhythm and reaction time<br/>- Sharpening the senses: Auditory and visual perception<br/>- eye-hand coordination, emotional sensibility, body-awareness<br/>- Elementary mathematics: calculus, cardinal numbers, comprehension of quantity<br/>- Speech development<br/><br/>",

Players run auctions, make bids on collectable items, and challenge other players to deals.<br/><br/>Everyone begins with cash and a few bad checks. Play begins with the auction of an item you might find in a classified section of the newspaper, on Craigslist, or in the uniquely Maine publication, &ldquo;Uncle Henry&rsquo;s.&rdquo; Players take turns auctioning these Classified Items to each other and bidding on items to add to their own collection.<br/><br/>Each Classified Item has a point value. The most sought after Classified Item, the Moose Trophy, is worth 100 points. Lesser items, like the Blueberry Rake, are worth as little as 5 points.<br/>A player only earns the points indicated on a Classified Item when they collect the complete set of four cards. When two players each hold the same Classified Item card, one player may &ldquo;Downeast Deal&rdquo; to try to capture the set.<br/><br/>Downeast Deals are when bluffing becomes a major element of the game. Players might offer large sums of cash in a Downeast Deal, or they might just throw down a bunch of bad checks. There&rsquo;s no telling until the deal is done &ndash; and the savviest dealer takes the collection (or perhaps a large pile of cash!).<br/><br/>Play continues with auctions and deals until all of the sets are complete. The final scoring depends on the point value of the cards a player has &ndash; and the number of sets the player has. Having a moose trophy to hang on the wall is cool &ndash; but having a fly-fishing rod in your hall AND a lobster trap in your living room AND an anchor in your cellar is even cooler. Right?<br/><br/>Of course, collectors always run the risk of crossing paths with the village ne&rsquo;er-do-well, and Downeast Dealer is no different. Keep your collection safe from the Thief. If you don&rsquo;t, he may run off with your prized heirloom chest!<br/><br/>",

        "description": "Shuhari is a trick-taking game about mastering traditional Japanese arts, such as ikebana, the koto, and calligraphy.<br/><br/>The cards in the game each show 3 of 5 different suits, in an angularly radial pattern, so that each card has an outer suit, middle suit, and inner suit.<br/><br/>Each person will play 3 or 4 cards to each trick, one at a time in turn order, depending upon the player count.  Each trick also has up to three stages.  In the first stage, players are following the &quot;outer suit&quot; of the lead card.  However, if someone is able to following unconventionally, the trick proceeds to the next stage and players are now trying to follow the lead suit, but with the middle suit on their card.  In the last stage of a trick, players follow the outer suit of the initial lead card with the inner suit of their card.<br/><br/>Once the card play is completed, each stage of a trick will have a winner and that winner will notate having mastered the art corresponding to the lead suit.  During the game, points are awarded for mastering the different arts in the different stages.<br/><br/>Once the players have collectively fully mastered two arts, the game ends and the player with the most points wins.<br/><br/>",

        "description": "In this game, players strive for the best quality of life. There are different parameters - &quot;health&quot;, &quot;income&quot; and &quot;possibilities for personal development&quot;. <br/>The game board contains a circuit that players roll and move around. Different fields trigger different events or actions, such as choosing a job, buying a house or a car, environmental problems appearing, etc. Each player has markers on the scales for the three parameters, but the society at large (all players) also live in certain conditions, represented by low resources, a bad environment, etc. Depending on these, the actions of the players are evaluated differently. For instance, a player who buys a car pays money out of his/her income, gains personal possibilities but lowers his/her health. Depending on the environmental situation of all players, more or less points are deducted at the end of a turn.<br/><br/>A player who has completed a circuit places evaluation markers on his/her current situation. When all players have completed the circuit, the points are compared, and the player(s) with the best score in each of the three aspects gains points. After a premediated number of turns, the player with the highest overall number of points is the winner.<br/><br/>",

While it is comforting rekindling childhood memories with the time tested &quot;Dots and Boxes&quot; play pattern, there is still something new and different how the game has grown up in the meantime. Even though Trappex is quick and easy to learn, there is a depth of strategy that will keep you alert from your first move till your last. To play, players take turns placing their wooden &quot;wall&quot; pieces on the board, attempting to complete squares while preventing their opponent from doing the same. The player with the most completed squares at the end of the game wins. Trappex is simple enough to be played by children, strategic enough to engage a true gamer. The rules have been drafted so that there is always a winner, no ties, stalemates, or cat's games. Hand crafted from high quality hardwoods, Trappex is pretty enough to be left out on the coffee table or bookshelf to be played again and again.<br/><br/>",

The players represent the traders investing the money on behalf of the Bank. As the game progresses players are faced with ever increasing pressure to generate bigger returns to pay back deposits and stay afloat.<br/><br/>The winner is the player who remains afloat when his opponents have gone bust. To begin, each player takes 900 million from the Bank and places their private jet on the Market Opens square. The Bank&rsquo;s depositors are represented by a red sterling currency piece that also starts on the board, one square in front of the jets.<br/><br/>Players pay back their depositors at the start of every trading day. 25 million is due from each player on the first trading day, and the amount due doubles every day. Each player rolls the dice on his turn, and then moves both his private jet and the Depositors piece in a clockwise direction around the board for the number of squares indicated by the dice. A new trading day starts when the Depositors piece lands on or passes the Market Opens square.<br/><br/>The stock market is represented by a roulette wheel, and the roulette board is printed on the middle of the game board. Players go to market by playing roulette, with the returns on their bets being the same as those in traditional roulette. When the players land on a Data square, they collect market data, represented by stoppers. When going to market, players can place the stoppers in the roulette wheel, reducing the amount of open numbers and thus improving the odds of winning. Players still get the same return as in traditional roulette if they win. Players must contend with a number of other squares in the course of a trading day, including Data Wipe, Go Rogue, Arbitrage, Financial Regulator, Luck, and Banker&rsquo;s Bonus squares.<br/><br/>",

        "description": "Arthur's Realm, a.k.a. Realm of Logres, is a character-driven game set upon a rich tapestry of Arthurian lore, characters and events. Players have many choices, but players need only learn a handful of simple mechanisms to begin play. This is because the game is built upon a simple &quot;rules when you need them&quot; principle that puts most of the rules on a handful of reference cards that need to be read only when you need to play a particular situation. Because the system is intuitive and easy to start, players don't spend time reading and memorizing rules. Instead, they just play.<br/><br/>In Arthur's Realm, your choices as a player impact the story of King Arthur, and each time players play the game, it tells a new and fascinating version of King Arthur's tale. The game is competitive and collaborative, with one team seeking to usurp King Arthur while the other defends Logres and King Arthur. The action in the game revolves around quests, treachery, character romance, combat and magic.<br/><br/>Arthur's Realm plays like a Eurogame in that players cannot be eliminated from play. It plays like an RPG in that players must collaborate and it doesn't hurt to have a good imagination. Arthur's Realm plays like a traditional American game in that at some point you'll want to smite the opponent.<br/><br/>",

The task is not easy, since the Moominhouse is suddenly full of black hats, not all of which belong to Moominpappa.<br/><br/>Players roll the dice to move their coloured, hat-shaped playing pieces on the track around the Moominhouse. When a player reaches a Moominpappa-circle she can take one of the hats from the Moominhouse and try it on her playing piece; if it fits, she can keep it (some of the hats are duds and will not fit on the playing pieces). Players can also steal hats from other players if they land in the same circle, and landing in the Hattifatteners-circle means that hats in the Moominhouse must be reshuffled.<br/><br/>The first player to reach Moominhouse with 2 or more hats is the winner.<br/><br/>",

        "description": "&quot;A trivia quiz for the young and young at heart&quot;<br/><br/>Designed by the same core team of Otila &amp; Lindfors, this is a sort of companion game to Viisasten Kokous, but supposedly aimed at the younger crowd; which in this case means that this is a trivia game on the same general level of difficulty as Trivial Pursuit etc., compared to Viisasten Kokous which is extremely challenging to the average trivia player. The games were likely published concurrently (1987) or quite close apart, which make them among the last publications of Paletti.<br/><br/>The general idea of the game is to try and climb the rock on which the philosopher's stone (Viisasten Kivi) lies; this happens by picking cards and answering the questions correctly to move three spaces ahead, up to a maximum of two cards per player turn. Unlike usual trivia games, this is a bit more casual in that mixed in with the question cards are also event cards which work like event cards in a typical roll-and-move game ie. pass a turn, move ahead two, move back one etc., with flavor text. There are also blank cards which can either be used to make house questions or to be optionally mixed in the deck too, in this case a blank card simply means &quot;pass the turn&quot;.<br/><br/>Includes 150 cards; 100 question cards with 5 questions each, 25 event cards and 25 blanks, in three decks with tuckboxes.<br/><br/>",

In short, the idea is to collect the largest possible amount of feathers (which icons are shown on almost every card) and most annoy other players would not have a chance with us when it comes to counting points.

Each card beyond the value of the feathers (which is taken into account only at the end of the game) has a specific strength. The majority also has its effect, which we can use for example during the fight, whether or separately - consuming it his turn.<br/>You have to combine so as to eventually collect as many feathers. For this purpose, it is certainly useful Liars title card, but it also has a hitch - yes, gives the largest amount of feathers (3), however, the player who will be at the end of most &quot;Liars&quot; automatically loses. Remedy this, we can only exchanging with others (hopefully take us to the card), or finding a card Liar, which cancels the harmful effects of one of the Liar<br/><br/>important:<br/>the game can be purchased only in the set of the latest book Ćwiek - &quot;Liar 2.5&quot;<br/>rules have been on the last few pages of &quot;Liar 2.5<br/><br/>",

        "description": "Prehistoric pals make this award-winning math game fun! Kids roll the dice and move their dinosaurs around a delightfully illustrated game board, reinforcing counting, addition, subtraction and place value skills. Includes game board, 16 dinosaurs, cards, number die and instructions for various levels of play.<br/><br/>Each player is allotted one dinosaur for each of the four tracks (the tracks are labeled 1s, 10s, 100s, and 1000s). To play, a player rolls four dice to create a 4-digit number and then moves his or her prehistoric posse to the appropriate 1s, 10s, 100s, and 1000s places. Problem-solving strategies are honed as players scurry to get all four miniature mammoths or tiny triceratops into the dino haven, ahead of the other players' thundering herds. But look out! In the race to dino utopia, it's easy to get bumped by a baby brachiosaurus!<br/><br/>The Dino Math Tracks game provides multiple levels of play for a variety of ages. At the simplest level (perfect for a first-grader who knows Arabic numerals and one-to-one correspondence), kids use only the place track for the 1s. Later, cards with simple problems are introduced (&quot;Stuck in a tar pit! Move your 10s dino back two spaces!&quot;). At the most advanced level, players might encounter a question like this: &quot;Your 10s dinosaur forgot its pants, so it went back 15 to get them. Then it hurried forward 25. How far did it get? Move that many.&quot; Young players will find the 2-inch, spunky vinyl dinosaur playing pieces irresistible. The game offers plenty of opportunities for friendly competition and brain bending--not to mention lots of nonthreatening practice at addition and subtraction. --Julie Ubben<br/><br/>",

The players try to accomplish errand orders in order to win money quicker than the others, but they must respect the highway code or they will end at the hospital. The crossroads patterns can be changed quickly, and the policeman appears in a sudden to check if the bikes are in good state. The first to collect 20 euros and to get back to the concert hall wins the game.<br/><br/>",

The cards describe a variety of marine life, and list the other cards that can be &quot;eaten&quot;.

Both players have 8 checkers (men) in addition to the common chess pieces.<br/><br/>The goal of Men Row Chess is different from the goal of the common Chess: a player wins by capturing the opponent's king or stalemating the opponent.<br/><br/>All chess pieces move the same as in common Chess.  However, two rules are excluded from Men Row Chess: there is no castling or en passante in the game.<br/><br/>Checkers (Men) move forward or diagonally forward and capture the opponent's pieces by jumping over them the same way as in English Checkers, i.e. diagonally forward only.  A man can capture several of the opponent's pieces in one turn.<br/><br/>When a checker reaches the last row it becomes a king of checkers.  King of checkers can move diagonally or vertically (forward and backward) and capture diagonally, horizontally and vertically in all 8 directions by jumping over the opponent's pieces.<br/><br/>Ordinary checkers and kings of checkers are not forced to capture.  I.e. they can stop capturing the opponent's pieces on any step (even if they could capture more pieces) or skip capturing the opponent's pieces altogether.<br/><br/>",

Challenge friends and family as you Poppycock! your way through a series of quiz questions. Unsure of an answer but think you can get away with bluffing? Deceive your opponents until they shout out Poppycock! Clever meets crafty in this tactical game guaranteed to make you laugh out loud.<br/><br/>Choose a player to answer the first question. That player rolls the dice. The player to their right reads them the question from the category shown on the dice. If the dice is blank, the player answering the question may choose whichever category they want. The question, and multiple-choice answers, are read out, without the questioner turning over the card. The answering player must declare whether they know it or don&rsquo;t know it. If they don&rsquo;t know it, the turn ends, the questioner turns the card over and reads out the answer, and play continues clockwise. Discard the question card that was used and pass the dice to the next player.<br/><br/>If they declare they know it, the player must declare how many spaces they are playing for. The player can declare 1, 2, or 3 spaces. This represents how many spaces they will be allowed to move if they get the answer right, or if no one challenges their answer. Additionally, this number represents the number of spaces other players will be allowed to move if they correctly Poppycock! the player answering the question (i.e. if they can determine that the player is trying to bluff). Once the answering player has declared whether they know it, and how many spaces they are playing for, players take turns to say Poppycock! if they do not believe them, or Persuaded! if they do. Starting with the player to the left of the answering player, each player must declare Poppycock! or Persuaded!<br/><br/>If all players are Persuaded!, the answering player will move their declared number of spaces, without having to provide an answer. If any amount of players shout Poppycock!, an answer must be given by the answering player. This answer is checked by the questioner on the reverse of the card. If the answering player was correct, they move forwards their declared number of spaces, while each poppycock-er moves backwards that number of spaces. If the answering player was incorrect, they go back their declared number of spaces, while each poppycock-er moves forwards the declared number of spaces. When all moves have been resolved, discard the question card that was used and pass the dice to the next player. Proceed in a clockwise direction, with the player to the answering player&rsquo;s left being the next player to roll the dice and answer a question.<br/><br/>",

If you can not make a play, you must draw an additional tile. Play continues until one player has placed all of his tiles on the table, or until no other players can make a play.

(Originally it came from a machine gun, used a lot in World War I, and was made popular because of a bestselling war novel and film of this title.) The game however is an abstract speed game. It consists of 108 cards in 9 colours, denoted &quot;0&quot;, &quot;8&quot; or &quot;15&quot;. Goal for each player is to collect the most card sets in one colour, consisting of one card of each number.<br/><br/>Decks of each number are separated. &quot;0&quot; and &quot;15&quot; are each shuffled, and put as two face up stack on the table. &quot;8&quot; cards are shared evenly among players, and put as face down stacks in front of them. Determined by numbers of players, a given number of &quot;8&quot; cards are revealed from each players deck, and everybody tries to match the two face up cards from the common decks with their tableau. If they find the &quot;0&quot; matching to one of their &quot;8&quot;, they put it below their card. A matching &quot;15&quot; they put on top of their &quot;8&quot;. Once a set is complete, it is removed into a victory point pile and another &quot;8&quot; from the players deck takes it place. Game ends, as soon the decks are depleted.<br/><br/>",

        "description": "extrapolated from session report:<br/><br/>This is a 1996 Australian game by Bedford and Grigor for 2-8 players.<br/><br/>Each player gets a bike, car or truck. To move, you roll dice - 3 for bikes, 2 for cars, 1 dice + 2 for trucks. You can ram someone by moving on top of them, higher die wins, loser goes back a space, both cars suffer hit points equal to the opposite roll. If the mover wins, they can keep going.<br/><br/>If you move, you can also play an action card. These can fire missiles / guns / etc. at other cars, allow you to roll more movement dice, ignore terrain effects, etc. Unless the defender has a defense card, the attack card will specify a range (in range if vehicles are less spaces away than eg result of 2 dice) and the number of dice to roll to determine hit points. Trucks start with a lot of hit points to counter their low movement, bikes start with not many. Lose all your hit points and you can start again at half hit points, or attempt to hijack another car.<br/><br/>The track is about 100 spaces long, with some bridges / crossovers and 5 different terrain types. For example you need to roll multiples of 5 to move each snow space, 4 for oil spaces. There are obstacle spaces which allow you to pull an instantly applied obstacle card. These are a mix of mostly good and occasional bad events.<br/><br/>You can also pass and simply pick up an action card. Last car standing or first one past the finish line wins.<br/><br/>",

The active player picks a card from the two (s)he drew. Sitting across from each other, both players make eye contact and, without speaking or gesturing, try to communicate the card the active player picked. Afters some time, both play their card. If it matches, both get 5 points. If not, they get a second chance, and if it matches now, they can earn 2 points. If it fails again, they receive 0 points. After every person has played with every other person of the opposite gender, the game ends. Points are added up, Winner (per gender!) who has the most.

For some reason, most instances of these games come from the right wing (another game in the same class is Capital Punishment, which is much more vitriolic in its political commentary).<br/><br/>The &quot;object&quot; of this game is to &quot;go broke and go on Welfare with the help of government grants and boondoggles&quot;.  As the player tokens go around the board, their starting money eventually dwindles to nothing, at which point they no longer receive nor pay out money (ignoring the instructions on most of the board spaces) and exclusively draw from the Welfare fund (a separate pile of money) each turn they go around the board.  The game continues until the Welfare is exhausted, and the winner is then the player who got the most Welfare.<br/><br/>",

        "description": "An original card game showing &quot;how the consumer gets ripped off&quot;.  Each player is assigned one of the four categories of businesses, each of which sells goods or services costing 100, 200, 300 or 400 $.  Each player starts with 1000 $.  First player to amass 100 Consumer points wins.<br/><br/>On your turn, you roll a die.  If it is 1-4, you go visit the corresponding dealer.  If you rolled yourself, you pick one of the three others.  If you rolled 5-6, you draw a Consumer card and then go visit a dealer of your choice.  The Consumer cards give small Consumer Point bonuses or penalties, or small cash awards (up to 500 $).  At the beginning of each round, all players receive 100 $ each.<br/><br/>Each dealer has six cards, one Catch card, two Rip-Off cards and three Good Deal cards.  They are spread in front of him, face down, in any order of the dealer's choice.  The consumer then decides how much he will spend (100-400 $) and forks the money over to the vendor.  The dealer then rolls a die and picks up the corresponding card (left to right) from his spread; next, he chooses one of the five remaining cards.  Finally, he picks up the card corresponding to the amount spent (100 $ - first card, and so on up to 400 $ - fourth card).  Thus the dealer has limited control over what choice to offer to the consumer.<br/><br/>The consumer then draws one of the three cards proferred by the dealer (still face down).  If a Good Deal, he receives 10-40 Consumer points.  If a Catch, he receives half as much.  If a Rip-Off, he *loses* 10 Consumer points but has the option of suing.<br/><br/>To sue, pay 500 $ to the Bank, then dice off against the vendor.  If the consumer rolls lower, he lost the suit.  If he tied or bested the vendor, he is awarded compensation depending on the margin of success.  The least result is that he recovers the lost 10 CPs and is refunded the court costs by the vendor.  The vendor may be forced to pay such a large penalty that he goes into debt.  If your debt gets larger than 1000 $, you are  bankrupt and out of the game.  Whilst in debt, you cannot buy when your turn comes, but instead just draw a Consumer card.  All income goes to pay off the debt.<br/><br/>",

When they land on a space, they must follow the instructions on it: for example, Reggie makes players lose a turn, while short-cut spaces let players move their pieces further ahead.  Thief spaces, however, stop a moving piece in its tracks and hold it there.  Players must draw an Invention card each turn to obtain one with a number that matches the thief's to escape the criminal's space and continue moving.<br/><br/>The first player to land exactly on the Finish spot wins and ends the game.<br/><br/>",

The game is basically a race game to find all of the clues before your opponents and to drag the guilty culprit back to jail.<br/><br/>The game comes with large cardboard building that are placed on the board.

        "description": "DON: CCE is a new collectible card game that allows two players to assume the roles of the head of a Criminal Organization vying for control of a major city. The Player Don uses a wide variety of Associates and Family Members to attempt to bankrupt his opponent. In addition to henchmen, a Don may play actions directly from his hand to affect either his own Associates or his opponent&rsquo;s. The Don who bankrupts his opponent&rsquo;s funds is the winner.<br/><br/>DON: CCE is set in a timeless world of crime, containing elements from the Prohibition era through the rise of the modern mob. This fantasy world of the Mafia is simulated to allow players to battle each other in a spirit reflective of classic Gangster movies.<br/><br/>Player Dons use their tradable cards to generate funds, control vices and even whack their opponent&rsquo;s Associates. Game rules are provided to play Sealed Deck, Double Sealed Deck and Constructed decks for use in tournament play, multiple player, and direct head to head competition. The Capo starter deck is available now.  The Capo booster packs, available in Summer 2003, will add a wealth of characters, actions, and possibilities to any game of DON: CCE. The complete card set at present contains over 200 separate cards representing everything from a lowly Babbo Crew to the powerful Made Men and the infamous Penitent Wife&trade;.  The artwork is highly stylized to represent the classic gangster photos of yesteryear with hints of contemporary crime.<br/><br/>Using a revolutionary new game system, Dons are able to control cards in ways that other card games have never imagined. Each player&rsquo;s actions control how many cards he wishes to deploy as well as how many funds he chooses to spend.  In DON: CCE, each Don controls his fate through strategy, not luck.<br/><br/>Future expansions will add even more stylized elements of the genre, including more Law Enforcement, additional Associates, more Family members, and even more Vices for Dons to expand their &ldquo;businesses&rdquo;.<br/><br/>",

Three special six-sided dice are used; each dice has three red letters (an &quot;L,&quot; a &quot;C,&quot; and an &quot;R&quot;) along with three black dots.  Players start with three chips.  Each rolls the dice (never any more dice than chips) and distributes chips according to the roll, either to the player on the left, the center (pot), the player on the right, or no action if a black dot is rolled.  Play continues clockwise.  Players without chips can stay in the game because the rolls of others may give them some chips (hence the name of the game), but must pass on their roll.<br/><br/>Never Say Die, published in 1959, was republished almost exactly in 1992 as LCR.  There are two rules in Never Say Die that are missing in LCR.  First, players may permanently &quot;retire&quot; any number of chips over three that they own as individual winnings.  Second, the winner of the pot in Never Say Die is the player who holds the last chip not in the pot and who rolls a &quot;C.&quot;  It's possible that a player will hold the last two or even the last three chips not in the pot; in this case she may be fortunate enough to roll nothing but &quot;C's&quot; and work all her chips to the center to win.  If the player holding the last chip rolls a dot, she keeps rolling until she gets a letter.  The winner starts the next game.<br/><br/>This boxed game included a plastic dice cup (with snap-on lid), three dice, 24 large chips, and instructions.<br/><br/>Re-implemented by:<br/><br/>    LCR<br/><br/><br/>",

If he rolls black he can move his figure one space (front, side, back). If he lands on a space with a colored figure, he catches this figure. This figure is then placed on a space in the goal line, blocking it. If he rolls orange and has already captured a figure he can change the position of one of his captured figures on the goal line.<br/><br/>Player B moves the playing piece according to the rolled color on the die.

Therefore they need to buy launch pads, rockets  or the shuttle and the components itself. <br/>There are different types of rockets that vary in their ability to carry one or more modules and how much weight they can accept. Rockets can be used only once, whereas the shuttle is reusable.<br/>The game ends when one of the players picks the last module, rocket or extra card. The player with the most money (earned by successful installed modules) wins.<br/>The components are very well done for a self-published game, the first edition held 211 copies.<br/><br/>",

        "description": "From the author:<br/><br/>&quot;The rise of feudalism saw the continuation and subsequent peak in the rise of the armored cavalryman as masters of the battlefield. Most systems were centered around this element of the army. Battles such as Hastings tended to confirm their supremacy. By the fourteenth century there appeared in various nations trained infantrymen in numbers greater than previously hitherto. Battles such as Courtrai and Crecy were the first of many battles in which the infantry were to play increasingly decisive roles. Thus we see how the feudal system of castles and knights gave way to missiles and trained infantry. By 1500 gunpowder weapons were establishing a supremacy of their own, subsequent armies became balanced professional forces which are outside the scope of these rules.&quot;<br/><br/>Lance is a set of medieval 25mm miniature gaming rules that provides melee and ranged weapon attacks, terrain effects, leader rules, visibility and detection, unit formations, and morale.<br/><br/>",

        "description": "From the Publisher's Web Site:<br/><br/>Ramesses' War is a two player board game covering the ancient war between Egypt and the Hittite Empire. During the later stages of the Hittite Empire, circa 1400 BC to 1250 BC, the Hittite Empire had recovered from a period of weakness where it had been on constant warfare with the Arzawa and Mittani states. By 1290 BC the Hittites had managed to conquer Arzawa entirely and had captured the Mitanni capital, though elements of the Mittani people still resisted the further advances of the Hittites. Further, the Hittites had moved into the northern Palestinian region and had come to dominate Syria. This led to friction between the Hittites and the Egyptian, who themselves held large parts of Palestine and had ruled there for more than two centuries. Historically the showdown between these two powers culminated in the battle at Kadesh, initiated by Ramesses who had rallied Egyptian military might in order to directly challenge further Hittite expansion.<br/><br/>Ramesses' War is an easy to play two player game that lets you revisit that ancient conflict. However, the map provided expands the conflict to also encompass the various regional powers. Troy, an ally of the Hittites, plus Lukka, the Mittani and Ahhiyawa (Most probably the Hittite name for the Mycenaean Greeks), as well as providing units for an Arzawan rebellion and troops for each Palestinian city state.<br/><br/>The Ramesses' War Includes:<br/><br/>     2 piece, 17&quot; &times; 22&quot; color game map<br/>     37 Full-Color Hittite Counters<br/>     9 Full-Color Trojan Counters<br/>     8 Full-Color Arzawan Counters<br/>     4 Full-Color Lukka Counters<br/>     11 Full-Color Ahhiyawa Counters<br/>     37 Full-Color Egyptian Counters<br/>     7 Full-Color Mittani Counters<br/>     23 Assorted Full-Color Palestinian Counters<br/>     Game Rules<br/>     D10<br/>     4&frac12;&quot; &times; 5&frac34;&quot; &times; 1&frac12;&quot; Game Box<br/><br/><br/>",

        "description": "In August of 1914, the airplane had barely made its tenth anniversary, and had only just become a weapon of war. The Italians had used air power (if it could be called that) in North Africa in 1911, and Louis Bl&eacute;riot&rsquo;s famous trip across the English Channel was still a fresh memory.<br/><br/>The Great War was a time of heroes and villains, a war where everyone knew who was fighting whom and for what cause. Both sides had their great victories, huge defeats and plenty of trench foot. While this game is designed to simulate the greatest battles over the trenches of the World War I battlefield, we should not forget that men and women died for their beliefs and for their countries. Heroes were born of this combat on both sides.<br/><br/>At no other time in our warring history has there been such a change as the airplane. Not only did combat change forever once our soldiers were airborne, but a whole generation became enamored of this newest weapon in our military arsenal. Even into the twenty-first century, the romance and joys of those first years in the air evoke the deepest respect for these new knights, these men of the airways.<br/>Aces at Dawn is a game of quasi-historical combat in the skies. Set at the turn of the century, the game models the man-to-man combat of the World-War I flying ace and his dreaded enemies. As with all Majestic Twelve games, Aces at Dawn is fun and easy to play, works with any line of miniatures, and encourages players to use their imagination and have fun, which is the way wargaming is supposed to be.<br/><br/>With 36 planes at your disposal and a fully-customizable points system, you can build existing planes we haven't included and also try out designs that you think would have wreaked havoc in the skies of France.<br/><br/>The flexibility of the system allows players to recreate the man-to-man air jousting at the turn of the twentieth century. A simple combat and maneuver system means you can dispense with complicated maneuver charts and intricately detailed plane record-keeping. What&rsquo;s left on the board is just plain fun.<br/><br/>The ZIP file includes both full-color and printer-friendly PDF versions of the rulebook.<br/><br/>",

        "description": "&ldquo;Millennium &ndash; the millennium game&rdquo; (as it would be literally - and rather silly - translated into English) is a memory game with a twist meets a historical trivia game. The game board shows an event, an important person or anything characteristic for each decade from 10 to 2000 (with the exception of 500, 1000 and 1500) represented in nice comic art as well as text and arranged in a huge spiral covering almost the complete board.<br/>At the beginning of the game, the players cover 10 of the decades one by one with cardboard disks numbered from 1 to 10, while reading out the year and the accompanying text. E.g. &ldquo;10 Emperor Augustus&rdquo;, &ldquo;1060 William the Conqueror&rdquo;, &ldquo;1190 The third Crusade&rdquo; or &ldquo;1770 The USA&rdquo;. <br/>Each player then gets ten transparent plastic chips. The goal of the game is to get rid of these chips by correctly remembering the events etc. under the numbered cardboard disks. In each turn, initially the player rolls a d12. Then he has to repeat the decade and the text under the corresponding disk. Only if he succeeds, he may return one chip to the box and replace the disk on a new decade; in any case, the next player gets to roll the die. The 11 and 12 on the die have special functions:<br/>When rolling 11, the player may place one of his chips on a cardboard disk of his choice. The next player who rolls the corresponding number has to take this chip before trying to remember what is underneath.<br/>When rolling 12, the player asks the player with the most chips left to remember what is under a disk of his choice. If the other player succeeds, he may place one of his chips on the disk and replace the disk, otherwise, the first player has to solve the task. If he does not succeed either, the player with the most chips may give him one of his chips.<br/>Apart from the material described, Millennium contains a small almanac (30 pg.) with a short description of each decades event, person etc.<br/><br/>",

The rows are placed parallel to one another on the board. Two start and two destination fields are located on the ends of each row.<br/><br/>The turntables have each a different amount of fields. The first one only shows values from 1 to 3. The second one shows the values 3, 5, 7, 9 and several times 0. The third one can be used to try to double the number of fields your pawns can move.<br/><br/>There are 3 categories of cards : joker, super joker and stop cards.<br/><br/>For starters, each player gets 4 pawns (2 small and 2 large)of one color and 4 cards (2 joker, 1 super joker and 1 stop card). The pawns are placed on their start fields.<br/><br/>On your turn you can turn one of the two turntables with numbers. You can move one of your pawns accordingly. If you want to, you can turn the third turntable and try to double the distance your pawn can move.<br/><br/>A field can never contain more than one pawn. You can leap over your pawns.<br/><br/>If there are pawns on the fields parallel to the one where a large pawn is landing, the pawns on the parallel fields have to restart. Little pawns can never cause a restart to other pawns.<br/><br/>You can influence the course of the game by using the cards.  Playing a joker befor you turn one of the turntables will double your result. The superjoker can be played after you have turned one of the turntables to double the result. The stop card can be used to stop one of the other players during his turn, but only when that player didn't play a joker or superjoker.<br/><br/>The game ends as soon as one of players has placed his 4 pawns on his destination fields.<br/><br/>",

        "description": "From the Publisher:<br/>P.U! The Guessing Game of Smells! TM is a new concept in board games. It involves the player using their sense of smell to move around the board. The theme of the game is a race to the finish around through the village of Odorville. Players evade traps set by with a lively the naughty skunk StinkySmellsTM who makes the players smell different smells as they move around the board.<br/><br/>Odorville is made up of different venues where people today encounter smell. Rigorous market testing among kids and parents help identify the venues. The game starts out at a farm and then proceeds to the beach, garbage dump, laundry, candle shops, restaurants, outdoors, garages and ends at the carnival. The board is littered with over 300 elements of smell. Another innovative idea on the board is a changing path which changes according to the landscape the player is currently on. In the farm the player is on a dirt track which changes to grass in the maze, sand on the beach till it ends in cobble stones at the carnival. The best part of the game is not the board or the lovable characters but the scratch and sniff smell cards.<br/><br/>The game comes with 45 cards &ndash; 30 of them with smell and 15 cards that have no smell but require the player to identify things that smell on the board. The smell cards are broken in to 3 categories &ndash; good, bad and mystery. The game comes with smells like skunk, manure, peppermint, BBQ sauce, popcorn etc. Additional refill packs can be purchased with different smells or different themes.<br/><br/>",

The winner will be the one with the most money and property.<br/><br/>Players choose a coloured plane to represent themselves, and start out with a specific sum of money. They take turns to spin the arrow dice for the number of squares that their planes may fly on the board. Players have the option to build their house on the country squares they land on, but they can do this for free if they spin the arrow dice and it lands on &quot;Free&quot; (located on a different circle from the one used for movement). If players land on a space which already has property built, rent is to be paid to the house owner.<br/><br/>The game is similar in some ways to Monopoly, but with more options.

Each corner has a plastic 'gate' which is used to trap marbles &amp; score points.<br/><br/>Each turn, marbles are introduced one at a time into a rotating transparent plastic chamber which occupies the center of the gameboard. As they roll wildly and with great speed around the board players attempt to trap them with their plastic gate. Although it is possible to squeeze more marbles behind the gate, there are only enough small depressions to safely hold three at any one time. There are eight marbles per turn - seven white (worth 1 point) and a single red marble worth 6 points which is always introduced into the rotating chamber last. At the end of each turn scores are tallied and the next player spins the central chamber.<br/><br/>The first player to reach 12 points wins.<br/><br/>",

Each turn, the current referee selects a Description and players try to pick, from the cards in their hands, the Things that best match that Description. The referee then chooses the Thing that appeals most and awards the card to the player who played it. The unusual combinations of Things and Descriptions are humorous to the extreme, and will quickly have the entire room in an uproar.

Although the three game variants are different, they all give you 1 minute to memorize what's printed on 16 different tiles, then test your ability to remember what's on each tile after they've been flipped face down.<br/><br/>The first variant has players bid to the right to try to recall what's on each face-down tile.  The second variant has players move a shared pawn along the tiles, tying to recall what's on the tile the pawn lands on.  The third variant has all players write down what they can remember, then comparing answers.<br/><br/>16 Memories is a game for two to four players, although you could probably play it with five.  16 Memories uses a pawn, a die, a one minute timer, a custom board, and a custom set of tiles. A four-player game takes about 5 minutes to play.  16 Memories is  appropriate for Ages 7 and up, but all the players should be age-peers (A parent against several children would have an unfair advantage.).<br/><br/>",

        "description": "So you are looking for a new type of card game. Maybe you want a to give a great gift, or the kids are way too active and you want to give them something new to do. Maybe you are a student, or a teacher or maybe you just enjoy most everything about the Martial Arts.<br/><br/>Well...<br/><br/>Welcome to Martial World's advanced &quot;Trainers Edition&quot; card game. &quot;World Arts On Playing Cards&quot;<br/><br/>As most, who are familiar with our games know, Martial World is an American style strategy game, which challenges players to win martial arts based sparring matches, using technique based &quot;micro messaged&quot; collectible cards. These combat strategy card games combine point-trick mechanics with card-capturing mechanics for deck building purposes. We call the deck building process &quot;Building Your Form&quot;.<br/><br/>Each game box is designed for 2 to 5 players, intended for anyone ages 7 and up, comes with a single magnifying glass, (for a limited time) and no martial arts experience is necessary. Games are easy to learn, easy to develop flexible strategies, and average 90 minutes to establish a winner.<br/><br/>The fun is how cleverly the combination of multiple forms of martial arts technique terms, combine into round robin melees of attacks, blocks, and counter maneuvers. Here's how. Players spar in rounds which are initiated by the role of the dice and the round winners keeps the technique cards to add to their form. Another fun feature for players who are not sparring is that they may enjoy the micro messages which, for the white belt levels, display each school's core principals and values. You may even be surprised that most of these messages can be applied to every day life. So playing has good life benefits.<br/><br/>Ultimately our novel mechanics, embedded surprises, and our school based narrative features, provide players the opportunity to experience the many benefits of martial arts without the Epson salt. All may play and enjoy.<br/><br/>Designer's Note: All of our games are designed based on the history of real martial arts and may include many of each school's or style's myths. However folks, this is a game. Let's be honest, the only way to truly learn any form of Martial Arts is to do research and depending on your ideals, you will find a style which appeals you. Besides that, we are a USA based company and our games are made in America. We were originally published in 1992 but needed a lot of work. We kept pushing and in 2011 we were nominated for the Gaming Genius Awards as the best new card game. We were finalists but needed many upgrades. So we upgraded everything. Lastly we are members of our local gaming group CABS and have a membership with the Patent Tested Parent Approved association.<br/><br/>We welcome all feedback and recommendations. You may also zoom in to all of our pictures for samples of hidden surprises...<br/><br/>",

This movement becomes critical in Tag Team matches. Once your opponent's endurance is reduced you may attempt a pin. Your opponent can try to break the pin once for each count, if he doesn't you've won, proving you have what it takes to be a VON ERICH FAMILY World Class Champion!<br/><br/>COMPONENTS: The game comes with everything needed for play: a pair of dice, a gameboard, a scoreboard with four sets of scoring pegs, a deck of action cards, eight wrestler cards describing the abilities of the eight wrestlers, eight matching wrestler playing pieces with four plastic stands and a complete, easy to understand set of rules.<br/><br/>",

Years have gone by and while the Colonies tried to cover up history, they rediscover their need to explore the stars. <br/>The game takes place during this time, re-exploring the stars, building planets and defending against growing conflict.<br/><br/>The game features 4 colonies and 1 Pirate clan (optional). It is complete with 24 System cards to explore, Player Reference Cards, 46 units for each player, and Terraform and Population tokens. As well as the optional Pirate units on 1 more card.<br/><br/>Printing, cutting and mounting time: 1.5 hours (Mounted with self-adhesive Foamy sheets)<br/><br/>The players will manage Fleet, Ore resources and create colonies on other worlds, as well as battle over frontiers. <br/>The game requires at least 4 dice to play. Resources may be kept track on paper, but it is suggested to use a token system (like Poker Chips) in order to do this.<br/><br/>Note:<br/>System Vector was designed to be printed using Photos, and all printables are 4x6 inches, and are high-resolution. This keeps ink costs down, and makes things easy to carry and store. Overall I got all my cards, units and tokens printed at the Albertson's Kodak kiosk, and spent under $10.00 for all of it.<br/><br/>",

        "description": "Albiorix is an Icehouse game in which two players attempt to emerge victorious from a civil war of ideologies on ancient Mars.<br/><br/>The game is played with two stashes (one per player) on a 5x5 board. Each player starts with a varied collection of playing pieces comprised of two Icehouse pyramids, and one single Icehouse 3-pip pyramid. This singleton acts much like the king in Chess as controlling your opponent's singleton is the condition for victory in Albiorix.<br/><br/>You are able to move a piece if the topmost pyramid is in your color OR if the piece contains a pyramid identical to your current singleton. Direction and range of movement is dependent on the sizes of the two pyramids that make up the piece, with higher value pieces loosely corresponding to larger freedom of movement. Capturing does not occur in a traditional sense, but instead the two pieces involved (captor and prisoner) remain on the board and are re-structured according to the acting player's whim [provided the two newly formed pieces consist of no more than two pyramids and the topmost pyramids are not larger than the bottom pyramids].<br/><br/>When both singleton pieces are your color, you win.<br/><br/>Albiorix was designed by Don Sheldon and placed 3rd in the Icehouse Games Design Competition, Summer 2008.<br/><br/>",

        "description": "GOOGLY is a card game that simulate the game-flow of an actual cricket match (the instruction manual states the game is &quot;all the form and thrills of cricket without the Rain Stopped Play notices).&quot;<br/><br/>The game itself consists of 98 colorfully designed cards: 48 Batting Cards with blue backs and 50 bowling cards with green backs.<br/><br/>Gameplay begins by separating the 50 bowling cards from the 48 batting cards.  From the bowling deck a number of individual bowler piles are created (i.e., 5 piles if 5 bowlers are indicated by the defensive player). The batting cards are then shuffled and split into 2 piles (1 for each batsman), then the 1st batsman flips a card from his pile.  If a 2, 4, or 6 is played, the score is recorded and the 1st batsman continues play.  If a 1 or 3 is played, the score is recorded and the play moves to the 2nd batsman.  If a &quot;How&rsquo;s That&quot; card is played, the defensive player flip the top card from the &quot;active bowler&quot; pile (i.e., the pile designated as the bowler for the current over) and scores the result (i.e., run out, stumped, Not out, Leg-bye, etc.).  Batting cards are reshuffled every three overs; bowling cards are reshuffled every five overs.<br/><br/>The game flow and rules closely follows the real game of cricket -  an over consists of 6 bowled balls (cards) plus extras, batsman change sides after each over, 10 wickets taken constitute an inning, etc.  As with the real cricket, the goal of the game is to outscore your opponent over two innings.<br/><br/>(description based on text included in the rule book)<br/><br/>",

Blocks must be placed to fill the bottom row first; if you don't have a block to fill the bottom row, you can place a block on the top row. If the next player can fill this empty space, they must do so. If one or more blocks tumble off the plate on your turn, set them aside next to you.<br/><br/>The game ends one of two ways: Either a player knocks off three or more blocks at once, or everyone has placed all of their blocks. In either case, score points to see who wins. To do so, view the tower from above and count the number of blocks in your color that are visible, then subtract 1 point for each dropped block in your possession. The player with the most points wins.<br/><br/>",

        "description": "The WFF games (Shake-a-WFF and Count-a-WFF) are the first two in a series of 21 games called WFF 'N Proof. The two WFF games are concerned with the construction of WFFs (well formed formulas). A WFF (pronounced &quot;woof&quot;) is a expression in a system of mathematical logic that is roughly equivalent to a sentence in English prose. In the WFF games, certain sequences of letters are considered WFFs, and players attempt to arrange an increasing number of letter dice to create ever-longer true sentences, or WFFs.<br/><br/>In Shake-a-WFF, the two players practice recognition and construction of WFFs. Players use six capital-letter dice, six small-letter dice, and a Shake-a-WFF playing mat (one mat each). Each player begins with three dice, and seeks to create a WFF using the letters they've rolled. Each round, players add or subtract a die from their shaking set according to whether they successfully created a WFF in the previous round or not. The first player to create a WFF with eight dice wins the game.<br/><br/>In Count-a-WFF, two or more players simultaneously view the same set of rolled dice to try to create the longest single WFF from the letters rolled. Each player attempts to maximize their score for a specified number of plays; the player with the highest score wins.<br/><br/>The game includes 12 special lettered dice, 2 Shake-a-WFF player mats, and a 78-page rules and examples manual.<br/><br/>",

Goal is to educate about birds and to get familiarized with their world.<br/>The game starter set comes with 30 bird cards, which later hopefully can be expanded by new bird decks, so that all players could have more fun.<br/><br/>Players in different age can choose a difficulty level by their knowledge of birds before the game or can start with the easiest setting and enjoy how easy it is to later know birds by their song, looks and local names and memorize them. For that reason we believe the game is perfect for schools as a tool in education. The knowledge from the game will easily go over to the nature since the pictures on the cards are real life.<br/><br/>Why is it called Ilmatsalu bird adventure? Because Ilmatsalu in Tartumaa is one of the most densely bird populated are in main land Estonia and a favorite place for a bird tourists. Hopefully all local players later can take a real walk there as well and test their knowledge.<br/><br/>Game is played by moving around the forest (game board) and collecting information tokens for birds. Certain places ask questions and answering them, lets you keep the card. First one to collect certain number is the winner.<br/><br/>",

Duudsonit (The Dudesons) are Finnish Ostrobotnian equivalent to Jackass.<br/><br/>Basically this is a card game with the point scoring board. The player who gets through the board first is the winner.<br/><br/>In the game you play several episodes, which consist of player turns. In your turn you have four choices: Play A card, change a card, heal one body part or pass. When you pass, you are out until the end of the current episode. At the end of the episode player/players with the most publicity gets to go forward two spaces in the board. The player/players with second most publicity gets to go forward one space. The episode ends when every player passes or is unable to play cards.<br/><br/>There are three types of cards in the deck: prank, stunt and hassle cards. Hassle cards cause some kind of events to happen. You get publicity either by making pranks or stunts. Making pranks causes injuries to chosen player and gives you publicity. Making Stunts gives you both the publicity and the injury.<br/><br/>There is three types of injuries (two each): Leg, hand and bodily injuries. Getting injuries might unable you from playing certain cards. Injuries are taken randomly from the bag and positioned in the players personal player board. If you have all six injuries, you are sent to hospital and you are out until the end of the episode.<br/><br/>",

The same objects appear on all cards, but most objects on each card a silhouettes, with only two being actual pictures.  At the start of the game, cards are dealt evenly to all players.  Each player then turns up three cards to serve as his or her hand.  Each player then turns up a fourth card into the center of the table. Players look at these cards and try to match one of the objects (silhouettes don't count) with one of the objects on a card in their hands. The card can then be played on top of the middle card, as quickly as possible. Players may play on any card in the middle, not only their own.

        "description": "Puzzle Dice is a quick playing abstract game for two players in which the players draft dice from an open display over 12 rounds and place them on their individual player boards with 6x6 spaces. The dice come in 6 different colors and as they are rolled before the drafting can have values between 1 and 6. The aim of the game is to create lines, rows and diagonals of dice in which each color and or each number is unique. Sacrificing the scoring potential for a line, row or diagonal (by placing a duplicate color or number) gains that player a wild die which in a later round can be placed instead of a drafted die from the display. After both players have filled up their boards all lines, rows and diagonals that fulfill these criteria are scored and the player with the highest score wins the game.<br/><br/>",

NATO, Russian and Turkish Fleets are pitted against each other and the other minor navies of the region. You must form your ships into Task Forces and attempt to cripple the enemy&rsquo;s capital ships, carriers, and submarines. Your air assets must be carefully assigned to defensive and offensive missions. Most important, you must protect your supply and replenishment ships, or your fleet will be unable to maintain combat effectiveness.<br/><br/>Each 8-hour game turn is broken into 3 distinct phases (sub, surface, and air) and each player takes turns choosing which phase they wish to conduct. Ex. if the NATO player chooses &quot;Air&quot;, they conduct all bombing, shipping strikes, anti-sub, and interception actions for all their aircraft.<br/><br/>Players also use their units to attempt to &quot;detect&quot; enemy forces so that an attack can be made. Ships and aircraft are always detected once a unit moves close enough to them, but players have to roll to try to detect subs.<br/><br/>Optional rules include nuclear weapons and logistics.<br/><br/>Anatolian Fleet is a comprehensive simulation of the myriad elements involved in modern naval command and control. From Technical Term Game Company Anatolian Fleet continues the line of naval games originally from Victory Games Fleet Series.<br/><br/>",

        "description": "The Agenda Game, published in 2014, focuses on control of recent political issues, rather than the contest for electoral votes. It is a very slick and highly accessorized package, with a game board, seven large Agendas with platform planks to be achieved, plastic stands for these cards, corresponding player tokens, seven decks of action cards (Propaganda, Smoke and Mirrors, &quot;Dog Whistle&quot;, Media, Scandal, Talking Points, and Politica), a deck of money cards, two decks of vote cards, plastic discs for each agenda, plastic bars with sliders to record % of public support for each agenda, a pen for marking the Agenda cards, a microfiber cloth for erasing markings, and an hourglass timer.<br/><br/>Each faction card has a seven-point agenda. The board includes three spaces called Agenda Buttons, and when a player lands on one of these, he may enact as many plank boxes on his platform as his resources permit at the time. The winner is the first to achieve an agreed upon number of platform planks.<br/><br/>",

Players may build and upgrade their ships, send them to war and capture treasure ships. They will go through and have to make strategic and tactical decisions every turn. The more ships and upgrades you have, the more damage you do but often also the hardest you will get hit as your ships become more lucrative for other player to plunder. The player gains influential point as he acquires, attacks and plunder ships and other pirates that roam the waters of Caribbean!<br/><br/>In Boarding Party, there are 2 game scenarios, 1 draw pile, 1 event pile, 1 discard pile and each player has a fleet of ships. You start the game by drawing a hand of 4 cards and each turn you may draw 2 cards from either draw piles and play up to 3 cards on your hand. Each player assumes the role of a pirate captain with a unique ability. Balance comes from trying to increase your influence by expanding your fleet or attacking or protecting them from rival pirates. The player or faction with the most number of Ships and Upgrades in play when the game ends wins the game.<br/><br/>The 1st scenario (2-7 players), pitches all pirates against each other in the quest to dominate the Caribbean Sea and be the king of Pirates in the Caribbean. Meanwhile the 2nd scenario (5-7 players), players are divided into 3 factions, most with hidden identity and contribute to respective faction to gain influence and control of the Caribbean Sea by the end of the game.<br/><br/>Boarding Party is designed to be easy to learn and hard to master. It features 130 pieces of high quality illustrated cards thus being highly portable, easy to setup and durable while delivering an exciting gaming experience anytime anywhere<br/><br/>",

Players start the game with seven cards in hand.<br/><br/>On a turn, a player draws a card from the deck, then places cards down in sets of at least three &mdash; with a set consisting of cards with the same number, the same color, or the same pattern &mdash; or adds cards to an existing set of theirs. (For the first play, a player must lay down a set of exactly three cards with no jokers. After this, the player is free to play single cards and other sets, using jokers in sets as well.)<br/><br/>You can replace an existing non-joker card in another player's set with one of your cards in hand as long as you use the exchanged card immediately. At the end of your turn, if you have fewer than five cards in hand, you can pick up the top card of the discard pile, then fill your hand to five from the deck.<br/><br/>If a player has a set of five cards, which can contain at most one joker, the player calls &quot;Go5&quot;, and the round ends, with everyone scoring points for the cards in front of them and losing points for cards still in hand. If you can use the top card of the discard pile for a &quot;Go5&quot;, you can grab the card even if it's not your turn, and the round ends.<br/><br/>Players play a number of rounds until someone passes a predetermined point threshold.<br/><br/>",

        "description": "The Concept<br/>   In the game, players will be commanding their robots using the cards given. The game starts with Instruction cards where we introduce basic commands in simple code. Slowly game moves to resource cards on which bigger code with generic syntax is written. Robots will be executing these codes sequentially just in the way computers execute programs. The cards are written in Java but readable as simple English.<br/><br/>Anyone who can read and understand English can easily read and follow these codes, thus making it easy for kids and adults to learn programming. There are complicated code cards which will be used in strategy level, which are explained well in the rule book.<br/><br/>The Story <br/>   C.E.L.E.B (Command Executing Laser Equipped Bot) was developed by S.A.I.L (Secret Artificial Intelligence Lab) for military for war purposes. As the name says he can execute his human partner's commands and shoot enemies with the laser from his chest.<br/><br/>As a part of S.A.I.L's training program to choose the Commanding Officers for the bots, players are being tested against their logic and strategy in the artificial war zone. Shoot Cards will be distributed equally to all the players. First player starts the game by picking up the top card of Instructions deck and moves his robot according to the command on his Instruction card. If he gets to move to a new grid on the board using this card, he can collect the top card of Resources deck. When it is first players turn again he can choose between playing his resource and picking up a new instruction. As the game goes on, you will collect more resources and strategize your game better. As the robot moves on war zone it will collect important resource codes for it's partner which will help him strategize in the war. The player who reaches the middle of war zone first will be promoted as Commanding Officer. But you need to shoot at least one enemy robot before getting there.<br/><br/>Components<br/>  The game box contains<br/><br/>- 1 Game board (AKA) War zone<br/>    - A deck of Instruction Cards(codes)<br/>    - A deck of Resource Cards<br/>    - A deck of Shoot Cards<br/>    - A rule book<br/>    - 4 C.E.L.E.B game markers<br/><br/>",

The game has five suits (Crown being added as the fifth), and plays through as normal trick-taker, with players following the lead suit if they can. However, cards are played in a line, and if successive cards total to 11, the suit inverts. The second card becomes the lead suit. For example, the 10 of Spades has been played in the line. If a 1 of Hearts is now played, Hearts becomes the lead.<br/>&mdash;user summary<br/><br/>",

Each player tries to assemble their skeleton while preventing the opponent from doing the same.<br/><br/>Game play:<br/><br/>     Each player throws a tombstone to determine which colour their skeleton must have - black or red. Both players can play for the same colour.<br/>     Player 1 rolls their 6 skeleton parts (the bones). If a ribcage in the correct colour can be found all other parts in the same colour can be connected to it.<br/>     Player 2 does the same with his bones. Both players must start with a ribcage, otherwise they have to rattle all the bones again in their next turn.<br/>     Each play picks up the left bones and the die and rolls them together. If a missing part is shown on the die, it can be added to the skeleton. But there is also the colour changing side and the scatter side. Both mean the player has to start again. If the opponent already has the wanted part, the active play may choose to steal it from the opponent.<br/>     The first player to finish their skeleton wins the game. So the game can be over in 2 minutes if luck is on your side.<br/><br/><br/>",

        "description": "Charadspelet f&ouml;r barn is a charade game for kids. Each round one player draw one orange and one purple card from the two decks. On each card there is a picture. On the orange cards there is characters, eg ghost, trumpet player, waiter. On the purple card there is a chore, eg brush teeth, waves, is at the cinema. The player will try to show with movements what the pictures show. The other players try to guess. The player that first guess the whole solution will roll the number die and do cross off that many stars on their board. So does also the player that did the charade. If no one guessed right before the hourglass is empty no star are crossed over. The turn gets clockwise on to the next player.<br/><br/>The first player to cross off the last space on their board is the winner.<br/><br/>If your playing with older kids there is also three words on the cards that can be used instead. To determine which words to use there is two dice to roll.<br/><br/>",

Then we use Losers Detectors. Whoever sees Loser on it shouts &quot;Loser&quot; and takes the card. This is how you get your first Respects, which determine your victory.<br/>\t\t\t\t<br/>\t\t\t\t<br/>\t\t\t\t\tStage 2: Fighting for goodsThe first 4 cards from the Goods deck are revealed and trade takes place. If one player is interested in the purchase - he pays the fee and takes the &quot;shopping&quot; (not necessarily legal). If there are more Participants willing, the &quot;Robbing Losers&quot; takes place again, but only with the use of the Losers Detectors. Whoever wins gets the &quot;stuff&quot;. However, you should beware of the Ginger Snitch hidden in the cards. He will quickly inform the City Guard about shady business and bring inspection...<br/>\t\t\t\t<br/>\t\t\t\t<br/>\t\t\t\t\tStage 3: InspectionThis is where a participant playing the City Guard comes into action. It may select a delinquent to be inspected and reviewed. If the participant does not have anything suspicious on him, compensation is paid and the contents of the pocket are cashed. However, if he has a shady product, the City Guard confiscates it and returns it to the owner without any profit. Of course, you can try to bribe uniformed officers with a bribe, but they don't have to agree to it!<br/>\t\t\t\t<br/>\t\t\t\t<br/>\t\t\t\t\tStage 4: TradeNow it's time to count profits and exchange cash for Respects at the rate of 1 PLN = 1 Respect. As we know, their number will determine the victory. After all transactions are closed, the roles are switched: all characters move one player further (including the City Guard).<br/><br/>The cycle repeats for as many rounds as there are players (5 pawns are available). After the rounds are over, the exchange takes place and all accumulated Respects are counted. Who has the most? Who really &quot;rules the area&quot;? Just open the box to find out.<br/><br/>",

For example, if the &quot;Diplomatic or military success&quot; space is left uncovered then the government party gains 1% in the polls at the end of their move, while the the opposition party would lose 1%.<br/><br/>Unlike the original L-Game, this version does not end if a player is unable to make a move. Instead the game ends after a time limit, fixed number of turns or if the &quot;Snap election&quot; space is left uncovered the active player chooses to end the game.  At this point the support for the non-player Other Parties is subtracted from that of the leading Main Party to determine the winner.<br/><br/>",

There are four symmetrically positioned large holes in the central area of the playing surface; the underlying platform prevents any more than one of these from being open at any particular time.  There are four similarly sized holes towards the perimeter of the rink.  In each quadrant around the perimeter of the board there is an area for scoring and a small hole to secure individual bumble slides.<br/><br/>Players take turns to spin the platform.  When the platform is spun, players attempt to land their bumble in the hole.  Bumbles are introduced into the rink from player's slides.  If a bumble successfully finds a central hole that is open, that player scores a point for the round.

The problem is, all players are playing from the future and cannot communicate, you can only send signals!<br/><br/>Players need to work together to clear the Paradoxes by laying Flux Energy cards with different values to fulfill each Paradox objective, clearing it from the time continuum.<br/><br/>Each Paradox has a unique problem that must be fixed. Decode the paradox card and find out how to solve them. Once the requirements of the Paradox are met the Delorean is able to move to that space.<br/><br/>You must lay a card on your turn. You can play a card even if it does not help to fix a Paradox or if you cannot go or choose not to go you can reveal the next Paradox in the line. However this causes another Paradox to appear in the future!<br/><br/>",

When people learn about her unusual gift, they consider her a witch. So Elsa decides to run away, causing an eternal winter. Anna embarks on a great search for her sister. She is accompanied by Kristoff, who knows all the secrets of the mountain trails, his loyal reindeer Sven, and the funny snowman Olaf. Will they reach the ice castle of Elsa, or will the harsh winter thwart their plans?<br/><br/>Each player chooses one of the characters - Anna, Kristoff, Sven or Olaf. They all have various special abilities like doubling the pips on the die or adding an additional pip to the die, or rerolling a die.<br/>There are two parts to this board game. First, you roll a die and climb through the icy mountains to reach the rushing river. On the way, you must deal with the river's strong current, icy gales and an avalanche! Then to cross the river, you and the other players must collect five ice tokens. If you fail to do that, you all loose and the winter wins.<br/>The second part is where you must continue on your own. Tell a short story, sing a song or draw a character to reach the castle and win the game!<br/><br/>",

Movement is determined by rolling 2 dice, one to determine which color can be moved, the other for range. Rolling your own color or the neutral white allows you can move any piece of your opponents. The rules include a variation that permits blocking by stacking pieces on top of each other, hiding the pieces underneath.<br/><br/>A pleasant and simple dice game entry in the Edition Perlhuhn range, played on an interesting and atmospheric board with luck being a major factor.<br/><br/>1 year later described in Reinhold Wittig's SPIELECOLLECTION No. 1 Spiele zur Schatzinsel (1988)<br/>as &quot;Das verflixte Steuerrad&quot;.<br/><br/>",

A player can divide up his total move among as many creatures as he likes.<br/>4. A player can move his creatures forward, backward, sideways, or diagonally in any combination.<br/>5. A player can have up to 2 creatures on the same space at one time. You can move through a space with 2 of your creatures on it, but you can't stop there.<br/><br/>COMBAT<br/>1. When you move one (or two) of you creatures onto a space occupied by one (or two) of your opponent's creatures, you begin a Combat.<br/>2. During Combat, each player in turn spins the spinner once for each creature he/she has in battle. <br/>3. After both players have spun, the one with the most &quot;M's&quot; wins the Combat and gets to knock over 1 or 2 of the opposing creatures.<br/>4. Once knocked over, the defeated creatures are out of the game. Players leave defeated creatures lying on the arena, but those creatures are not counted as occupying space, and may be moved around as necessary to make room for more Combat.<br/>5. If both players spin the same number of &quot;M's,&quot; the battle is a tie and will continue after the player takes his/her turn moving.<br/>6. Once each player has had one chance to do battle on every space where his/her creatures are in Combat, it becomes the next player's turn to move. This player takes his/her turn moving even if there was a tie in the battle or if both players still have creatures standing on the same space after the battle.<br/>7. Play continues for the rest of the game with one player taking a turn moving, then a Combat round (if there are any Combat situations on the board), then the other player takes his/her turn moving, and so on.<br/>8.

Instead of paying in play money when landing on an opponents property square, you pay in points. If you land on a square that an opponent has placed in Receivership (similar to Mortgage in Monopoly) you can claim the property for free. The major difference from Monopoly is that the game has a strict time limit of 48 minutes at which point the game ends immediately and the player with the most points is the winner.<br/><br/>This game was an officially licensed product of the NBA.<br/><br/>",

Now you can bring all the razzmatazz and excitement of the NFL into your own front room - without the bruises.<br/><br/>Players aim to get rid of all their cards - but watch out, just as you are about to play the winning card there may be an interception.'<br/><br/>Starting with a first down card players take it in turns to try and  play cards in sequence (1st down, 20 yard, 10 yard, Touchdown or 1st down, 40 yard, 50 yard punt). They may either play a sequential card featuring the team of the card before it or play another 1st down card featuring a different team. If a player cannot go they must exchange one card with the draw pile. Interception cards can be used as wild cards. The first person to play all their cards wins.<br/><br/>These jumbo cards feature the official illustrations representing five of the most famous teams from the football league in the 1980's: The Chicago Bears, The Washington Redskins, The Miami Dolphins, The Dallas Cowboys and The Pittsburgh Steelers.<br/><br/>",

In your turn you place one of your tiles on the board to complete a row of three either of the same fruit or the same color or the same background shape. Each completed row of three earns you a chip, and of course you can complete more than one row with one tile and use rows already placed as part of a new row.

        "description": "Boolean is an abstract strategy game that uses the concepts of Boolean Logic to play. At first created as a learning tool by College Professor Edu Jacober, Boolean was published in 2011 by Ceilikan Jogos. It is now out of print.<br/><br/>Boolean is actually a game system and comes with two distinct sets of rules. The board represent a logic circuit with boolean operations that can be changed by playing cards on the game board.<br/><br/>Basic rules: Players are either black or white (0 or 1) and, by setting the logic gates on the game board, try to get their team to score more points. In your turn you can: a) buy a card, b)play a card. Circuit inputs are driven by a FIFO line<br/><br/>Advanced rules: Players are also either black or white and, by setting logic gates on the game board, try to get their team to score more points. In your turn you can: A) buy a card, b) play a card, c) feed a free input with a piece from your score track. Circuit inputs are copied from gameboard latches existent on more valuable locations in the gameboard.<br/><br/>",

        "description": "&quot;Znamenitost&quot; means Celebrity in Russian. It's a quiz game with a unique mechanic that provides infinite questions, and you don't need a game master to play it.<br/><br/>There are 4 different kinds of decks (24 cards per deck, 96 total).<br/>1. Facts: each card represents a fact from a biography (for example, &quot;She wrote a book&quot;, &quot;Something is named after her&quot;, &quot;She was imprisoned&quot;, etc.).<br/>2. Professions, such as &quot;politician&quot;, &quot;actor&quot;, &quot;soldier&quot;, etc.<br/>3. Alphabet: each card is a letter, which should be the first letter of someone's name, surname, pseudonym, or nick name.<br/>4. Countries, such as &quot;USA&quot;, &quot;Germany&quot;, or &quot;Russia&quot;.<br/><br/>Each round one of the players chooses a deck, reveals the top card and reads its text aloud. Then everybody tries to name a famous person that matches the task of the card. The fastest player reveals the top card of one of the remaining decks, and now the players try to name the person who matches two criteria, and so on.<br/><br/>For example, if the cards &quot;C&quot; and &quot;She wrote a book&quot; were revealed, it's possible to name Julius Caesar, Winston Churchill, Clive Barker, or any other person with the first &quot;C&quot; in his/her name (or surname, or nickname) and known as an author. If nobody could name a person after the next card was revealed, than the player who had correctly named the previous person wins a round. You cannot reveal more than 4 cards (one per deck): if someone has managed to name a person with 4 cards, he wins that round.<br/><br/>The game is played till one of the decks is depleted.<br/><br/>Contents:<br/>96 cards (24 per deck)<br/>2 blank cards for your own tasks<br/>rules<br/><br/>",

        "description": "EmotrionsOnCards is a strategy card game for all ages that belongs to the Emotrions line of games, which also includes board games (soon) and digital games (in development phase). The main feature of the Emotrions line is that it introduces the issue of Emotional Intelligence into a sector traditionally focused on the development of analytical intelligence.<br/><br/>EmotrionsOnCards is a really entertaining and addictive game. It's also easy to learn due to its few and consistent rules. There's a conscious balance between a distillate simplicity, which makes it possible for everybody to play in a more relaxed - &quot;light&quot; - manner, and a depth of game which will satisfy the classic strategy game hard players.<br/><br/>In EmotrionsOnCards, the cards, called emotrions, represent the basic human feelings: love, hatred, joy, sadness, fury, indecision... Some emotrions score points, others take them away. And they keep intermingling in your hand, when playing each trick, and even when you win!<br/><br/>It is very powerful as a strategy game. The miracle lays in its innovative logic, with negative and positive playing cards.<br/><br/>With only 36 cards and some minimal rules you'll be able to unfold many complex and shady situations. And you can also play different games with the same set of cards, such as The Pareo Game.<br/><br/>Strategy, psychology and luck <br/>EmotrionsOnCards sets off from a Standard style featuring a careful balance between Strategy, Psychology and Luck. But you may just as well alter this balance with The Winner's Options, to suit the winner of the previous hand. Thus, the most &quot;psychological&quot; players will prefer a more uncertain style, and the lovers of sheer strategy will demand a more analytical style. The possibility of modulating the game allows players with different profiles to enjoy, and feel the game as just right for them.<br/><br/>Philosophy<br/>All the game is a carefully made metaphor on how we manage our emotions, and other people's, in everyday life. As you try to master the strategy, you'll learn that in order to win in the long run (the game), it is always necessary to consider the effects of a particular battle (stake/trick), even if it means losing it.<br/><br/>The ultimate goal of the game is to make us reflect on the fact that in real life there's no such thing as obviously good or bad situations, but more or less complex positions in which the thin line between success and failure relies on our managing little things. It is possible to win, even if we get a bad hand.<br/><br/>",

        "description": "This game dates back to at least 1861, when it was published by John Jaques &amp; Son as The Royal Garrison Game. It is an extension of  The Siege Game, a.k.a. German Tactics which itself seems descended from Fox and Geese. In this game, 17 points of its 67-point game board are set aside as a garrison. Three officers begin play in the garrison, and fifty attackers begin play on all the remaining points of the board. Officers can move in any direction along any lines and jump over attackers to remove them from the board; attackers move only along vertical or diagonal lines towards the garrison and cannot capture officers, but instead merely try to swarm the garrison. To win, the attackers must occupy every point in the garrison, while the officers must capture enough attackers to make such occupation impossible.<br/><br/>This game has been known in English-speaking countries by a number of names, including Officers and Sepoys, The Royal Garrison, The Three Guardsmen, The Three Musketeers, Yellow Peril, and Bataan: The Battle of the Philippines!.  In continental Europe it has usually been known as some variation of Belagerungsspiel &ldquo;Siege Game&rdquo; or Festungspiel &ldquo;Fortress Game&rdquo; and was sometimes published together with its immediate ancestor under the same name.<br/><br/>",

Only tiles with 0 to 6 dots are used. One player is designated 'white' while the other is 'black.' The players take turn placing tiles on the board, starting with the player who is dealt the lowest numbered double-tile, who must place this a his first move.<br/><br/>Tiles are placed according to the following restrictions:<br/><br/>* A tile must be placed such that it spans two squares (i.e., one half of the tile is on a black square and the other half is on a white).<br/>    * No two tiles can share a square.<br/>    * If a tile is placed next to another tile, the number of dots on the touching tile-end(s) must match that of its (their) neighbour. If a tile-end is next to several other tile-ends, only one of these need to match.<br/><br/>When there are no un-drawn tiles left and two passes in a row occur (i.e., both players pass), the game ends. At this point, the unfilled areas on the board are scored: Each connected unfilled area on the board counts to the color that is in majority in that area. If there is the same number of black and white squares, no player gets points for the area.<br/><br/>The player with the most points wins.<br/><br/>",

        "description": "Hoo Hey How is a Chinese dice game with similarities to Crown and Anchor dice. This gambling game consists of three dice with six different pictures on their sides and a paper board marked with the same six pictures for stakes to be placed on them. This board could be self-drawn but you can get printed boards together with the dice nowadays.<br/><br/>The name, Hoo Hey How, is derived from the Hokkien names of three of the things that usually appear on the dice = a fish (Hoo), a prawn (Hey) and a king crab (How). However, modern dice tend to show ordinary crabs.<br/><br/>Dobree, in the 1950s, described the objects commonly depicted on the dice: a fish, a prawn, a king crab, a flower, a butterfly, a beautiful lady. But he also noted that other pictures could also appear: a cat, a mouse, a cock, a centipede, a tiger, an elephant, a gourd, three coins (Chinese cash).<br/><br/>Today, the dice tend to show more standard pictures and the selection of pictures is standardized for the region where they originate too. For example, the dice in Malaysia and Singapore (and I assume Hong Kong, where many of them are made) depict a fish, a prawn, a crab, a Chinese coin, a gourd and a cockerel. Thai Hoo Hey How dice (called Nam Tou Bu Bak [please excuse my bad transliteration]) have a tiger instead of a coin, as do dice from the Malaysian state of Sabah, but the Sabah dice show the head of the tiger rather than the whole animal. In Vietnam, they are called Bau Cua Tom Ca and often played at the new year: the distinguishing feature is a stag instead of a coin. Another feature is that the dice may be made of cardboard.<br/><br/>Many variants are possible, some that do not even feature the Hoo, Hey or How, so I don't know what they would be called. From Penang in Malaysia, I have dice that feature an elephant, a rabbit, a butterfly, a snake, a centipede and a flower. In Singapore, some older dice I have feature mahjong dragons together with symbols of political parties from the 1950s.<br/><br/>To play, one player takes the role of banker and the others are punters. Players stake money on the betting board and the dice are cast (either under cover or into a porcelain bowl). Punters are paid an equivalent amount that they staked, the number of times their picture appears on the dice (e.g. if someone bet on the fish and it appears twice, the punter gets back twice their stake).<br/><br/>This game is similar to The Game of Crown and Anchor.<br/><br/>",

First, players must decide if they play a certain level of difficulty, certain gender, or if they want a random game with all the cards shuffled together. The board is set upright between the two teams on two plastic feet and then both teams reveal a card for themselves only. They must then use the magnetic frames to mark all the letters appearing in the name - red frames are used to denote letters that appear in the name more than once.<br/><br/>The gameboard is then turned the other way around and now the actual game begins, with the two teams competing in who is the quickest to guess the other team's name. (It must be agreed in advance whether all names that fit the given letters are allowed, or only the particular one in the card.)<br/><br/>The winning team gets the card as a point, and the first team to get 10 cards is the winner.<br/><br/>",

        "description": "This game uses 24 checkers with 12 in each color and a checker board or a 6 by 6 grid as the game only uses the middle 36 squares of a typical 8 by 8 checker board.  Each player places his checkers in the back row of his side of the board.  The game turns alternate between the two players.  The number of checkers in a stack determines the distance that a stack may move.  Moves can be made in any of the eight corresponding directions and cannot be blocked by stacks situated in the path of the move.  All moves are done in a straight line unless the move would extend through 6 by 6 grid formation, in which case the move is reflected by the edge of the 6 by 6 grid like a mirror.  A stack belongs to the player whose piece is on top.  It might be noted that the arrangement and order of the pieces within a stack can never be altered except by continued stacking.  Captured stacks always remain on the board and become part of the stack must be included in the count for the new movement distance.  A player may use his turn to place a stack on top of another one of his own stacks.  During a turn a player has the option of moving one of his stacks or only its top portion which may include any number of pieces and may leave behind a stack also composed of any number of pieces.  The height of the new divided stack determines the new movement distance.<br/><br/>In 2005, the &quot;Too-Tall Rule&quot; or variant was introduced.  This rule states that at the beginning of a turn that any player's stacks taller than four pieces must be divided.  Failure to comply with this rule causes a player to lose a turn.<br/><br/>The game can be classified as a variant of Sid Sackson's Focus.<br/><br/><a target='_blank' href=\"http://www.stevecobb.com/Death%20Stacks%20--%20game%20instructions.htm\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer noopener\">http://www.stevecobb.com/Death%20Stacks%20--%20game%20instru...</a><br/><br/><a target='_blank' href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Death_Stacks\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer noopener\">http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Death_Stacks</a><br/><br/>",

        "description": "Isabelle &amp; Isabeau takes us back to the Mediaeval days when knights were bold and princesses charming! Bit like &quot;families&quot;, but the dice make the difference.<br/><br/>Basic Rules:<br/><br/>In this game, you try to win as if you were playing a game of &quot;pure&quot; families - indeed you need to build two families of six similar cards to win. But the dice make things interesting.<br/><br/>There are 3 of them: the first is a Character die that denotes either you or one of your opponents, and the other two are Action dice. Typical actions are: draw a card, place a card, discard a card, steal a card from an opponent, swap hands with an opponent, roll again etc etc.<br/><br/>When it is your turn you roll the dice. You will perform one of the actions on the Action dice, knowing that the other one must be carried out by the person shown on the Character die. You choose who is going to do what, and in what order.<br/><br/>Isabelle &amp; Isabeau game doesn't require any grand strategies, but the game mechanism conjures up some interesting combinations.<br/>You may discard most of your hand only to swap it immediately with another player. You may may need to choose between the lesser of two evils yourself. Memory plays an important role: knowing who has which cards in their hand can be vital. And jokers and &quot;veto&quot; cards add some extra twists and turns.<br/><br/>In short, this is a quick, fun game with lots of &quot;mediaeval&quot; illustrations. Oh, and did you get the pun in the title? No? Time to brush up on your French grammar, then...<br/>Isabelle and Isabeau has just been released in mainland Europe, and will be available shortly in the UK.

        "description": "The game comes with 8 Transformer pawns (4 Autobots and 4 Decepticons), 8 plastic bases, 2 plastic missiles, and 2 &quot;More than Meets the Eye&quot; dice. The pawns must be assembled before the game is played. The pawns consist of cardboard standups that can be flipped between &quot;Robot&quot; and &quot;Vehicle&quot; mode. There are 2 different ways to play the game -- one is a very simple dexterity game, while the Advanced game adds movement, die-rolling, and a couple of other wrinkles.<br/><br/>In the Basic game, players line up their Transformers in a row, one pawn on each base, about 1 missile length apart and about 4 missile lengths from the other player's Transformers.  The players simultaneously slide their missiles across the floor or table, trying to knock down the other player's units. The first one to knock down all 4 opposing units wins.<br/><br/>In the Advanced game, the sequence of play is as follows:<br/><br/>1. Each player may convert one unit between Robot and Vehicle mode. Only units in Vehicle mode can move.<br/>2  Each player rolls his special die, which he first secretly sets to Robot or Vehicle mode.  If he has no units in a mode, he can't use it. The die results allow movement, extra shots, protection from enemy shots, or repair of a previously hit unit.<br/>3. The players slide their missiles, trying to knock over enemy units. They must slide from behind their closest unit to the other side.  Based on the die results, a player may shoot once, twice, or not at all.<br/>4. First one to knock over all the enemy units at once wins.<br/><br/>",

The thin cardboard board is glued inside the bottom of the small box (box measures 7&quot;x10.5&quot;x0.75&quot;). There are five race horses, named for famous ones (Whirlaway, Citation, Twenty Grand, Seabiscuit, and Gallant Fox). The tiny plastic horses each fit in slots cut out of the 'board' which allows them to slide down the race track. They start at a column labeled Post, then travel through Quarter, Half, Three-Quarter, Mile, and Stretch, to reach the Finish. A built-in spinner has two labeled areas for each horse. Here are the rules printed on the board: &quot;All horses are lined up in POST position. Each player selects a horse to race. He spins in turn, then advances the horse indicated on the spinner, whether or not it is his horse, to the next position. When spinner stops on a line, spin does not count. The first horse to reach FINISH is the winner.&quot;<br/><br/>There are actually several different versions of this game published in varying decades with horses from that particular time period represented. In addition, some versions have a different number of horses (up to seven) represented. Finally, instead of having horses inserted into tracks, some later versions have horse playing pieces on a similar inlaid board.<br/><br/>Re-implemented by:<br/><br/>    Kentucky Derby<br/><br/><br/>",

Once you're ready, you'll need Tinker Bell's wand to set off for the ball, where all your dreams will come true.<br/><br/>The object of the game is being the first Disney Princess to get ready for the Dream Ball by collecting all of her tokens and Tinker Bell&rsquo;s Magic Wand.<br/>On each turn, players roll the die. Most sides of the die show the icons of the categories of the things you need for the ball. If the die shows one of the categories containing something you need, then randomly turn over one token from that category. If the token shows an item that is for your Princess, then you get to collect it. Take the token and place it in front of you, face up. If the token shows an item that belongs to another Princess, then show the other players the<br/>token and leave it there, face up for all to see.<br/>If the die shows a category from which you already have a token, then do not turn over any tokens this round. If the die shows Tinker Bell, you can take Tinker Bell&rsquo;s Magic Wand from the player who holds it. You get to keep the Wand until someone else rolls Tinker Bell. When you roll Tinker Bell, you can:<br/>- take one of your Princess tokens that is already face up<br/>- turn over a new token in any category and take it if it&rsquo;s yours<br/>- draw a Pixie Dust Card.<br/><br/>If you turn over a Pixie Dust Card with the image of one of the categories, you can turn over the tokens in that category until you find what your Princess needs. <br/>Once you have collected all 5 of your tokens, you&rsquo;ll need Tinker Bell&rsquo;s Magic Wand to be the first Princess to get to the Enchanted Dream Ball<br/><br/>",

        "description": "The year is 1931. In a suburb of the city of Chicago, prohibition is in full bloom and honest people violate more and more laws. Gangster syndicates spread and become larger, and speakeasies open in dark alleys. This illegal activity has now spread out to the smaller suburbs. It's now your turn to make the best of the situation for your family's sake. Will you become a gangster king, or do you think the stock market will go up after the great stock market crash a few years ago so that you will become a wealthy businessman? Gangsters and upper class people will clash in this board game. Will money win over weapons, or it will be the opposite? Form alliances with your neighbors, build up your arsenal of money or weapons, and let the game run its course.<br/><br/>In Suburban Dispute you fight your neighbors for the simple reason that you don't like them. The game includes three levels, starting quietly with annoying missions like stealing your neighbor's morning paper or milk, but each level you go up, the worse it gets. In the end, you will be conducting drive-by shootings and burning down your neighbors' houses.<br/><br/>The game board features a street down the middle, in addition to the score board, and each player places his house next to the street, with a maximum of three neighbors on each side of the street. The players can choose to be either gangsters or members of the upper class before the game starts, and based on what they choose, they receive specific traits that will help them through the gameplay.<br/><br/>Players then take turns drawing special mission cards and rolling a die in order to see whether they succeed with the mission. If the missions succeed, players gain either money or points, depending on the mission level; if the mission fails, then the police come to arrest them, and they lose either points or money, depending on the mission level. During gameplay, players also have the option of drawing special cards specific for gangster and the upper class which will, in most cases, be helpful in order to get closer to the end goal, which is to either collect 60 points, earn 15,000, or be the last player standing.<br/><br/>",

But you&rsquo;ve got to protect your critters from Mashin&rsquo; Max, because he thinks mashing critters is silly fun &ndash; and you lose all your berries if he mashes one of yours! He spins and slams and you can only win by dodging his big fists!<br/><br/>On your turn, you will make sure Max's arm is raised, then pull back a snail lever on side of the board that makes him spin about and then slam his fist down. If it lands on a space with a creature, that player's creature is removed from play and their collected berries are returned to the berry pile. Each space on the board also has a number and pictures of berries. The number is for movement and depending on the number of berries pictured determines how many you take from the berry pile. So, if the fist landed on a 2 when you sent Max spinning, you would move any of your characters that many spaces. After you have finished moving count the number of berries on that space and put them into your stump and play passes to the next player. The game ends when the berry pile is empty or all of a player's critters have been mashed by Max and the player with the most berries wins.<br/><br/>",

A Grey path separates the Red and Blue sides of the board.<br/><br/>Each player starts the game with eight pieces: two marked 1 (which move one space per turn), three marked 2 (which move two spaces) and three marked 3 (which move three spaces). These are also the victory point values of the pieces.<br/><br/>A screen is placed between the two sides and each player places their eight 'men' into one of the six huts (some huts may be left empty). Once all pieces are placed, the screen is removed and the game begins.<br/><br/>On his turn, a player may 'start' a piece (by moving it from a hut) or move an active piece the number of spaces equal to it's value. If a piece can reach an opponent by exact count, the opponent's piece is captured and removed from the game. If a piece reaches a hut, the opponent MUST start a piece from the hut on his next turn (if a piece is hidden there).<br/><br/>The game ends when one player moves 10 points worth of pieces across the Grey center path or, if both players have less than 10, all of his pieces (they highest total wins).<br/><br/>",

Should a marker land on certain spaces (rose stems and very long, Terry Gilliam-cartoon-like, winding arms), it goes backwards or forwards a certain number of spaces. A pretty simple, straightforward fare up until now, right? Right!<br/>Now the Pythonian fun begins... Several spaces along the track are special and come in three different varieties: Task, Trivia and Character Type.<br/><br/>Task spaces require the active player to draw a Task card and perform the task described on it (e.g. Explain your theory on spontaneous combustion in which must be included goats, a kettle, Venus, a jelly babies and a sock with a hole in it). The other players then vote on the active player&rsquo;s performance and, should the vote be positive, he gets an Award card (more on them later).<br/><br/>Trivia spaces require another player other than the active player do draw a Trivia card and read the Python-related question on it. If the answer is correct, another Award card is given.<br/><br/>Character types spaces have, well... character types on them (e.g. Canadian lumberjack, Spanish waiter, etc.) which the active player must take on as a persona until his next turn. If the other players decide he didn&rsquo;t put in enough of an effort, they can just move his marker back to the starting space...<br/><br/>Finally, the Award cards. Apart from some flavor, most of these cards serve no other purpose other than being able to display your proud array of awards. The ones that do have game text on them require the player to perform some sort of task until the end of the game to keep the award.<br/><br/>",

You mark half the dice numbers as belonging to the mummy, then roll the die.  If the mummy's numbers get rolled, he moves toward the goal; if not, then you move the actual number rolled.  Of course, your path is substantially longer than his.  You also are required to change the mummy's numbers each turn.<br/><br/><br/><br/>     Vampire Attack lets 2-4 players attempt to bite each other.  On your turn, roll the die, then move orthogonally with up to one 90&deg; turn per move, in an attempt to sidle up to another player.  Once you get orthogonally adjacent to an opponent, roll again.  A 1 (appropriately, the big, red pip) means you've bitten them and they're out of the game.<br/><br/><br/><br/>     Escape the Evil Castle is a spiteful race game for 2-4 players.  Players traverse a linear path toward the goal, advancing the roll of a die each turn.  However, your roll also moves Dracula, whom you can move in either direction.  If you move Dracula onto an opponent, she must move her pawn back to the 0%, 25%, 50%, or 75% mark.<br/><br/><br/>",

        "description": "One of Australia's many contributions to the world of gambling. The game is conducted in a flat circle of approximately 20 feet (6 metres) or larger. The only equipment required (aside from materials for tracking bets) is two coins (by tradition pre-decimal pennies), and a flat piece of wood called the &quot;kip&quot; approximately 8 inches in length which has holes carved in it to fit the coins neatly but loosely enough for the coins to come out when tossed.<br/><br/>The game is run by a &quot;boxer&quot;, who calls the first &quot;potato&quot; (one of the players around the circle) in to toss the coins. The spinner wagers an amount of their choice on either &quot;heads&quot; or &quot;tails&quot;. Other players around the ring can then also bet on either &quot;heads&quot; or &quot;tails&quot;. .<br/><br/>Once all bets are taken, the boxer calls &quot;no more bets&quot;, and the player tosses the coins in the air using the kip. To be a valid throw, they must go above the head height of the spinner, be rotating sufficiently and land entirely in the ring - if they do not the boxer calls &quot;barred&quot; and the throw is retaken. Ideally the call must occur before the coins settle.<br/><br/>If the coins land both on the same face, the round ends and non-spinning player's bets are paid off, with people who bet on the same face as that landed winning. A new round of non-spinner bets is then taken before the spinner throws again.<br/><br/>If the coins come up with one tail and one head, the spinner spins again. If 5 &quot;odds&quot; come up, all players lose and a new spinner is selected.<br/><br/>If the spinner throws his nominated face three times before either 5 &quot;odds&quot; being thrown in a row, or a spin with both coins being the opposite face, the spinner wins and is paid at 7.5 to 1 (in most modern games).<br/><br/>",

They take the President card and chooses their Minister by placing the Minister card in front of the player of their choice. The same player may be Minister more than once during the game. The other players act as the People.<br/><br/>The deck of cards is placed in the middle of the player, 4 are revealed and the cards closest to the deck is the most valuable, descending in value to the 4th card.<br/><br/>At the top of the deck, there's a symbol at the corners of the card, corresponding with one of the phrases on the President card. The President reads the cards to all players, for example: &quot;what would I like to bring to the desert with me?&quot;. The other players place their Voting cards (facedown) on each one of the 4 faceup objects.<br/><br/>The Voting Cards are then turned over to reveal the votes. Players score by correctly guessing which card the President chose. The Minister wins a point if they also chose the same card as the President. Each player who is not the Minister, can score an additional point if they guessed the Minister's card as well (if they both chose the same card and you voted for it, you get 2 points! If the Minister and President each chose a separate card, you only win a point if you guessed one or the other). The President scores up to 3 points, 1 point per non-Minister player that guesses his card.<br/><br/>At the end of the round, the 4 faceup cards are placed at the bottom of the deck. The new President is the player sitting to the left of the current President. The game is played for as many rounds as each player is President twice (in a 3 or 4 player game) or each player acts as the President once (5 or 6 player game). The person with the most points wins! In case of a tie, both (or several) players share the victory!<br/><br/>",

Trust us and let yourself be drawn into a new world of Autarcha.<br/><br/>The game takes place on the board, on which are marked various landscape elements: land, forest, mountains, rivers and cities. The board is perforated by transport links, such as road and rail. Each of these elements can be used in the game: Rail and road allow faster transport, forest and mountains hide the army and the cause that they are difficult to destroy, and the water stops, eg. Armor or artillery, which they can not overcome these obstacles. It depends on the player how to use elements of the board.<br/><br/>Most important is the general staff - in most scenarios, the destruction ensures victory. It represents the player and can give orders to the other four types of units:<br/><br/>Infantry - cheap unit with a relatively small range. Easy to recruit and rapid implementation to fight.<br/>Sappers - a specialized unit performing special operations, eg. Putting min, which in turn are invisible to the enemy<br/>Panzer - unit with a high cost, but high mobility in the field and long range.<br/>Artillery - a unit of positional far, code coverage.<br/>Branches can attack at a distance in their moves during the turn.<br/><br/>The game is included economic aspect, each player can build infantry and sappers in the city and armored units and artillery in our factory.<br/><br/>The game can be started in a simple way - choose the same set of units for each player, set them on the board and start the fight.<br/><br/>",

Battles are fought with rolling dice and comparing strength and stamina. When the heroes have found who the opponent is and where he lives, phase B - the confrontation phase- starts, which is played on the backside of the board and consists of one battle between the heroes and the boss monster and his surviving  adjutants.<br/><br/>",

        "description": "Batalj. This Swedish Alga game is essentially a newer version of the old Alga game Attack, which probably is related to L'Attaque. Therefore Batalj could be considered a &quot;cousin&quot; of Stratego. Designed by Count Sigvard Bernadotte, an uncle of H M King Carl XVI Gustaf of Sweden, and illustrated by Lars-Olof Jerhammar.<br/><br/>In the game you try to defeat your opponents army with your own. You only see the back of your opponents pieces so you don't know what piece is where. You try to use your stronger pieces to defeat your opponents weaker ones while protecting your weak ones. .<br/><br/>Differences between Stratego and Batalj:<br/><br/>-Batalj has 48 (2*24) pieces on a 64 square grid (8*8). Only the first 3 rows are filled in the initial setup.<br/>-Instead of 'Bombs' Batalj has 'Cannon'. Cannons can only be defeated by the value 3 piece (Corporal).<br/>-There are no 'Scouts' and the unit mix in general is slightly different.<br/>-There are no 'lakes' nor any other obstructions on the board. <br/>-Striking is mandatory and happens immediately when a player moves a piece to a square directly in front (but not on the sides or back) of an opposing piece. A victorious striking piece does not occupy the opponent's space.<br/>-There are no 'Flags'; winner is the first player to either eliminate or block all opposing pieces. In case of an impasse, the value of remaining pieces on both sides is counted and the higher total wins.<br/><br/>",

It is also called Laying Seige or Sham battle.<br/><br/>Rules.<br/><br/>First the player removes the four aces from the pack and places them face up in a column in the center of the table to form the foundations.<br/><br/>Then the remainder of the deck is shuffled and a column of four cards is dealt to the left of the aces, followed by a column to the right of the aces.<br/><br/>Succeeding columns are dealt on these successively, each column overlapping the last until the whole pack is dealt.  This forms eights rows of six cards in each.<br/><br/>The object of the game is to build on the foundations in suit sequence up to the kings.  The cards available for play are those at the far ends of each row.  They can be built directly onto the foundations or packed onto another available cards in descending order of rank, irrespective of suit.<br/><br/>When one row is emptied, it can be filled with any available card.  There are thus always eight available cards for play.<br/><br/>This game is quick to play but with many failures which can be frustrating.<br/><br/>Variations.<br/><br/>Siegecraft<br/><br/>This allows an extra cell for nay card to be placed on it the assist in uncovering key cards, making it easier.  The cell can only accomodate one card.<br/><br/>",

A sequence of ten small holes spirals from bottom to top of the beanstalk on each side.  Each of the holes is one of three shapes and these accommodate the stems of the plastic leaves players must insert in the correct sequence from bottom to top.<br/><br/>To start the game, all beanstalk leaves are placed inside the hollow beanstalk through a slot situated on each side.  There is a sliding apparatus at the base of the beanstalk which allows each player access to a single leaf on their turn.<br/><br/>The plastic beanstalk leaves come in 3 colors - green, gold &amp; black.  The green leaves have stems that will only fit into specific beanstalk holes and must be replaced inside the beanstalk if they do not match the next in the sequence.  Gold leaves are universal and fit into any beanstalk hole.  Black leaves are useless and are immediately replaced through a slot.<br/><br/>The first player to complete the sequence of leaves in order wins the game.  When a leaf is placed in the final hole at the top of the beanstalk, a spring mechanism is triggered which causes the 'sleeping' giant to pop up.<br/><br/>",

To do this, clues can be found in the richly detailed illustrated compartments, on a total of 47 puzzle cards with a wide variety of puzzle types. Who cleverly combines, finds the solution, and thus to the symbol of the following door. This is the mission: In a yellowed letter from 1803, which appears in a historical atlas, the explorer Lord Ernest Pickleton reports on a hidden Maya temple in Guatemala. Its exact location, however, is a mystery to be explored. Exploring the hidden temple is a challenge: only one room may be entered each day. The journey was successful if the heart of the temple was found within 24 days.<br/><br/>Now clever powers of deduction and creativity are required. Each family member can contribute his strengths. But don't worry, if you get stuck, a table on the back of the pack with 2 hints per puzzle and a breakdown of the solution will help.<br/><br/>",

All the animal cards are dealt out. Cards have 1, 2 or 3 colored animals on them: elephants, rhinos, kangaroos, monkeys or cows. Two Slap Cards are played face up, for example &quot;Four Cows&quot; and &quot;Three red monkeys.&quot; Players then sequentially flip over animal cards until exactly 4 cows or 3 red monkeys appear among them all. At that moment, players race to slap the corresponding Slap Card and win the round, taking the slap card as a prize and turning over another one. If you make a mistake and the required animals are not showing, you must return a previously won card to the bottom of the slap deck. When the slap deck is gone, players count how many they have won and the player with the most wins.<br/><br/>",

One deck is used to establish a large tableau on a circular gameboard which has 26 card slots around the circumference and four slots forming a central &quot;X&quot;.  The second deck also contains 8 wild cards. Seven cards are dealt to each player from this second deck. The goal is to lay off all the cards in your hand onto one or more of the four &quot;X&quot; cards. The twist is you must be able to dump your entire hand on a single turn. In lieu of this option, a player must try to play a card onto one of the 26 ring cards. Ring and &quot;X&quot; cards must first be &quot;opened&quot; by playing the exact same card on it. After this, cards of any suit may be played on open cards in runs of ascending or descending order. At the end of a turn, a player must play a card even if he was able to discard. If a player puts a card into a run that could have been used to open a card, he loses a turn and must take a penalty card from the player who catches him in the act.<br/><br/>",

You expand from your home planet, build ships and troops, send fleets out into space, battle for control of star systems.<br/>Several resources need to be balanced: population, energy, raw material, technology.<br/><br/>The boardgame has some nice ideas. Once you've set your fleets in motion, they will remain on their course, no calling back. Distances between systems is given on a chart, so it will take your fleet between 1 and 3 rounds to reach its destination. No battle in outer space, only in a system. Combat is done by rolling dice (one per relevant unit) adding the points and dividing by 6. This is the damage done to the opponent, counted out in units.<br/><br/>As pbm / pbem this game may have its merits. To convert a computer managed game to a board game was a bold plan, but one destined to fail. There is to much fiddly detail. Every system has its own little board and there are 42 of them. Plus one central board, plus one per player, all loaded with markers: how many resources, population, fighters, troops, docks ....<br/><br/>It's a sensory overload.

One die is red, the other is white. A card is drawn and the red and white dice specify two words on that card. A one minute timer is turned and you have that long to tell a story covering the theme you landed on and incorporating the two words you rolled.<br/><br/>It is the job of other players to identify which two words you rolled. The words of course bear no particular relevance to the theme and hiding them on the spot involves the creation of the most colorfully chaotic tales with impromptu decoy words thrown in as fast as possible.<br/><br/>The system of reward has gone lost to me, as have the rules, and I'm unsure of how points are scored, except to say that there is a 1-10 scoring bar in the game. How it is used I don't know.<br/><br/>I have written Crown and Andrews but they have been unable to find any records.<br/><br/>",

        "description": "Pepys game in which players compete to land the greatest weight of fish.<br/><br/>The game board represents a stretch of English countryside divided into a grid of 26 x 37 squares. Winding along the bottom end of the board is a river into which the 34 fish counters (of quarter, half and one pound varieties) are placed. The players start the game from the Fisherman's Arms inn and take turns rolling a standard die to move their pawn across the fields to reach the river. Once at the riverbank, a player can announce he is casting for any fish which is in a direct line (including diagonally) from his pawn. If his die roll is equal to the number of squares between his pawn and the fish, the catch is made and the counter is removed from the board and placed in front of him. Many fish, particular the half pound and one pound types, can only be caught by wading in the river, a process much slower than walking.<br/><br/>Any time a six is thrown on the die, a Hazard card is drawn and the instructions followed. These range from missing turns in order to light your pipe or chat with a farmer, to moving your pawn to Parson's Field so you can 'meet a friend'. When the last Hazard card has been drawn, no more fishing is allowed and the players instead make their way back to the inn as quickly as possible. Players score one point for each quarter pound of fish they caught and the first three players back to the inn score an additional three, two and one points respectively.<br/><br/>Although a terribly simple game with little skill involved, the board has a certain charm, evoking images of lazy, summer days in the country.<br/><br/>",

In So Sue Me! players acquire businesses in order to get income.  But just like real life, any business you own also means you are taking a risk of being sued.  Spin the spinner, and if you land on your own business you collect money.  But if I land on your business, I am likely to SUE YOU!  Five decks of lawsuit cards tell me why I might want to sue, and suggest different amounts for lawsuits.  The backs of the cards, which are unseen by other players show the odds of winning suits at different levels.  So only I know the odds of winning my suit against you.  But look out!  You may have an Unfair Advantage card, which acts as an odds modifier.  Only you know what your UA card says, so we will have to bluff our way to a settlement, or go to trial...<br/><br/>",

WHOEVER gets into a PASSION must be taken to the water and have a ducking to cool him... WHOEVER posses[ses] AUDACITY, CRUELTY, IMMODESTY, or INGRATITUDE, must return to his former situation till his turn comes to spin again, and not even think of HAPPINESS, much less partake of it.&quot;<br/><br/>Board measures 18 1/2&quot; X 15&quot; with split in middle of board (two pieces). <br/>1843 game board copyright Thayer &amp; Co's Lithog Boston<br/><br/>Publishing History<br/><br/>     W. & S.

Each player takes the part of an international wine shipper.<br/><br/>The players travel round a board using dice, in the usual way, matching GRAPE cards they collect along the way to WINE cards that they have to purchase (52 wines labels, of which only 3 are available at any time(face up)). By obtaining a matching GRAPE and WINE label, and buying a LICENSE, the player can then produce that wine, which earns them money.<br/><br/>The object of the game is to establish monopolies - there are only 2 WINES for each region, and if the player can produce both, they own that region. Target for a short game (90 minutes) is 3 monopolies, while a normal game (2-3 hours) is 6 monopolies.<br/><br/>This is not a simple roll and move game, as there is a certain amount of economics in the game - the value of everybody's wine is dependent on the VINTAGE, which changes periodically.<br/><br/>There is no need to have a knowledge of wine, as the information on what grape makes what wine is provided on the cards. So unlike &quot;The Wine Game&quot;, which tests your knowledge of wine, &quot;Connoisseur&quot; actually teaches you about it.<br/><br/>The game is well produced, with a nice board, printed in colour, and very nicely finished cards and playing pieces.<br/><br/>",

        "description": "Hof, at its most basic, is a 4-in-a-row game for two or three players, on a 6x6 board, using coloured dice as playing pieces. At its most complex it becomes a game in which players use identical sets of dice that all need to be manoeuvred into a sequential row, using the eyes to determine movement range.<br/><br/>At the start, players roll their own colour dice (6 in a two player game, 4 in a three player one). Then, in turn, players position these dice on an empty board space, one by one, and never altering the face value. When a player manages to create a horizontal, vertical, or diagonal row of 4 own dice, that player wins the round. The victor scores the total pip count of these dice, or the best dice string if the created row exceeds its required length. When all dice are on the board, and no row has been completed, players may move one own die per turn to an adjacent space, but not diagonally. The aim is to score the most points over a given number of rounds.<br/><br/>Anyone vaguely familiar with placement games won't find this much of a challenge, and for these players a couple of trickier variant rules are suggested. Any combination of these variants can be used, to eliminate randomness and increase complexity as desired.<br/><br/>- (2 player only:) to win, a row of 5 or even 6 is needed. <br/>- players don't start by throwing the dice, but use identical sets instead (1-6 or 1-4).<br/>- a winning row also needs to have the dice in the correct sequence, low to high.<br/>- dice may be moved as many squares as their face value, allowing directional changes too.<br/><br/>The designer isn't credited, but in all likelihood it is Hans-Jörg Nürnberger, as Hanje was the vehicle for Hans-J&ouml;rg and Ursula N&uuml;rnberger's own designs.<br/><br/>PUBLICATION HISTORY:<br/><br/>     1975 Hof Hanje Spiele-Atelier - out of print<br/><br/><br/>As with some other Hanje games, the small box is made out of wood, and the board is printed on its lid.<br/><br/>Game seems to be part of the family called &quot;Miniplays&quot;. There are 10 games numbered from 1 to 10 and two games with no number. HOF is one of the not numbered ones.<br/><br/>ADDITIONAL INFO:<br/><br/>     language skill needed: language neutral.

For example, the set 42, 3, 2 and 7 is also a factor set. Prime wild cards are used for prime numbers only. Adapts to 6 levels. For 1 to 6 players. Ages 7 to adult.<br/><br/>Prime Challenge - Players in turn form factor sets from a 12-card (or 10-card) foundation. Challenges are made by opponents when a player overlooks factor sets or makes a mistake.<br/><br/>Prime Solitare - To win, a player must clear a foundation by forming factor sets. This must be done before going through the draw pile once, one card at a time.<br/><br/>Factor Rummy - Holding a hand of 11 (or 10) cards, players try to be the first to fill their hand with factor sets.<br/><br/>Prime Canasta - A sophisticated Factor Rummy game. For serious game players.<br/><br/>SIX DECK LEVELS<br/><br/>The PrimePak deck of 171 cards adapts to many levels by removing certain cards. Six deck levels are defined in the rules booklet. Players play with deck level 1 (then 2 and 3) until they have mastered the multiplication facts. They continue playing at level 3 until they learn to think of numbers in factored form.

The play then alternates.<br/><br/>At each move the player whose turn it is has three options of play:<br/><br/><br/>     He can enter one of his pieces onto the board;<br/>     Move on of his pieces on the board; or<br/>     Capture an opposing piece with one of his own pieces on the board. <br/><br/><br/>The player wins the game who is the first to get an uninterrupted line from one of his own sides of the board to his other (opposing) side.<br/><br/>",

Each tile pictures the game's hero, a prince, with two different colors in the background.  The first tile for each player is placed without restrictions, one color on the bottom and the other on top, but subsequent tiles must match the color facing up on the previous tile.<br/><br/>Players alternate choosing tiles from the face down pile.  If they cannot place the tile, they return it after everyone has seen it.  There are also witch tiles for use in a version of the game for older children.  If a player draws a witch, all other players are forced to discard face-down the tile at the top of stack.  The first player to rescue Rapunzel twice wins.<br/><br/>",

Players create four lines of play using the four different patriotic suits. Players have the freedom to play as many cards as connect, or unit, to each other. For example, you may play a Seven, Eight and Nine of Stars, then play an Eight of Eagles. Play cards that connect to other players' cards. But when you change lines/suits then you will need to draw a &quot;Changes in the Wind&quot; card - so even when you think you have won, the round might not be finished.<br/><br/>User review: Each player is dealt a hand of cards. The number of cards dealt to each player varies with the number of participants. In turn, a player can add to the cards in the array in the middle of the table. Cards of the same rank are placed in the same row. The cards must be ranked in ascending order from top to bottom. Cards of the same suit must be placed in the same row. Event cards may be played at the beginning or end of one&rsquo;s turn. The &quot;Changes in the Wind&quot; cards are a separate draw pile. These cards are drawn whenever a player begins a new row.<br/>The hand is over when one player&rsquo;s hand is depleted. The other players are penalized for cards remaining in their hands. The game is over when someone has been penalized 500 points. The player with the lowest score is the winner.<br/><br/>",

There are four special stops at the railway: sea, park, playground and farm, players get a special tile when arriving  at each stop. Movement is determined by a spinner and the spinner shows both a color and a number from 1-5. Players can decide themselves to move according to the colors or the numbers (for the bigger children). The first player who arrives at the end-station with the four special tiles wins the game.<br/>The game looks nice for the young children and although it is supposed to play from 3 years old seems that it can easily be played with younger children as well because all materials and figures are from big, thick and strong pieces of cardboard.<br/><br/>",

        "description": "Mauseschlau &amp; B&auml;renstark: Deutschland entdecken is a roll-and-move and trivia game in which children learn about Germany and its sixteen states. In fact, the box contains two different games:<br/><br/>1) B&auml;renstarkes Reisespiel (ages 5 and up)<br/><br/>In this roll-and-move game players visit the regional capital cities. The first player to reach a city wins the state's coat of arms (chips that are placed on designated spaces on the board). Players take turns rolling the die and moving their pawn according to the result of the die roll in the direction of their choice. If they reach a yellow space with a red border, they get to take the coat of arms of that federal state. Some cities can also be reached by train or plane, but to use these, the player first has to earn a train or plane action chip. Action chips are collected by landing on action spaces. Apart from train or plane tickets, there are also action chips that gain or lose you a turn or win you a coat of arms. The game ends when all coats of arms have been collected. The player with the most coats of arms wins.<br/><br/>2) Mauseschlaue Wissenstour (ages 7 and up)<br/><br/>The aim of this game is to collect as many cards and coats of arms as possible. Players take turns rolling the die and moving their pawn according to the result of the die roll. If they land on an orange space, one of the other players takes a card and reads the tasks. If the active player succeeds in answering the question or performing the action, she wins the card. Each card also displays the coat of arms of a state. When a player has won two cards assigned to the same state, she gets to take the coat of arms chip of that state as well. Coat of arms chips that other players have won can be taken from them if a player collects more cards about the same state than its current owner. The game ends after one or two rounds (players' choice) as soon as a player reaches her starting space. The player with the highest number of points &ndash; with a card being worth one point, and a coat of arms two &ndash; wins.<br/><br/>",

The goal of the game is to collect the blocks needed to build your creature.<br/><br/>To do this, you move your pawn around on a board using a spinner.  If you land on a blue space, you can flip it over to reveal a picture of a block.  If it is part of your creature you can collect the block.  If not, return the space face down.<br/><br/>Players continue spinning and moving around the board revealing spaces and collecting blocks until someone collects all the blocks for their creature.  Other spaces on the board include grey spaces, which do nothing, spin again spaces which let you take another turn, and 'go-anywhere' spaces which let you place your pawn on any space you want.<br/><br/>",

        "description": "Chikken is a game of dice, risk, strategy, and luck.  It's designed for two to six players of any age, as long as they can understand how to make matches with dice.<br/><br/>The goal is to get as high a score as possible without losing your turn. To do this, you roll five special dice (four white, one red), each with one side blank. The red die is called the &quot;Danger Die.&quot;  If at any time you roll all white blanks, or you roll a red blank, your turn ends without scoring.<br/><br/>You score points by making three/four/five-of-a-kind matches or a straight (1-2-3-4-5). After each roll, you can stop and bank your points (gaining bonus points for matches, plus the total of all spots on the dice), or you can set aside dice of your choice and reroll what's left. However, you MUST set aside any blank white dice after each roll.<br/><br/>An added element of risk management comes when you have a bonus score available, such as from four-of-a-kind. When you do, you have the extra choice of hanging onto those bonus points and rerolling all five dice, with the bonus score still in jeopardy if you should roll blanks and lose your turn. This lets you &quot;start over&quot; with a higher starting value, but all the same risks of losing your turn.<br/><br/>Educational Value<br/><br/>Chikken teaches kids to understand and analyze risks. For younger kids, it's a matching game, and for slightly older ones, they can count up spots, or add up the numbers as they go. And it's still fun for everyone!<br/><br/>",

        "description": "A variant of the classic golf card game in which each player puts cards before them on the table in a grid.  Each player plays new cards striving for a low scoring grid (sets do not count against you)  The game is played over 9 rounds, like a 9 hole golf game.<br/><br/>Paddy O'Shea's version of the game introduces special cards to a pair of traditional 52 card decks.  The special cards include 19th Hole Wild Cards (worth -5 points) and &quot;Good for Nothing&quot; (0 point) mulligan cards. There are also regular jokers and rules that differ slightly from the classic game.<br/><br/>",

You can choose your representative between dog or cat, who fights to win in the backyard.<br/><br/>All cards will be shuffled and distributed 5 cards per each player.Every player will get the health-token depends on the number of players. For example, 3-5 people will receive 4 tokens per person while 6-8 players will get 5 tokens for each player.Players need to draw a card and set some traps to make competitors lose their health points. Following the rules, you have to tell your opponents some details of those traps that you set up. For example, types of those traps (real trap or fake trap). Moreover, each player needs to bluff and challenge other players to remove the set-up traps or decide to keep those traps there. In case that your opponents remove the real trap, they will not lose any health point. Nevertheless, If they make a wrong decision by keeping them or remove the fake one, they will lose their health points. In the latter case, the player (yourself) who sets up the traps will earn the health point instead. Please see the full description of this game by reading in the later part. (How to play section) Keep in mind that you should not trust anyone but should be aware of what others keep saying. The real relationship might not exist on this backyard.<br/><br/>",

Players spin to determine how far they can move (0-6 spaces) their pawns and the first player to reach the Elf's location gains a token worth 1-3 points.

Each player controls 3 committee members on a 12x9 board. Each turn, a player moves one of his committee members in a straight line, and then places two blocking pieces (Ducosim members) on a spot where two of his committee members could move to. A player controls an enclosed area if he has the only committee member there.<br/>The person with the most enclosed squares (most are worth 1, some 11) wins the game when a player can take no more moves.<br/><br/>",
